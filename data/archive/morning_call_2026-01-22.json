  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of multiple internet-facing platforms (Cisco Unified Comms, Fortinet SSO/FortiGate, Cloudflare WAF bypass, SmarterMail) increases risk of perimeter compromise and lateral movement into core networks.\n- New SaaS / Dev tools (GitLab, Zoom, Chainlit, Anthropic MCP, VS Code extensions) have exploitable or recently patched flaws that can bypass 2FA, execute code, or access cloud data, impacting developer and admin accounts.\n- Ransomware operators continue to refine tooling (LockBit 5.0, widespread abuse of EDR-kill tools) and initial access vectors (weaponized docs, LinkedIn phishing, Magecart), reinforcing need for stronger detection of pre-encryption activity.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cisco Unified Communications/Webex RCE zero‑day (CVE-2026-20045) – actively exploited**\n  - What happened: Cisco released fixes for an RCE in Unified CM and related products that was already exploited to gain root on appliances.\n  - Why it matters: Direct compromise of voice/comm appliances can provide internal foothold, credential theft, and lateral movement in our environment.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Identify all Cisco Unified CM/Webex UC assets; confirm patch/hotfix status today; review VPN/firewall logs for unusual access to these hosts and collect forensics if any anomalous admin or shell access is seen.\n\n- **Fortinet FortiGate/SSO vulnerability exploited in the wild (CVE-2025-59718 suspected)**\n  - What happened: Reports show FortiGate firewalls and Fortinet SSO components being compromised even when “fully patched,” linked to an auth/SSO flaw under active exploitation.\n  - Why it matters: Firewall compromise = network-wide pivoting, traffic inspection/manipulation, VPN credential theft; very high impact for financial networks.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Inventory all Fortinet devices, verify against latest Fortinet PSIRTs; restrict WAN exposure (mgmt interfaces, SSO portals), enable/verify MFA on VPN; urgently review logs for: new/unknown admins, config changes, suspicious VPN endpoints, and unexpected outbound connections from firewalls.\n\n- **GitLab 2FA bypass and account takeover**\n  - What happened: GitLab patched vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass 2FA and perform DoS; public write-ups available.\n  - Why it matters: Compromise of GitLab (self‑hosted or cloud) enables code tampering and CI/CD pipeline abuse, risking supply-chain style attacks on our apps and infra.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Confirm our GitLab instances (internal or SaaS) are on patched versions; check IdP and GitLab logs for abnormal logins, new PATs, new SSH keys, or 2FA resets in last 14–30 days; raise monitoring on privileged GitLab groups/projects.\n\n- **Cloud / AI tooling vulnerabilities (Anthropic MCP Git server, Chainlit, SmarterMail auth bypass)**\n  - What happened: Multiple bugs in Anthropic Git MCP server, Chainlit AI framework, and SmarterMail auth allow code execution, SSRF, file reads, and unauthorized access.\n  - Why it matters: These are often deployed in cloud or “lab” environments with over‑privileged roles; compromise can lead to direct access to cloud credentials, internal APIs, and sensitive datasets.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Identify any internal use of Anthropic MCP, Chainlit, SmarterMail; if present, enforce patching or immediate isolation; review cloud audit logs for these apps’ service accounts (unusual API calls, new keys/tokens, or cross‑region data access).\n\n- **Ransomware tradecraft evolution (EDR-kill tools, LockBit 5.0, active campaigns)**\n  - What happened: Research shows ransomware crews weaponizing >2,500 security tools to disable defenses pre‑encryption; LockBit 5.0’s new panel and variants documented; multiple large breaches (Ingram Micro, Luxshare, Everest group claims).\n  - Why it matters: Modern ransomware ops focus on stealthy defense evasion and data theft; financial orgs are key targets and may see similar TTPs.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Tighten monitoring for security tool tampering (EDR/WAF/AV services stopped, GPO/registry changes, uninstall events); ensure EDR self‑protection is enabled; confirm backups are recent, immutable, and tested; escalate any detection of bulk data staging or compression on servers.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Perimeter appliances (Cisco UC, Fortinet, SmarterMail) – initial access (T1190/T1133)**\n  - Log sources: Firewall logs, appliance syslog, NIDS; hunt for: new admin accounts, config changes from unusual IPs, logins from geo/IPs not seen before, CLI/SSH access spikes, unexpected outbound connections from these devices.\n\n- **Identity and SaaS (GitLab, Zoom, Cloudflare WAF, Microsoft Teams, IdP) – credential abuse (T1078, T1556)**\n  - Log sources: IdP, SSO, GitLab/Zoom audit logs, Cloudflare dashboard logs; hunt for: 2FA resets, new OAuth apps or PATs, changes to WAF rules, external domain anomalies in Teams or unusual external guest interactions.\n\n- **Cloud / AI frameworks (Anthropic MCP, Chainlit, training/demo envs) – SSRF, data access (T1190, T1195, T1041)**\n  - Log sources: Cloud provider audit (AWS/GCP/Azure), app logs, reverse proxies; look for: outbound requests from these apps to internal metadata services or databases, unusual file reads, or large data exports initiated by service accounts.\n\n- **Endpoint & server – EDR/WAF/AV tampering for ransomware prep (T1562, T1486)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, Linux auditd; monitor: service stop/uninstall events for security tools, registry/GPO changes affecting logging, process executions of common admin/forensic tools in atypical locations or by non-admin users.\n\n- **Phishing & malware delivery (Remcos RAT, LinkedIn lures, weaponized shipping docs, “contagious interview” VS Code) (T1566, T1204, T1059)**\n  - Log sources: Email gateway, EDR, proxy/DNS, M365/Google Workspace; hunt for: macro-enabled docs, ISO/ZIP attachments, VS Code workspace with auto‑task execution, connections to newly registered or LinkedIn-themed domains shortly after email or LinkedIn messages.\n\n- **Web & payment applications – Magecart-style JS skimming (T1059.007, T1530)**\n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs, file integrity monitoring (FIM), CDN; monitor: unauthorized changes to payment pages JS, unexpected external JS URLs, anomalies in checkout requests (extra beacons to third‑party domains).\n\n- **Linux endpoints and servers – AI-built malware (VoidLink), Snap store trojans, GNU InetUtils/NVIDIA Nsight RCEs (T1059, T1068)**\n  - Log sources: EDR for Linux, syslog, package manager logs; hunt for: suspicious new binaries in /tmp or user dirs, sudo/root shells from network services (telnetd/others tied to InetUtils), installation of unapproved Snap packages or Nsight use on servers.\n\n- **Developer & admin workstations – VS Code abuse, Git tooling (T1059, T1105, T1021)**\n  - Log sources: Endpoint logs, proxy, dev tool telemetry (if available); monitor: VS Code auto‑executed tasks on workspace open, scripts downloaded from external pastebins/Git repositories, SSH usage to new/unusual Git servers.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive perimeter review**\n  - Conduct a full inventory and risk assessment of all internet‑facing appliances (VPNs, UC, WAFs, SSO, mail gateways); ensure vendor notification subscriptions and tight maintenance/patching SLAs.\n\n- **Hardening of “lab”, training, and demo environments**\n  - Implement strict rules to avoid exposing security testing/training apps to the internet with production credentials; enforce separate accounts, networks, and delete/disable lab environments when not in use.\n\n- **Source code and CI/CD security uplift**\n  - Based on GitLab and MCP/Git findings, review access control, secrets management, branch protection, and code signing; consider mandatory SSO+FIDO2 for all dev platforms.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop and playbook refinement**\n  - Update incident response runbooks to include detection of EDR/WAF tampering and data theft prior to encryption; run at least one cross‑team exercise focusing on finance-sector ransomware intrusion paths.\n\n- **Browser, Oracle, Zoom, and Linux patch cycles**\n  - Ensure current cycles include: latest Chrome 144 V8 fix, Oracle Critical Patch Update, Zoom RCE patches, GNU InetUtils and NVIDIA Nsight updates; align with vulnerability management to prioritize internet-facing and high-privilege hosts.\n\n- **Enhanced phishing and social engineering awareness for high‑value users**\n  - Targeted training for finance, treasury, IT admins, and developers on current lures (shipping docs, LinkedIn job/interview invites, “help with a code task” VS Code scenarios, crypto theft on Linux) alongside technical controls (attachment sandboxing, tightened macro policies).",
