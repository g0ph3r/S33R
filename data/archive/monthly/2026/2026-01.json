    "title": "Securing the AI Pipeline – From Data to Deployment",
    "summary": "In our first post, we established why securing AI workloads is mission-critical for the enterprise . Now, we turn to the AI pipeline—the end-to-end journey from raw data to deployed models—and explore why every stage must be fortified against evolving threats. As organizations accelerate AI adoption, this pipeline becomes a prime target for adversaries seeking to poison data, compromise models, or exploit deployment endpoints. Enterprises don’t operate a single “AI system”; they run interconnected pipelines that transform data into decisions across a web of services, models, and applications. Protecting this chain demands a holistic security strategy anchored in Zero Trust for AI, supply chain integrity, and continuous monitoring. In this post, we map the pipeline, identify key attack vectors at each stage, and outline practical defenses using Microsoft’s security controls—spanning data governance with Purview, confidential training environments in Azure, and runtime threat detection with Defender for Cloud. Our guidance aligns with leading frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and MITRE ATLAS , ensuring your AI security program meets recognized standards while enabling innovation at scale. A Security View of the AI Pipeline Securing AI isn’t just about protecting a single model—it’s about safeguarding the entire pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable intelligence. This pipeline spans multiple stages, from data collection and preparation to model training, validation, and deployment, each introducing unique risks that adversaries can exploit. Data poisoning, model tampering, and supply chain attacks are no longer theoretical—they’re real threats that can undermine trust and compliance. By viewing the pipeline through a security lens, organizations can identify these vulnerabilities early and apply layered defenses such as Zero Trust principles, data lineage tracking, and runtime monitoring. This holistic approach ensures that AI systems remain resilient, auditable, and aligned with enterprise risk and regulatory requirements. Stages & Primary Risks Data Collection & Ingestion Sources: enterprise apps, data lakes, web, partners. Key risks: poisoning , PII leakage, weak lineage, and shadow datasets. Frameworks call for explicit governance and provenance at this earliest stage. [nist.gov] Data Prep & Feature Engineering Risks: backdoored features, bias injection, and transformation tampering that evades standard validation. ATLAS catalogs techniques that target data, features, and preprocessing. [atlas.mitre.org] Model Training / Fine‑Tuning Risks: model theft, inversion, poisoning, and compromised compute. Confidential computing and isolated training domains are recommended. [learn.microsoft.com] Validation & Red‑Team Testing Risks: tainted validation sets, overlooked LLM‑specific risks (prompt injection, unbounded consumption), and fairness drift. OWASP’s LLM Top 10 highlights the unique classes of generative threats. [owasp.org] Registry & Release Management Risks: supply chain tampering (malicious models, dependency confusion), unsigned artifacts, and missing SBOM/AIBOM. [codesecure.com] , [github.com] Deployment & Inference Risks: adversarial inputs, API abuse, prompt injection (direct & indirect), data exfiltration, and model abuse at runtime. Microsoft has documented multi‑layer mitigations and integrated threat protection for AI workloads. [techcommun…rosoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] Reference Architecture (Zero Trust for AI) The Reference Architecture for Zero Trust in AI establishes a security-first blueprint for the entire AI pipeline—from raw data ingestion to model deployment and continuous monitoring. Its importance lies in addressing the unique risks of AI systems, such as data poisoning, model tampering, and adversarial attacks, which traditional security models often overlook. By embedding Zero Trust principles at every stage—governance with Microsoft Purview, isolated training environments, signed model artifacts, and runtime threat detection—organizations gain verifiable integrity, regulatory compliance, and resilience against evolving threats. Adopting this architecture ensures that AI innovations remain trustworthy, auditable, and aligned with business and compliance objectives, ultimately accelerating adoption while reducing risk and safeguarding enterprise reputation. Below is a visual of what this architecture looks like: Figure 1: Reference Architecture Why this matters: Microsoft Purview establishes provenance, labels, and lineage Azure ML enforces network isolation Confidential Computing protects data-in-use Responsible AI tooling addresses safety & fairness Defender for Cloud adds runtime AI‑specific threat detection Azure ML Model Monitoring closes the loop with drift and anomaly detection. [microsoft.com] , [azure.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] Stage‑by‑Stage Threats & Concrete Mitigations (with Microsoft Controls) Data Collection & Ingestion - Attack Scenarios Data poisoning via partner feed or web‑scraped corpus; undetected changes skew downstream models. Research shows Differential Privacy (DP) can reduce impact but is not a silver bullet. Differential Privacy introduces controlled noise into training data or model outputs, making it harder for attackers to infer individual data points and limiting the influence of any single poisoned record. This helps reduce the impact of targeted poisoning attacks because malicious entries cannot disproportionately affect the model’s parameters. However, DP is not sufficient on its own for several reasons: Aggregate poisoning still works : DP protects individual records, but if an attacker injects a large volume of poisoned data, the cumulative effect can still skew the model. Utility trade-offs : Adding noise to achieve strong privacy guarantees often degrades model accuracy, creating tension between security and performance. Doesn’t detect malicious intent : DP doesn’t validate data quality or provenance—it only limits exposure. Poisoned data can still enter the pipeline undetected. Vulnerable to sophisticated attacks : Techniques like backdoor poisoning or gradient manipulation can bypass DP protections because they exploit model behavior rather than individual record influence. Bottom line, DP is a valuable layer for privacy and resilience, but it must be combined with data validation, anomaly detection, and provenance checks to effectively mitigate poisoning risks. [arxiv.org] , [dp-ml.github.io] Sensitive data drift into training corpus (PII/PHI), later leaking through model inversion. NIST RMF calls for privacy‑enhanced design and provenance from the outset. When personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) unintentionally enters the training dataset—often through partner feeds, logs, or web-scraped sources—it creates a latent risk. If the model memorizes these sensitive records, adversaries can exploit model inversion attacks to reconstruct or infer private details from outputs or embeddings. [nvlpubs.nist.gov] Mitigations & Integrations Classify & label sensitive fields with Microsoft Purview Use Purview’s automated scanning and classification to detect PII, PHI, financial data, and other regulated fields across your data estate. Apply sensitivity labels and tags to enforce consistent governance policies. [microsoft.com] Enable lineage across Microsoft Fabric/Synapse/SQL Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules to block unauthorized movement of sensitive data and prevent accidental leaks. Combine this with role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) to restrict who can view, modify, or export sensitive datasets. Integrate with SOC and DevSecOps Pipelines Feed Purview alerts and lineage events into your SIEM/XDR workflows for real-time monitoring. Automate policy enforcement in CI/CD pipelines to ensure models only train on approved, sanitized datasets. Continuous Compliance Monitoring Schedule recurring scans and leverage Purview’s compliance dashboards to validate adherence to regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST RMF. Maintain dataset hashes and signatures; store lineage metadata and approvals before a dataset can enter training (Purview + Fabric). [azure.microsoft.com] For externally sourced data, sandbox ingestion and run poisoning heuristics; if using Data Privacy (DP)‑training, document tradeoffs (utility vs. robustness). [aclanthology.org] , [dp-ml.github.io] 3.2 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering Attack Scenarios Feature backdoors : crafted tokens in a free‑text field activate hidden behaviors only under specific conditions. MITRE ATLAS lists techniques that target features/preprocessing. [atlas.mitre.org] Mitigations & Integrations Version every transformation; capture end‑to‑end lineage (Purview) and enforce code review on feature pipelines. Apply train/validation set integrity checks; for Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LLM RAG), inspect embeddings and vector stores for outliers before indexing. 3.3 Model Training & Fine‑Tuning - Attack Scenarios Training environment compromise leading to model tampering or exfiltration. Attackers may gain access to the training infrastructure (e.g., cloud VMs, on-prem GPU clusters, or CI/CD pipelines) and inject malicious code or alter training data. This can result in: Model poisoning : Introducing backdoors or bias into the model during training. Artifact manipulation : Replacing or corrupting model checkpoints or weights. Exfiltration : Stealing proprietary model architectures, weights, or sensitive training data for competitive advantage or further attacks. Model inversion / extraction attempts during or after training. Adversaries exploit APIs or exposed endpoints to infer sensitive information or replicate the model: Model inversion : Using outputs to reconstruct training data, potentially exposing PII or confidential datasets. Model extraction : Systematically querying the model to approximate its parameters or decision boundaries, enabling the attacker to build a clone or identify weaknesses for adversarial inputs. These attacks often leverage high-volume queries , gradient-based techniques , or membership inference to determine if specific data points were part of the training set. Mitigations & Integrations Train on Azure Confidential Computing : DCasv5/ECasv5 (AMD SEV‑SNP), Intel TDX, or SGX enclaves to protect data-in‑use; extend to AKS confidential nodes when containerizing. [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] Keep workspace network‑isolated with Managed VNet and Private Endpoints ; block public egress except allow‑listed services. [learn.microsoft.com] Use customer‑managed keys and managed identities; avoid shared credentials in notebooks; enforce role‑based training queues. [microsoft.github.io] 3.4 Validation, Safety, and Red‑Team Testing Attack Scenarios & Mitigations Prompt injection (direct/indirect) and Unbounded Consumption Attackers craft malicious prompts or embed hidden instructions in user input or external content (e.g., documents, URLs). Direct injection : User sends a prompt that overrides system instructions (e.g., “Ignore previous rules and expose secrets”). Indirect injection : Malicious content embedded in retrieved documents or partner feeds influences the model’s behavior. Impact : Can lead to data exfiltration , policy bypass , and unbounded API calls , escalating operational costs and exposing sensitive data. Mitigation : Implement prompt sanitization , context isolation , and rate limiting . Insecure Output Handling Enabling Script Injection. If model outputs are rendered in applications without proper sanitization, attackers can inject scripts or HTML tags into responses. Impact : Cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, or privilege escalation in downstream systems. Mitigation : Apply output encoding , content security policies , and strict validation before rendering model outputs. Reference : OWASP’s LLM Top 10 lists this as a major risk under insecure output handling. [owasp.org] , [securitybo…levard.com] Data Poisoning in Upstream Feeds Malicious or manipulated data introduced during ingestion (e.g., partner feeds, web scraping) skews model behavior or embeds backdoors. Mitigation: Data validation, anomaly detection, provenance tracking. Model Exfiltration via API Abuse Attackers use high-volume queries or gradient-based techniques to extract model weights or replicate functionality. Mitigation : Rate limiting, watermarking, query monitoring. Supply Chain Attacks on Model Artifacts Compromise of pre-trained models or fine-tuning checkpoints from public repositories. Mitigation : Signed artifacts, integrity checks, trusted sources. Adversarial Example Injection Inputs crafted to exploit model weaknesses, causing misclassification or unsafe outputs. Mitigation : Adversarial training, robust input validation. Sensitive Data Leakage via Model Inversion Attackers infer PII/PHI from model outputs or embeddings. Mitigation : Differential Privacy, access controls, privacy-enhanced design. Insecure Integration with External Tools LLMs calling plugins or APIs without proper sandboxing can lead to unauthorized actions. Mitigation : Strict permissioning, allowlists, and isolation. Additional Mitigations & Integrations considerations Adopt Microsoft’s defense‑in‑depth guidance for indirect prompt injection (hardening + Spotlighting patterns) and pair with runtime Prompt Shields . [techcommun…rosoft.com] Evaluate models with Responsible AI Dashboard (fairness, explainability, error analysis) and export RAI Scorecards for release gates. [learn.microsoft.com] Build security gates referencing MITRE ATLAS techniques and OWASP GenAI controls into your MLOps pipeline. [atlas.mitre.org] , [owasp.org] 3.5 Registry, Signing & Supply Chain Integrity - Attack Scenarios Model supply chain risk: backdoored pre‑trained weights Attackers compromise publicly available or third-party pre-trained models by embedding hidden behaviors (e.g., triggers that activate under specific inputs). Impact : Silent backdoors can cause targeted misclassification or data leakage during inference. Mitigation : Use trusted registries and verified sources for model downloads. Perform model scanning for anomalies and backdoor detection before deployment. [raykhira.com] Dependency Confusion Malicious actors publish packages with the same name as internal dependencies to public repositories. If build pipelines pull these packages, attackers gain code execution. Impact : Compromised training or deployment environments, leading to model tampering or data exfiltration. Mitigation : Enforce private package registries and pin versions . Validate dependencies against allowlists. Unsigned Artifacts Swapped in the Registry If model artifacts (weights, configs, containers) are not cryptographically signed, attackers can replace them with malicious versions. Impact: Deployment of compromised models or containers without detection. Mitigation: Implement artifact signing and integrity verification (e.g., SHA256 checksums). Require signature validation in CI/CD pipelines before promotion to production. Registry Compromise Attackers gain access to the model registry and alter metadata or inject malicious artifacts. Mitigation : RBAC, MFA, audit logging, and registry isolation. Tampered Build Pipeline CI/CD pipeline compromised to inject malicious code during model packaging or containerization. Mitigation : Secure build environments, signed commits, and pipeline integrity checks. Poisoned Container Images Malicious base images used for model deployment introduce vulnerabilities or malware. Mitigation : Use trusted container registries, scan images for CVEs, and enforce image signing. Shadow Artifacts Attackers upload artifacts with similar names or versions to confuse operators and bypass validation. Mitigation : Strict naming conventions, artifact fingerprinting, and automated validation. Additional Mitigations & Integrations considerations Store models in Azure ML Registry with version pinning; sign artifacts and publish SBOM / AI‑BOM metadata for downstream verifiers. [microsoft.github.io] , [github.com] , [codesecure.com] Maintain verifiable lineage and attestations (policy says: no signature, no deploy ). Emerging work on attestable pipelines reinforces this approach. [arxiv.org] 3.6 Secure Deployment & Runtime Protection - Attack Scenarios Adversarial inputs and prompt injections targeting your inference APIs or agents Attackers craft malicious queries or embed hidden instructions in user input or retrieved content to manipulate model behavior. Impact : Policy bypass, sensitive data leakage, or execution of unintended actions via connected tools. Mitigation : Prompt sanitization and isolation (strip unsafe instructions). Context segmentation for multi-turn conversations. Rate limiting and anomaly detection on inference endpoints. Jailbreaks that bypass safety filters Attackers exploit weaknesses in safety guardrails by chaining prompts or using obfuscation techniques to override restrictions. Impact : Generation of harmful, disallowed, or confidential content; reputational and compliance risks. Mitigation : Layered safety filters (input + output). Continuous red-teaming and adversarial testing. Dynamic policy enforcement based on risk scoring. API abuse and model extraction. High-volume or structured queries designed to infer model parameters or replicate its functionality. Impact : Intellectual property theft, exposure of proprietary model logic, and enabling downstream attacks. Mitigation : Rate limiting and throttling . Watermarking responses to detect stolen outputs. Query pattern monitoring for extraction attempts. [atlas.mitre.org] Insecure Integration with External Tools or Plugins LLM agents calling APIs without sandboxing can trigger unauthorized actions. Mitigation : Strict allowlists, permission gating, and isolated execution environments. Model Output Injection into Downstream Systems Unsanitized outputs rendered in apps or dashboards can lead to XSS or command injection. Mitigation : Output encoding, validation, and secure rendering practices. Runtime Environment Compromise Attackers exploit container or VM vulnerabilities hosting inference services. Mitigation : Harden runtime environments, apply OS-level security patches, and enforce network isolation. Side-Channel Attacks Observing timing, resource usage, or error messages to infer sensitive details about the model or data. Mitigation : Noise injection, uniform response timing, and error sanitization. Unbounded Consumption Leading to Cost Escalation Attackers flood inference endpoints with requests, driving up compute costs. Mitigation : Quotas, usage monitoring, and auto-scaling with cost controls. Additional Mitigations & Integrations considerations Deploy Managed Online Endpoints behind Private Link ; enforce mTLS, rate limits, and token‑based auth; restrict egress in managed VNet.

[learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] , [learn.microsoft.com] 3.7 Post‑Deployment Monitoring & Response - Attack Scenarios Data/Prediction Drift silently degrades performance Over time, input data distributions change (e.g., new slang, market shifts), causing the model to make less accurate predictions without obvious alerts. Impact : Reduced accuracy, operational risk, and potential compliance violations if decisions become unreliable. Mitigation : Continuous drift detection using statistical tests (KL divergence, PSI). Scheduled model retraining and validation pipelines. Alerting thresholds for performance degradation. Fairness Drift Shifts Outcomes Across Cohorts Model performance or decision bias changes for specific demographic or business segments due to evolving data or retraining. Impact : Regulatory risk (GDPR, EEOC), reputational damage, and ethical concerns. Mitigation : Implement bias monitoring dashboards . Apply fairness metrics (equal opportunity, demographic parity) in post-deployment checks. Trigger remediation workflows when drift exceeds thresholds. Emergent Jailbreak Patterns evolve over time Attackers discover new prompt injection or jailbreak techniques that bypass safety filters after deployment. Impact : Generation of harmful or disallowed content, policy violations, and security breaches. Mitigation : Behavioral anomaly detection on prompts and outputs. Continuous red-teaming and adversarial testing . Dynamic policy updates integrated into inference pipelines. Shadow Model Deployment Unauthorized or outdated models running in production environments without governance. Mitigation : Registry enforcement, signed artifacts, and deployment audits. Silent Backdoor Activation Backdoors introduced during training activate under rare conditions post-deployment. Mitigation : Runtime scanning for anomalous triggers and adversarial input detection. Telemetry Tampering Attackers manipulate monitoring logs or metrics to hide drift or anomalies. Mitigation : Immutable logging, cryptographic integrity checks, and SIEM integration. Cost Abuse via Automated Bots Bots continuously hit inference endpoints, driving up operational costs unnoticed. Mitigation : Rate limiting, usage analytics, and anomaly-based throttling. Model Extraction Over Time Slow, distributed queries across months to replicate model behavior without triggering rate limits. Mitigation : Long-term query pattern analysis and watermarking.

[learn.microsoft.com] , [azure.microsoft.com] Closing As your organization scales AI, the pipeline is the perimeter. Treat every stage—from data capture to model deployment—as a control point with verifiable lineage, signed artifacts, network isolation, runtime detection, and continuous risk measurement. But securing the pipeline is only part of the story—what about the models themselves? In our next post, we’ll dive into hardening AI models against adversarial attacks, exploring techniques to detect, mitigate, and build resilience against threats that target the very core of your AI systems. Key Takeaway Securing AI requires protecting the entire pipeline—from data collection to deployment and monitoring—not just individual models. Zero Trust for AI: Embed security controls at every stage (data governance, isolated training, signed artifacts, runtime threat detection) for integrity and compliance. Main threats and mitigations by stage: Data Collection: Risks include poisoning and PII leakage; mitigate with data classification, lineage tracking, and DLP. Data Preparation: Watch for feature backdoors and tampering; use versioning, code review, and integrity checks. Model Training: Risks are environment compromise and model theft; mitigate with confidential computing, network isolation, and managed identities. Validation & Red Teaming: Prompt injection and unbounded consumption are key risks; address with prompt sanitization, output encoding, and adversarial testing. Supply Chain & Registry: Backdoored models and dependency confusion; use trusted registries, artifact signing, and strict pipeline controls. Deployment & Runtime: Adversarial inputs and API abuse; mitigate with rate limiting, context segmentation, and Defender for Cloud AI threat protection. Monitoring: Watch for data/prediction drift and cost abuse; enable continuous monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining.

    "title": "Microsoft Purview Data Governance - Authoring Custom Data Quality rules using expression languages",
    "summary": "The cost of poor-quality data runs into millions of dollars in direct losses. When indirect costs—such as missed opportunities—are included, the total impact is many times higher. Poor data quality also creates significant societal costs. It can lead customers to pay higher prices for goods and services and force citizens to bear higher taxes due to inefficiencies and errors. In critical domains, the consequences can be severe. Defective or inaccurate data can result in injury or loss of life, for example due to medication errors or incorrect medical procedures, especially as healthcare increasingly relies on data- and AI-driven decision-making. Students may be unfairly denied admission to universities because of errors in entrance exam scoring. Consumers may purchase unsafe or harmful food products if nutritional labels are inaccurate or misleading. Research and industry measurements show that 20–35 percent of an organization’s operating revenue is often wasted on recovering from process failures, data defects, information scrap, and rework caused by poor data quality ( Larry P. English, Information Quality Applied ). Figure 1: Data quality rules Data Quality Rules To maintain high-quality data, organizations must continuously measure and monitor data quality and understand the negative impact of poor-quality data on their specific use cases. Data quality rules play a critical role in objectively measuring, enforcing, and quantifying data quality, enabling organizations to improve trust, reduce risk, and maximize the value of their data assets. Data Quality (DQ) rules define how data should be structured, related, constrained, and validated so it can be trusted for operational, analytical, and AI use cases. Data quality rules are essential guidelines that organizations establish to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of their data. These rules fall into four major categories: Business Entity rules, Business Attribute rules, Data Dependency rules, and Data Validity rules (R ef: Informit.com/articles ). Business Entity Rules These rules ensure that core business objects (such as Customer, Order, Account, or Product) are well-defined and correctly related. Business entity rules prevent duplicate records, broken relationships, and incomplete business processes. Business Entity Rules Definition Example Uniqueness Every entity instance must be uniquely identifiable. Each customer must have a unique Customer ID that is never NULL. Duplicate customer records indicate poor data quality. Cardinality Defines how many instances of one entity can relate to another. One customer can place many orders (one-to-many), but an order belongs to exactly one customer. Optionality Defines whether a relationship is mandatory or optional. An order must be linked to a customer (mandatory), but a customer may exist without having placed any orders (optional). Business Attribute Rules These rules focus on individual data elements (columns/fields) within business entities. Attribute rules ensure consistency, interpretability, and prevent invalid or meaningless values. Business Attribute Rules Definition Example Data Inheritance Attributes defined in a supertype must be consistent across subtypes. An Account Number remains the same whether the account is Checking or Savings. Data Domains Attribute values must conform to allowed formats or ranges. · State Code must be one of the 50 U.S. state abbreviations · Age must be between 0 and 120 · Date must follow CCYY/MM/DD format Data Dependency Rules These rules define logical and conditional relationships between entities and attributes. Data dependency rules enforce business logic and prevent contradictory or illogical data states. Data Dependency Rules Definition Example Entity Relationship Dependency The existence of one relationship depends on another condition. Orders cannot be placed for customers with a “Delinquent” status. Attribute Dependency The value of one attribute depends on others. · If Loan Status = “Funded,” then Loan Amount > 0 and Funding Date is required · Pay Amount = Hours Worked × Hourly Rate · If Monthly Salary > 0, then Commission Rate must be NULL Data Validity Rules These rules ensure that actual data values are complete, correct, accurate, precise, unique, and consistent. Validity rules ensure data is trustworthy for reporting, regulatory compliance, and AI/ML models. Data Validity Rules Definition Example Completeness Required records, relationships, attributes, and values must exist. No NULLs in mandatory fields like Customer ID or Order Date. Correctness & Accuracy Values must reflect real-world truth and business rules. A customer’s credit limit must align with approved financial records. Precision Data must be stored with the required level of detail. Interest rates stored to four decimal places if required for calculations. Uniqueness No duplicate records, keys, definitions, or overloaded columns. A “Customer Type Code” column should not mix customer types and shipping methods. Consistency Duplicate or redundant data must match everywhere it appears. Customer address stored in multiple systems must be identical. Compliance PII and sensitive data Check and validate personal information like credit card, passport number, national id, bank account, etc. System Rules Microsoft Purview Data Quality provides both system (out-of-the-box) rules and custom rules, along with an AI-enabled data quality rule recommendation feature. Together, these capabilities help organizations effectively measure, monitor, and improve data quality by applying the right set of data quality rules. System (out-of-the-box) rules cover the majority of business attribute and data validity scenarios. List of the system rules are illustrated below (see the screenshot below). Figure 2: System rules Custom Rules Custom rules allow you to define validations that evaluate one or more values within a row, enabling complex, context-aware data quality checks tailored to specific business requirements. Custom rules support all four major categories of data quality rules: Business Entity rules, Business Attribute rules, Data Dependency rules, and Data Validity rules. You can use regular expression language , Azure Data Factory expression , and SQL expression language to create custom rules. Purview Data Quality custom rule has three parts: Row expression : This Boolean expression applies to each row that the filter expression approves. If this expression returns true, the row passes. If it returns false, the row fails. Filter expression : This optional condition narrows down the dataset on which the row condition is evaluated. You activate it by selecting the Use filter expression checkbox. This expression returns a Boolean value. The filter expression applies to a row and if it returns true, then that row is considered for the rule. If the filter expression returns false for that row, then it means that row is ignored for the purposes of this rule. The default behavior of the filter expression is to pass all rows, so if you don't specify a filter expression, all rows are considered. Null expression : Checks how NULL values should be handled. This expression returns to a Boolean that handles cases where data is missing. If the expression returns true, the row expression isn't applied. Each part of the rule works similarly to existing Microsoft Purview Data Quality conditions. A rule only passes if the row expression evaluates to TRUE for the dataset that matches the filter expression and handles missing values as specified in the null expression. Examples: Ensure that the location of the salesperson is correct. Azure data factory expression language is used to author this rule. Figure 3: Ensuring location is correct 2. Ensure \"fare Amount\" is positive and \"trip Distance\" is valid. SQL expression language is used to author this rule. Figure 4: Ensuring fare SQL expression is correct 3. For each trip, check if the fare is above the average for its payment type. SQL expression language is used to author this rule. Figure 5: Ensure fare correctness Together, above listed four categories of data quality rules: Prevent errors at the source Enforce business logic Improve trust in analytics and AI Reduce remediation costs downstream Figure 6: Data quality rules In short, high-quality data is not accidental—it is enforced through well-defined data quality rules across entities, attributes, relationships, and values.

    "title": "Microsoft Defender Experts Disrupt Jasper Sleet’s Insider Access Campaign",
    "summary": "By: Mukta Agarwal and Parth Jamodkar Threat actors are increasingly infiltrating organizations by securing legitimate jobs, often through falsified credentials or insider recruitment. Recently, Microsoft Defender Experts, powered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, successfully thwarted a sophisticated campaign by Jasper Sleet (formerly Storm-0287), a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor known for stealthy infiltration tactics. Rather than compromising victims directly, these actors pose as job applicants or contractors, infiltrating organizations to gain long-term insider access under false identities. Organizations in the information technology segment throughout the United States have been the primary targets for Jasper Sleet. However, as this threat actor has grown more sophisticated and expanded their reach, other industries including consumer retail, healthcare, financial services, critical manufacturing, and energy across different regions have also become targets. The challenge Jasper Sleet leveraged social engineering and identity fraud to bypass traditional security controls. By impersonating remote IT contractors, the actors blend into legitimate workflows, using shared devices for MFA and VPN services to mask their origin. These tactics enabled persistence through long-lived sessions and authentication tokens, creating a high risk of privilege abuse and data exfiltration if left undetected. Indicators observed during investigation Shared devices for MFA: During authentication analysis, it was observed that a single device was repeatedly used to complete multifactor authentication (MFA) for multiple user accounts within the same tenant. MFA is intended to enforce strong identity assurance by binding authentication to a unique user-device pairing. When this control is circumvented, it raises a security concern. Further investigation revealed consistent technical signals across these events, including identical session identifiers, common ISP, and geolocation. Such behavior is strongly indicative of fraudulent personas operating from shared workstations, pooled environments such as Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), or compromised devices. Suspicious login patterns: Initial access attempts originated from US or Western IP addresses to simulate remote work, followed by logins from Russian, Chinese, or other Asian IPs and often linked to VPN services such as Astrill. Certain sessions exhibited AVD-like login patterns originating from Russian-based instances. Session persistence: Long-lived authentication sessions, (such as non-password based) cookies and tokens allow malicious insiders to maintain access even after password resets, as these tokens often remain valid without re-authentication. Together, these behaviors pointed to a stealthy, long-term operation designed to blend in with legitimate activity and maintain persistent access through pre-existing privileges associated with IT roles. Behavioral indicators mappings Defender Experts response Defender Experts took a proactive approach by meticulously analyzing the suspicious behavioral patterns and successfully uncovering multiple customers who had been impacted by the Jasper Sleet campaign. Upon identification, we immediately reached out to the affected organizations through managed response and Defender Expert Notifications, ensuring they were promptly informed about the threat and the necessary actions to be taken. Recognizing the potential for broader impact, we also issued proactive threat advisories to all Defender Experts customers. We actively engaged with the customers, initiating collaborative sessions to validate the attack vectors, discuss findings, and the recommended steps. This open channel of communication fostered a collective defense posture, where shared intelligence and real-time feedback between Defender Experts and customer teams amplified the speed and effectiveness of the response. Actions included: Immediate alerts to affected organizations via Defender Experts Notifications titled “Microsoft Defender Experts: Potential malicious activity linked to threat actor observed in your environment ”, which included observed indicators and recommendations. Proactive threat advisories to all Defender Experts customers (subject- Microsoft Defender Experts Threat Advisory: Jasper Sleet ), informing them of key adversarial tactics, impact, and encouraging them to remain vigilant and review their own environments for similar indicators of compromise. Direct collaboration with customers to facilitate joint sessions aimed at validating attack vectors and discussing findings. Outcome and impact The coordinated and transparent partnership between Defender Experts and our customers played a critical role in containing the threat before it could escalate. Customers responded promptly by disabling compromised contract employee accounts, effectively mitigating the risk of further misuse. Through these actions, customers addressed immediate risks and strengthened their long-term security posture by implementing best practices and incorporating lessons learned from the incident. This case highlights the significant value of robust collaboration between Defender Experts and customers in countering sophisticated, targeted cyber-attacks, demonstrating that collective efforts enhance the ability to defend against evolving threats. Together, we are stronger and more capable of defending against evolving threats. Customers reported that timely alerts and expert guidance prevented downstream compromise and strengthened their security posture. Some of the testimonials from the customers: “ A big thank you to the Microsoft team for all their efforts and coordination in detecting this, which has been immensely helpful.” “Appreciate Defender Experts for finding this.

    "title": "Pluralistic: Code is a liability (not an asset) (06 Jan 2026)",
    "summary": "Today's links Code is a liability (not an asset): AI psychosis, tech boss edition. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Coldplay CD DRM; Star Wars Wars; Digital manorialism vs neofeudalism; Transvaginal foetal sonic bombardment: woo-tunes for your hoo-hah. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Code is a liability (not an asset) (permalink) Code is a liability (not an asset). Tech bosses don't understand this. They think AI is great because it produces 10,000 times more code than a programmer, but that just means it's producing 10,000 times more liabilities. AI is the asbestos we're shoveling into the walls of our high-tech society: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence Code is a liability. Code's capabilities are assets. The goal of a tech shop is to have code whose capabilities generate more revenue than the costs associated with keeping that code running. For a long time, firms have nurtured a false belief that code costs less to run over time: after an initial shakedown period in which the bugs in the code are found and addressed, code ceases to need meaningful maintenance. After all, code is a machine without moving parts – it does not wear out; it doesn't even wear down. This is the thesis of Paul Mason's 2015 book Postcapitalism, a book that has aged remarkably poorly (though not, perhaps, as poorly as Mason's own political credibility): code is not an infinitely reproducible machine that requires no labor inputs to operate. Rather, it is a brittle machine that requires increasingly heroic measures to keep it in good working order, and which eventually does \"wear out\" (in the sense of needing a top-to-bottom refactoring). To understand why code is a liability, you have to understand the difference between \"writing code\" and \"software engineering.\" \"Writing code\" is an incredibly useful, fun, and engrossing pastime. It involves breaking down complex tasks into discrete steps that are so precisely described that a computer can reliably perform them, and optimising that performance by finding clever ways of minimizing the demands the code puts on the computer's resources, such as RAM and processor cycles. Meanwhile, \"software engineering\" is a discipline that subsumes \"writing code,\" but with a focus on the long-term operations of the system the code is part of. Software engineering concerns itself with the upstream processes that generate the data the system receives. It concerns itself with the downstream processes that the system emits processed information to. It concerns itself with the adjacent systems that are receiving data from the same upstream processes and/or emitting data to the same downstream processes the system is emitting to. \"Writing code\" is about making code that runs well. \"Software engineering\" is about making code that fails well. It's about making code that is legible – whose functions can be understood by third parties who might be asked to maintain it, or might be asked to adapt the processes downstream, upstream or adjacent to the system to keep the system from breaking. It's about making code that can be adapted, for example, when the underlying computer architecture it runs on is retired and has to be replaced, either with a new kind of computer, or with an emulated version of the old computer: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/hpux_end_of_life/ Because that's the thing: any nontrivial code has to interact with the outside world, and the outside world isn't static, it's dynamic. The outside world busts through the assumptions made by software authors all the time and every time it does, the software needs to be fixed. Remember Y2K? That was a day when perfectly functional code, running on perfectly functional hardware, would stop functioning – not because the code changed, but because time marched on. We're 12 years away from the Y2038 problem, when 32-bit flavors of Unix will all cease to work, because they, too, will have run out of computable seconds. These computers haven't changed, their software hasn't changed, but the world – by dint of ticking over, a second at a time, for 68 years – will wear through their seams, and they will rupture: https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/23/the_unix_epochalypse_might_be/ The existence of \"the world\" is an inescapable factor that wears out software and requires it to be rebuilt, often at enormous expense. The longer code is in operation, the more likely it is that it will encounter \"the world.\" Take the code that devices use to report on their physical location. Originally, this was used for things like billing – determining which carrier or provider's network you were using and whether you were roaming. Then, our mobile devices used this code to help determine your location in order to give you turn-by-turn directions in navigation apps. Then, this code was repurposed again to help us find our lost devices. This, in turn, became a way to locate stolen devices, a use-case that sharply diverges from finding lost devices in important ways – for example, when locating a lost device, you don't have to contend with the possibility that a malicious actor has disabled the \"find my lost device\" facility. These additional use cases – upstream, downstream and adjacent – exposed bugs in the original code that never surfaced in the earlier applications. For example, all location services must have some kind of default behavior in the (very common) event that they're not really sure where they are. Maybe they have a general fix – for example, they know which cellular mast they're connected to, or they know where they were the last time they got an accurate location fix – or maybe they're totally lost. It turns out that in many cases, location apps drew a circle around all the places they could be and then set their location to the middle of that circle. That's fine if the circle is only a few feet in diameter, or if the app quickly replaces this approximation with a more precise location. But what if the location is miles and miles across, and the location fix never improves? What if the location for any IP address without a defined location is given as the center of the continental USA and any app that doesn't know where it is reports that it is in a house in Kansas, sending dozens of furious (occasionally armed) strangers to that house, insisting that the owners are in possession of their stolen phones and tablets? https://theweek.com/articles/624040/how-internet-mapping-glitch-turned-kansas-farm-into-digital-hell You don't just have to fix this bug once – you have to fix it over and over again. In Georgia: https://www.jezebel.com/why-lost-phones-keep-pointing-at-this-atlanta-couples-h-1793854491 In Texas: https://abc7chicago.com/post/find-my-iphone-apple-error-strangers-at-texas-familys-home-scott-schuster/13096627/ And in my town of Burbank, where Google's location-sharing service once told us that our then-11-year-old daughter (whose phone we couldn't reach) was 12 miles away, on a freeway ramp in an unincorporated area of LA county (she was at a nearby park, but out of range, and the app estimated her location as the center of the region it has last fixed her in) (it was a rough couple hours). The underlying code – the code that uses some once-harmless default to fudge unknown locations – needs to be updated constantly, because the upstream, downstream and adjacent processes connected to it are changing constantly. The longer that code sits there, the more superannuated its original behaviors become, and the more baroque, crufty and obfuscated the patches layered atop of it become. Code is not an asset – it's a liability. The longer a computer system has been running, the more tech debt it represents. The more important the system is, the harder it is to bring down and completely redo. Instead, new layers of code are slathered atop of it, and wherever the layers of code meet, there are fissures in which these systems behave in ways that don't exactly match up. Worse still: when two companies are merged, their seamed, fissured IT systems are smashed together, so that now there are adjacent sources of tech debt, as well as upstream and downstream cracks: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/28/dealer-management-software/#antonin-scalia-stole-your-car That's why giant companies are so susceptible to ransomware attacks – they're full of incompatible systems that have been coaxed into a facsimile of compatibility with various forms of digital silly putty, string and baling wire. They are not watertight and they cannot be made watertight. Even if they're not taken down by hackers, they sometimes just fall over and can't be stood back up again – like when Southwest Airlines' computers crashed for all of Christmas week 2022, stranding millions of travelers: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/16/for-petes-sake/#unfair-and-deceptive Airlines are especially bad, because they computerized early, and can't ever shut down the old computers to replace them with new ones. This is why their apps are such dogshit – and why it's so awful that they've fired their customer service personnel and require fliers to use the apps for everything, even though the apps do. not. work. These apps won't ever work. The reason that British Airways' app displays \"An unknown error has occurred\" 40-80% of the time isn't (just) that they fired all their IT staff and outsourced to low bidders overseas. It's that, sure – but also that BA's first computers ran on electromechanical valves, and everything since has to be backwards-compatible with a system that one of Alan Turing's proteges gnawed out of a whole log with his very own front teeth. Code is a liability, not an asset (BA's new app is years behind schedule). Code is a liability. The servers for the Bloomberg terminals that turned Michael Bloomberg into a billionaire run on RISC chips, meaning that the company is locked into using a dwindling number of specialist hardware and data-center vendors, paying specialized programmers, and building brittle chains of code to connect these RISC systems to their less exotic equivalents in the world. Code isn't an asset. AI can write code, but AI can't do software engineering. Software engineering is all about thinking through context – what will come before this system? What will come after it? What will sit alongside of it? How will the world change? Software engineering requires a very wide \"context window,\" the thing that AI does not, and cannot have. AI has a very narrow and shallow context window, and linear expansions to AI's context window requires geometric expansions in the amount of computational resources the AI consumes: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda Writing code that works, without consideration of how it will fail, is a recipe for catastrophe. It is a way to create tech debt at scale. It is shoveling asbestos into the walls of our technological society. Bosses do not know that code is a liability, not an asset. That's why they won't shut the fuck up about the chatbots that shit out 10,000 times more code than any human programmer. They think they've found a machine that produces assets at 10,000 times the rate of a human programmer. They haven't. They've found a machine that produces liability at 10,000 times the rate of any human programmer. Maintainability isn't just a matter of hard-won experience teaching you where the pitfalls are. It also requires the cultivation of \"Fingerspitzengefühl\" – the \"fingertip feeling\" that lets you make reasonable guesses about where never before seen pitfalls might emerge. It's a form of process knowledge. It is ineluctable. It is not latent in even the largest corpus of code that you could use as training data: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Boy do tech bosses not get this. Take Microsoft. Their big bet right now is on \"agentic AI.\" They think that if they install spyware on your computer that captures every keystroke, every communication, every screen you see and sends it to Microsoft's cloud and give a menagerie of chatbots access to it, that you'll be able to tell your computer, \"Book me a train to Cardiff and find that hotel Cory mentioned last year and book me a room there\" and it will do it. This is an incredibly unworkable idea. No chatbot is remotely capable of doing all these things, something that Microsoft freely stipulates. Rather than doing this with one chatbot, Microsoft proposes to break this down among dozens of chatbots, each of which Microsoft hopes to bring up to 95% reliability. That's an utterly implausible chatbot standard in and of itself, but consider this: probabilities are multiplicative. A system containing two processes that operate at 95% reliability has a net reliability of 90.25% (0.95 * 0.95). Break a task down among a couple dozen 95% accurate bots and the chance that this task will be accomplished correctly rounds to zero. Worse, Microsoft is on record as saying that they will grant the Trump administration secret access to all the data in its cloud: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/07/22/microsoft-cant-keep-eu-data-safe-from-us-authorities/ So – as Signal's Meredith Whittaker and Udbhav Tiwari put it in their incredible 39C3 talk last week in Hamburg – Microsoft is about to abolish the very idea of privacy for any data on personal and corporate computers, in order to ship AI agents that cannot ever work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Meanwhile, a Microsoft exec got into trouble last December when he posted to Linkedin announcing his intention to have AI rewrite all of Microsoft's code. Refactoring Microsoft's codebase makes lots of sense. Microsoft – like British Airways and other legacy firms – has lots of very old code that represents unsustainable tech debt. But using AI to rewrite that code is a way to start with tech debt that will only accumulate as time goes by: https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/microsoft-denies-rewriting-windows-11-using-ai-after-an-employees-one-engineer-one-month-one-million-code-post-on-linkedin-causes-outrage/ Now, some of you reading this have heard software engineers extolling the incredible value of using a chatbot to write code for them. Some of you are software engineers who have found chatbots incredibly useful in writing code for you. This is a common AI paradox: why do some people who use AI find it really helpful, while others loathe it? Is it that the people who don't like AI are \"bad at AI?\" Is it that the AI fans are lazy and don't care about the quality of their work? There's doubtless some of both going on, but even if you teach everyone to be an AI expert, and cull everyone who doesn't take pride in their work out of the sample, the paradox will still remain. The true solution to the AI paradox lies in automation theory, and the concept of \"centaurs\" and \"reverse centaurs\": https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/11/vulgar-thatcherism/#there-is-an-alternative In automation theory, a \"centaur\" is a person who is assisted by a machine. A \"reverse centaur\" is someone who has been conscripted into assisting a machine. If you're a software engineer who uses AI to write routine code that you have the time and experience to validate, deploying your Fingerspitzengefühl and process knowledge to ensure that it's fit for purpose, it's easy to see why you might find using AI (when you choose to, in ways you choose to, at a pace you choose to go at) to be useful. But if you're a software engineer who's been ordered to produce code at 10x, or 100x, or 10,000x your previous rate, and the only way to do that is via AI, and there is no human way that you could possibly review that code and ensure that it will not break on first contact with the world, you'll hate it (you'll hate it even more if you've been turned into the AI's accountability sink, personally on the hook for the AI's mistakes): https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war There's another way in which software engineers find AI-generated code to be incredibly helpful: when that code is isolated. If you're doing a single project – say, converting one batch of files to another format, just once – you don't have to worry about downstream, upstream or adjacent processes. There aren't any. You're writing code to do something once, without interacting with any other systems. A lot of coding is this kind of utility project. It's tedious, thankless, and ripe for automation. Lots of personal projects fall into this bucket, and of course, by definition, a personal project is a centaur project. No one forces you to use AI in a personal project – it's always your choice how and when you make personal use of any tool. But the fact that software engineers can sometimes make their work better with AI doesn't invalidate the fact that code is a liability, not an asset, and that AI code represents liability production at scale. In the story of technological unemployment, there's the idea that new technology creates new jobs even as it makes old ones obsolete: for every blacksmith put out of work by the automobile, there's a job waiting as a mechanic. In the years since the AI bubble began inflating, we've heard lots of versions of this: AI would create jobs for \"prompt engineers\" – or even create jobs that we can't imagine, because they won't exist until AI has changed the world beyond recognition. I wouldn't bank on getting work in a fanciful trade that literally can't be imagined because our consciousnesses haven't so altered by AI that they've acquired the capacity to conceptualize of these new modes of work. But if you are looking for a job that AI will definitely create, by the millions, I have a suggestion: digital asbestos removal. For if AI code – written at 10,000 times the speed of any human coder, designed to work well, but not to fail gracefully – is the digital asbestos we're filling our walls with, then our descendants will spend generations digging that asbestos out of the walls. There will be plenty of work fixing the things that we broke thanks to the most dangerous AI psychosis of all – the hallucinatory belief that \"writing code\" is the same thing as \"software engineering.\" At the rate we're going, we'll have full employment for generations of asbestos removers.

    "title": "Micropatches Released for Credential Security Support Provider Protocol (CredSSP) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2025-47987)",
    "summary": "July 2025 Windows Updates brought a patch for CVE-2025-47987 , a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Credential Security Support Provider that could allow a local low-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as Local System user. The vulnerability was discovered and reported to Microsoft by Erik Egsgard with Field Effect . Subsequently, security researcher Kryptoenix reverse-engineered Microsoft's patch and published a detailed analysis of this vulnerability and shared a proof-of-concept . The Vulnerability The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs because of a numeric overflow when length of user-supplied data is calculated. The numeric overflow leads to the result being a small number, so the allocated buffer for the user-supplied data ends up being too small for the data. When the data is copied to the buffer, adjacent memory blocks on the heap are overwritten, which in the case of the proof-of-concept (POC) results in memory corruption and crashing of lsass.exe , but a carefully crafted data block could lead to arbitrary code execution as Local System. Microsoft's Patch Microsoft's patch replaced the unsafe addition operation with a call to a safe addition function that detects an overflow and terminates the processing of such user-supplied data. Our Patch Our patch is logically identical to Microsoft's. Let's see our patch in action. First, a low-privileged user launches the POC while 0patch is disabled, which results in crashing lsass.exe . With 0patch enabled, the POC fails to crash lsass.exe (although it reports success). Micropatch Availability Micropatches were written for the following security-adopted Windows versions: Windows 11 v21H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v21H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v21H1 - fully updated Windows 10 v20H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v2004 - fully updated Windows 10 v1909 - fully updated Windows 10 v1809 - fully updated Windows 10 v1803 - fully updated Windows 7 - fully updated with no ESU, ESU 1, ESU 2 or ESU 3 Windows Server 2008 R2 - fully updated with no ESU, ESU 1, ESU 2, ESU 3 or ESU 4 Windows Server 2012 - fully updated with no ESU or ESU 1 Windows Server 2012 R2 - fully updated with no ESU or ESU 1 Micropatches have already been distributed to, and applied on, all affected online computers with 0patch Agent in PRO or Enterprise accounts (unless Enterprise group settings prevented that). Vulnerabilities like these get discovered on a regular basis, and attackers know about them all. If you're using Windows that aren't receiving official security updates anymore, 0patch will make sure these vulnerabilities won't be exploited on your computers - and you won't even have to know or care about these things. We'd like to thank Erik Egsgard with Field Effect for discovering this vulnerability, and Kryptoenix for analyzing it and publishing their analysis and proof-of-concept, which allowed us to create a patch and protect 0patch users against this issue. If you're new to 0patch , create a free account in 0patch Central , start a free trial, then install and register 0patch Agent. Everything else will happen automatically. No computer reboot will be needed. Did you know 0patch security-adopted Windows 10 and Office 2016 and 2019 when they went out of support this month, allowing you to keep using them for at least 3 more years (5 years for Windows 10)?

    "title": "The New Chapter of Egress Communication with Cobalt Strike User-Defined C2",
    "summary": "Introduction For years, External C2 has been regarded as one of the most effective ways to bypass EDR and XDR solutions thanks to its ability to support custom-built egress channels. It allows red teams to design their own communication mechanisms, avoiding the static signatures that defenders traditionally monitor and detect. However, several limitations became apparent as External C2 matured: User-Defined C2: The New External C2 User-Defined C2 (UDC2) was introduced as the evolution of External C2, specifically designed to address many of these shortcomings. UDC2 is significantly lighter and only requires the development of a Beacon Object File (BOF) rather than a full standalone client. The new workflow can be summarized as follows: Beacon leverages the UDC2 BOF to transmit encrypted frames over the custom C2 channel implemented in the BOF. Using your C2 protocol, the BOF communicates frame data with the UDC2 server, which relays it to the UDC2 listener on your Cobalt Strike team server via a direct TCP link. The following image describes the architecture difference between User-Defined and External C2: As illustrated in the diagram, while from a development perspective the attacker infrastructure remains (almost) the same, the difference is in the client itself. Previously with External C2, the whole client must be developed. Meaning that the client will request the SMB beacon, inject it in the client itself and communicate with it through named pipe to relay the beacon task and later parse its output before sending it back to the Teamserver via the egress channel. With UDC2, only the BOF is required to develop, which will proxy the beacon functions, so its traffic gets redirected to the custom communication channel. Since the Beacon remains untouched, we can make use of Artifact Kit, Sleep Mask, UDRL and all the other evasion features Cobalt Strike offers. User-Defined C2: The Advantages With UDC2: However, the primary limitation is that development is constrained to C, since Beacon Object Files (BOFs) must be written in C. The additional BOF can also have evasive characteristics, particularly when leveraging APIs or libraries associated with commonly used services such as Slack, Microsoft platforms, AWS, Mattermost, Discord, etc. When aligned with legitimate tools and communication patterns already present in the target environment, the BOF’s traffic is more likely to blend in. However, extended or high-volume tasking – such as relaying large amounts of traffic – may generate abnormal spikes (for example, an unusually high rate of Slack messages per minute), which could appear suspicious to monitoring solutions or EDR platforms. Increasing Beacon sleep intervals can help reduce this visibility, though this approach may be less suitable for proxychains traffic, where speed is required to avoid connection timeout. Demo: Slack Egress Channel Since Fortra has open sourced a project demonstrating UDC2 via ICMP echo requests and replies, we decided to experiment with the new capability – this time using Slack instead. To achieve this, we set up a Slack workspace and created a bot with permissions to send and read messages. Our design uses two separate channels: one for client-to-server communication and another for server-to-client responses. This separation helps prevent any potential communication collisions. The initial development of the Slack transport began with a simple goal: leverage the WinInet API to perform HTTPS POST and GET requests against the Slack Web API. In the early “Proof of Concept” phase, the logic was simple—data was formatted using standard library functions like sprintf, and buffers were declared as fixed-size arrays on the stack (e.g., char response[8192]). While this worked in a standard executable environment, it was fundamentally incompatible with the constraints of a Beacon Object File (BOF). To solve this, we had to systematically “de-stack” the entire implementation. Every large buffer—the raw HTTP response, the extracted JSON value from Slack API, and the intermediate Base64 decoded binary—was migrated to the process heap. The official’s example has already implemented a safeHeapAlloc wrapper around Kernel32$HeapAlloc. Instead of: char resp[16384]; // Triggers __chkstkWe moved to: void* respPtr = NULL; safeHeapAlloc(&respPtr, 16384); // BOF compatible The same logic must be applied for data send logic. From the server-side, we created the following Python3 code to read and send data via Slack API: The final result is a default Beacon sending data through Slack API and the third-party server relaying it to Cobalt Strike’s Team Server, resulting in a Slack egress client/server communication: Conclusion In summary, while External C2 paved the way for flexible and stealthy command-and-control customization, its architectural and operational shortcomings eventually limited its practicality. User-Defined C2 represents a more mature evolution, delivering lighter integration, improved OPSEC, and reduced development overhead by leveraging BOFs instead of standalone clients. Although it does introduce constraints, most notably its dependency on C, it offers a far more streamlined and maintainable approach to building custom egress channels, ultimately empowering red teams with a cleaner, safer, and more scalable alternative. All codes and scripts referenced throughout this post, as well as the final project are available on our GitHub repository. References",

    "title": "Open WebUI bug turns the ‘free model’ into an enterprise backdoor",
    "summary": "Security researchers have flagged a high-severity flaw in Open WebUI , a self-hosted enterprise interface for large language models, that allows external model servers connected via its Direct Connections feature to inject malicious code and hijack AI workloads. The issue, tracked as CVE-2025-64496, stems from unsafe handling of server-sent events (SSE), enabling account takeover and, in some cases, with extended permissions, remote code execution (RCE) on backend servers. According to Cato CTRL findings, if an employee connects Open WebUI to an attacker-controlled model endpoint, like under the pretext of a “free GPT-4 alternative”, the frontend can be tricked into silently executing injected JavaScript. That code steals JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) from the browser context, offering attackers persistent access to the victim’s AI workspace, documents, chats, and embedded API keys. The bug impacts Open WebUI versions up to 0.6.34 and is fixed in v0.6.35, with enterprises urged to patch production deployments without delay. Convenience feature turned into a crisis Cato researchers said the problem is Direct Connections, a feature intended to let users connect Open WebUI to external, OpenAI-compatible model servers. The platform’s SSE handler trusts incoming events from these servers, especially those tagged as “{type: execute},” and executes their payload via a dynamic JavaScript constructor. When a user connects to a malicious server, easily enabled through social engineering , that server can stream an SSE with executable JavaScript. That script runs with full access to the browser’s storage layer, including the JWT used for authentication. “Open WebUI stores the JWT token in localStorage,” Cato researchers said in a blog post. “Any script running on the page can access it. Tokens are long-lived by default, lack HttpOnly, and are cross-tab. When combined with the execute event, this creates a window for account takeover.” The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by default) and add the attacker’s malicious model URL, according to an NVD description . Escalating to Remote Code Execution The risk doesn’t stop at account takeover. If the compromised account has workspace.tools permissions, attackers can leverage that session token to push authenticated Python code through Open WebUI’s Tools API, which executes without sandboxing or validation. This turns a browser-level compromise into full remote code execution on the backend server. Once an attacker gets Python execution, they can install persistence mechanisms, pivot into internal networks, access sensitive data stores, or run lateral attacks. The flaw received a high severity rating at 8/10 base score by NVD, and a 7.3/10 base score by GitHub. The flaw was rated high rather than critical, reflecting the fact that exploitation requires the Direct Connections feature to be enabled and hinges on a user first being lured into connecting to a malicious external model server. Patch mitigation in Open WebUI v0.6.35 involves blocking “execute” SSE events from Direct Connections entirely, but any organization still on older builds remains exposed. Additionally, the researchers advised moving authentication to short-lived and HttpOnly cookies with rotation. “Pair with a strict CSP and ban dynamic code evaluation”, they added.",

    "title": "Fake Employees, Real Threat: Decentralized Identity to combat Deepfake Hiring?",
    "summary": "In recent months, cybersecurity experts have sounded the alarm on a surge of fake “employees” – job candidates who are not who they claim to be . These fraudsters use everything from fabricated CVs and stolen identities to AI-generated deepfake videos in interviews to land jobs under false pretenses. It’s a global phenomenon making headlines on LinkedIn and in the press. With the topic surfacing everywhere, I wanted to take a closer look at what’s really going on — and explore the solutions that could help organizations respond to this growing challenge. And as it happens, one solution is finally reaching maturity at exactly the right moment: decentralized identity. Let me walk you through it. But first, let’s look at a few troubling facts: Even tech giants aren’t immune. Amazon’s Chief Security Officer revealed that since April 2024 the company has blocked over 1,800 suspected North Korean scammers from getting hired, and that the volume of such fake applicants jumped 27% each quarter this year (1.1). In fact, a coordinated scheme involving North Korean IT operatives posing as remote workers has infiltrated over 300 U.S. companies since 2020 , generating at least $6.8 million in revenue for the regime (2.1). CrowdStrike also reported more than 320 confirmed incidents in the past year alone, marking a 220% surge in activity (2.2). And it’s not just North Korea: organised crime groups globally are adopting similar tactics. This trend is not a small blip; it’s likely a sign of things to come. Gartner predicts that by 2028, one in four job applicant profiles could be fake in some way (3). Think about that – in a few years, 25% of the people applying to your jobs might be bots or impostors trying to trick their way in. We’re not just talking about exaggerated resumes; we’re talking about full-scale deception: people hiring stand-ins for interviews, AI bots filling out assessments, and deepfake avatars smiling through video calls. It’s a hiring manager’s nightmare — no one wants to waste time interviewing bots or deepfakes — and a CISO’s worst-case scenario rolled into one. The Rise of the Deepfake Employee What does a “fake employee” actually do? In many cases, these impostors are part of organized schemes (even state-sponsored) to steal money or data. They might forge impressive résumés and create a minimal but believable online presence. During remote interviews, some have been caught using deepfake video filters – basically digital masks – to appear as someone else. In one case, Amazon investigators noticed an interviewee’s typing did not sync with the on-screen video (the keystrokes had a 110ms lag); it turned out to be a North Korean hacker remotely controlling a fake persona on the video call (1.2). Others refuse video entirely, claiming technical issues, so you only hear a voice. Some even hire proxy interviewees – a real person who interviews in their place. The level of creativity is frightening. Once inside, a fake employee can do serious damage. They gain legitimate access to internal systems, data, and tools. Some have stolen sensitive source code and threatened to leak it unless the company paid a ransom (1). Others quietly set up backdoor access for future cyberattacks. And as noted, if they’re part of a nation-state operation, the salary you pay them is funding adversaries . The U.S. Department of Justice recently warned that many North Korean IT workers send the majority of their pay back to the regime’s illicit weapons programs (1)(2.3). Beyond the financial angle, think of the security breach: a malicious actor is now an “insider” with an access badge. No sector is safe. While tech companies with lots of remote jobs were the first targets, the scam has expanded. According to the World Economic Forum, about half of the companies targeted by these attacks aren’t in the tech industry at all (4). Financial services, healthcare, media, energy – any business that hires remote freelancers or IT staff could be at risk. Many Fortune 500 firms have quietly admitted to Charles Carmakal (Chief Technology Officer at Google Cloud’s Mandiant) that they’ve encountered fake candidates (2.3). Brandon Wales — former Executive Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and now VP of Cybersecurity Strategy at SentinelOne — warned that the “ scale and speed ” of these operations is unlike anything seen before (2.3). Rivka Little, Chief Growth Officer at Socure, put it bluntly: “ Every Fortune 100 and potentially Fortune 500 has a pretty high number of risky employees on their books ” right now (1). If you’re in charge of security or IT, this should send a chill down your spine. How do you defend against an attack that walks in through your front door (virtually) with HR’s approval? It calls for rethinking some fundamental practices, which leads us to the biggest gap these scams have exposed: identity verification in the hiring process. The Identity Verification Gap in Hiring Let’s face it: traditional hiring and onboarding operate on a lot of trust . You collect a résumé, maybe call some references, do a background check that might catch a criminal record but won’t catch a well-crafted fake identity . You might ask for a copy of a driver’s license or passport to satisfy HR paperwork, but how thoroughly is it checked? And once the person is hired and given an employee account, how often do we re-confirm that person’s identity in the months or years that follow? Almost never. Now let’s look at the situation from the reverse perspective: During your last recruitment, or when you became a new vendor for a client, were you asked to send over a full copy of your ID via email? Most likely, yes. You send a scan of your passport or ID card to an HR representative or a partner’s portal, and you have no idea where that image gets stored, who can see it, or how long it will sit around . It feels uncomfortable, but we do it because we need to prove who we are. In reality, we’re making a leap of faith that the process is secure. This is the identity verification gap . Companies are trusting documents and self-assertions that can be forged, and they rarely have a way to verify those beyond a cursory glance. Fraudsters exploit this gap mercilessly. They provide fake documents that look real, or steal someone else’s identity details to pass background checks. Once they’ve cleared that initial hurdle, the organization treats them as legit. IT sets up accounts, security gives them access, and from then on the “user identity” is assumed to be genuine. Forever. Moreover, once an employee is on board, internal processes often default to trust. Need a password reset? The helpdesk might ask for your birthdate or employee ID – pieces of info a savvy attacker can learn or steal. We don’t usually ask an employee who calls IT to re-prove that they are the same person HR hired months or years ago. All of this stands in contrast to the principle of Zero Trust security that many companies are now adopting. Thanks to John Kindervag (Forrester, 2009), Zero Trust says “never trust, always verify” each access request. But how can you verify if the underlying identity was fake to start with? As part of Microsoft, we often say that “identity is the new perimeter” – meaning the primary defense line is verifying identities, not just securing network walls. If that identity perimeter is built on shaky ground (unverified people), the whole security model is weak. So, what can be done? Security leaders and even the World Economic Forum are advocating for stronger identity proofing in hiring. The WEF specifically recommends “verifiable government ID checks at multiple stages of recruitment and into employment” (4). In other words, don’t just verify once and forget it – verify early, verify often. That might mean an ID and background check when offering the job, another verification during onboarding, and perhaps periodic re-checks or at least on certain events (like when the employee requests elevated privileges). Amazon’s CSO, S. Schmidt, echoed this after battling North Korean fakes; he advised companies to “Implement identity verification at multiple hiring stages and monitor for anomalous technical behavior” as a key defense (1). Of course, doing this manually is tough. You can’t very well ask each candidate to fly in their first day just to show their passport in person, especially with global and remote workforces. That’s where technology is stepping up. Enter the world of Verified ID and decentralized identity. Enter Microsoft Entra Verified ID: proving Identity, not just Checking a Box Imagine if, instead of emailing copies of your passport to every new employer or partner, you could carry a digital identity credential that is already verified and can be trusted by others instantly. That’s the idea behind Microsoft Entra Verified ID . It’s essentially a system for issuing and verifying cryptographically-secure digital identity credentials . Let’s break down what that means in plain terms. At its core, a Verified ID credential is like a digital ID card that lives in an app on your phone. But unlike a photocopy of your driver’s license (which anyone could copy, steal or tamper with), this digital credential is signed with cryptographic keys that make it tamper-proof and verifiable. It’s based on open standards. Microsoft has been heavily involved in the development of Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and W3C Verifiable Credentials standards over the past few years (7). The benefit of standards is that this isn’t a proprietary Microsoft-only thing – it’s part of a broader move toward decentralized identity, where the user is in control of their own credentials . Here’s a real-life analogy: When you go to a bar and need to prove you’re over 18, you show your driver’s license, National ID or Passport. The bouncer checks your birth date and maybe the hologram, but they don’t photocopy your entire ID and keep it; they just verify it and hand it back. You remain in possession of your ID. Now translate that to digital interactions: with Verified ID, you could have a credential on your phone that says “Government ID verified: [Your Name], age 25”. When a verifier (like an employer or service) needs proof, you share that credential through a secure app . The verifier’s system checks the credential’s digital signature to confirm it was issued by a trusted authority (for example, a background check company or a government agency) and that it hasn’t been altered. You don’t have to send over a scan of your actual passport or reveal extra info like your full birthdate or address – the credential can be designed to reveal only the necessary facts (e.g. “is over 18” = yes). This concept is called selective disclosure , and it’s a big win for privacy. Crucially, you decide which credentials to share and with whom . You might have one that proves your legal name and age (from a government issuer), another that proves your employment status (from your employer), another that proves a certification or degree (from a university). And you only share them when needed . They can also have expiration dates or be revoked. For instance, an employment credential could automatically expire when you leave the company. This means if someone tries to use an old credential, it would fail verification – another useful security feature. Now, how do these credentials get issued in the first place? This is where the integration of our Microsoft Partner IDEMIA comes in, which was a highlight of Microsoft Ignite 2025. IDEMIA is a company you might not have heard of, but they’re a huge player in the identity world – they’re the folks behind many government ID and biometric systems (think passport chips, national ID programs, biometric border control, etc.). Microsoft announced that Entra Verified ID now integrate IDEMIA’s identity verification services . In practice, this means when you need a high-assurance credential (like proving your real identity for a job), the system can invoke IDEMIA to do a thorough check. For example, as part of a remote onboarding process, an employer using Verified ID could ask the new hire to verify their identity through IDEMIA . The new hire gets a link or prompt, and is guided to scan their official government ID and take a live selfie video . IDEMIA’s system checks that the ID is authentic (not a forgery) and matches the person’s face, doing so in a privacy-protecting way (for instance, biometric data might be used momentarily to match and then not stored long-term, depending on the service policies). This process confirms “Yes, this is Alice, and we’ve confirmed her identity with a passport and live face check.” At that point, Microsoft Entra Verified ID can issue a credential to Alice, such as “Alice – identity verified by Contoso Corp on [Date]” . Alice stores this credential in her digital wallet (for instance, the Microsoft Authenticator app). Now Alice can present that credential to apps or IT systems to prove it’s really Alice . The employer might require it to activate her accounts, or later if Alice calls IT support, they might ask her to present the credential to prove her identity for a password reset. The verification of the credential is cryptographically secure and instantaneous – the IT system just checks the digital signature. There’s no need to manually pull up Alice’s passport scan from HR files or interrogate her with personal questions. Plus, Alice isn’t repeatedly sending sensitive personal documents ; she shared them once with a trusted verifier (IDEMIA via the Verified ID app flow), not with every individual who asks for ID. This reduces the exposure of her personal data. From the company’s perspective, this approach dramatically improves security and streamlines processes . During onboarding, it’s actually faster to have someone go through an automated ID verification flow than to coordinate an in-person verification or trust slow manual checks. Organizations also avoid collecting and storing piles of personal documents , which is a compliance headache and a breach risk. Instead, they get a cryptographic assurance. Think of it like the difference between keeping copies of everyone’s credit card versus using a payment token – the latter is safer and just as effective for the transaction. Microsoft has been laying the groundwork for this for years. Back in 2020 (and even 2017....), Microsoft discussed decentralized identity concepts where users own their identity data and apps verify facts about you through digital attestations (7). Now it’s reality: Entra Verified ID uses those open standards (DID and Verifiable Credentials) under the hood. Plus, the integration with IDEMIA and others means it’s not just theoretical — it’s operational and scalable . As Ankur Patel, one of our product leaders for Microsoft Entra, said about these integrations: it enables “high assurance verification without custom business contracts or technical implementations” (6). In other words, companies can now easily plug this capability in, rather than building their own verification processes from scratch. Before moving on, let’s not forget to include the promised quote from IDEMIA’s exec that really underscores the value: “With more than 40 years of experience in identity issuance, verification and advanced biometrics, our collaboration with Microsoft enables secure authentication with verified identities organizations can rely on to ensure individuals are who they claim to be and critical services can be accessed seamlessly and securely.” – Amit Sharma, Head of Digital Strategy, IDEMIA (6) That quote basically says it all: verified identities that organizations can rely on, enabling seamless and secure access. Now, let’s see how that translates into real-world usage. Use Cases and Benefits: From Onboarding to Recovery How can Verified ID (plus IDEMIA’s) be applied in day-to-day business? There are several high-impact use cases: Remote Employee Onboarding (aka Hire with Confidence): This is the most straightforward scenario. When bringing in a new hire you haven’t met in person, you can integrate an identity verification step. As described earlier, the new employee verifies their government ID and face once, gets a credential, and uses that to start their work. The hiring team can trust that “this person is real and is who they say they are.” This directly prevents many fake-employee scams. In fact, some companies have already tried informal versions of this: The Register reported a story of an identity verification company (ironically) who, after seeing suspicious candidates, told one applicant “next interview we’ll do a document verification, it’s easy, we’ll send you a barcode to scan your ID” – and that candidate never showed up for the next round because they knew they’d be caught (1). With Verified ID, this becomes a standard, automated part of the process, not an ad-hoc test. As a bonus, the employee’s Verified ID credential can also speed up IT onboarding (auto-provisioning accounts when the verified credential is presented) and even simplify things like proving work authorization to other services (think how you often have to send copies of IDs to benefits providers or background screeners – a credential could replace that). The new hire starts faster, and with less anxiety because they know there’s a strong proof attached to their identity, and the company has less risk from day one. Oh, and HR isn’t stuck babysitting sensitive documents – governance and privacy risk go down. Stronger Helpdesk and Support Authentication: Helpdesk fraud is a common way attackers exploit weak verification. Instead of asking employees for their first pet’s name or a short code (which an attacker might phish), support can use Verified ID to confirm the person’s identity. For example, if someone calls IT saying “I’m locked out of my account,” the support portal can send a push notification asking the user to present their Verified Employee credential or do a quick re-verify via the app. If the person on the phone is an impostor, they’ll fail this check. If it’s the real employee, it’s an easy tap on their phone to prove it’s them. This approach secures processes like password resets, unlocking accounts, or granting temporary access. Think of it as caller-ID on steroids . Instead of taking someone’s word that “I am Alice from Finance,” the system actually asks for proof. And because the proof is cryptographically verified, it’s much harder to trick than a human support agent with a sob story. This reduces the burden on support too – less time playing detective with personal questions, more confidence in automating certain requests. Account Recovery and On-Demand Re-Verification: We’ve all dealt with the hassle of account recovery when we lose a password or device. Often it’s a weak link: backup codes, personal Q&A, the support team asking some manager who can’t even tell if it’s really you, or asking for a copy of your ID… With Verified ID, organizations can offer a secure self-service recovery that doesn’t rely on shared secrets. For instance, if you lose access to your multi-factor auth and need to regain entry, you could be prompted to verify your identity with a government ID check through the Verified ID system. Once you pass, you might be allowed to reset your authentication methods. Microsoft is already moving in this direction – there’s talk of replacing security questions with Verified ID checks for Entra ID account recovery (6). The benefit here is you get high assurance that the person recovering the account is the legitimate owner . This is especially important for administrators or other highly privileged users. And it’s still faster for the user than, say, waiting days for IT to manual vet and approve a request. Additionally, companies could have policies where every X months, employees might get a prompt to reaffirm their identity if they’re engaging in sensitive work. It keeps everyone honest and catches any anomalies (like, imagine an attacker somehow compromised an account – when faced with an unexpected ID check, they wouldn’t be able to comply, raising a red flag). Step-Up Authentication for Sensitive Actions: Not every action an employee takes needs this level of verification, but some absolutely do. For example, a finance officer making a $10 million wire transfer, or an engineer pushing code to a production environment, or an HR admin downloading an entire employee database – these could all trigger a step-up authentication that includes verifying the user’s identity credential. In practice, the user might get a pop-up saying “Please present your Verified ID to continue.” It might even ask for a quick fresh selfie depending on the sensitivity, which can be matched against the one on file (using Face Match in a privacy-conscious way). This is like saying: “We know you logged in with your password and MFA earlier, but this action is so critical that we want to double-check you are still the one executing it – not someone who stole your session or is using your computer.” It’s analogous to how some banks send a one-time code for high-value transactions, but instead of just a code (which could be stolen), it’s verifying you . This dramatically reduces the risk of insider threats and account takeovers causing catastrophic damage. And for the user, it’s usually a simple extra step that they’ll understand the importance of, especially in high-stakes fields. It builds trust – both that the company trusts them enough to give access, but also verifies them to ensure no one is impersonating them. In all these cases, Verified ID is adding security without a huge usability cost. In fact, many users might prefer it to the status quo: I’d rather verify my identity once properly than have to answer a bunch of security questions or have an IT person eyeballing my ID over a grainy video call. It also introduces transparency and control . As an employee, if I’m using a Verified ID, I know exactly what credential I’m sharing and why, and I have a log of it. It’s not an opaque process where I send documents into a void. From a governance perspective, using Verified ID means less widespread personal data to protect , and a clearer audit trail of “this action was taken by Alice, whose identity was verified by method X at time Y.” It can even help with regulatory compliance – for instance, proving that you really know who has access to sensitive financial data (important for things like SOX compliance or other audits). And circling back to the theme of fake employees , if such a system is in place, it’s a massive deterrent. The barrier to entry for fraudsters becomes much higher. It’s not impossible (nothing is, and you still need to Assume breach ), but now they’d have to fool a top-tier document verification and biometric check – not just an overworked recruiter. That likely requires physical presence and high-quality fake documents, which are riskier and more costly for attackers. The more companies adopt such measures, the less “return on investment” these hiring scams will have for cybercriminals. The Bigger Picture: Verified Identity as the New Security Frontier The convergence of trends here is interesting. On one hand, we have digital transformation and remote work which opened the door to these novel attacks. On the other hand, we have new security philosophies like Zero Trust that emphasize continuous verification of identity and context. Verified ID is essentially Zero Trust for the hiring and identity side of things: “never trust an identity claim, always verify it.” What’s exciting is that this can now be done without turning the enterprise into a surveillance state or creating unbearable friction for legitimate users. It leverages cryptography and user-centric design to raise security and preserve privacy. Microsoft’s involvement in decentralized identity and the integration of partners like IDEMIA signals that this approach is maturing. It’s moving from pilot projects to being built into mainstream products (Entra ID, Microsoft 365, LinkedIn even offers verification badges via Entra Verified ID now (5)). It’s worth noting LinkedIn’s angle here: job seekers can verify where they work or their government ID on their LinkedIn profile, which could also help employers spot fakes (though it’s voluntary and early-stage). For CISOs and identity architects, Verified ID offers a concrete tool to address what was previously a very squishy problem . Instead of just crossing your fingers that employees are who they say they are, you can enforce it. It’s analogous to the evolution of payments security: we moved from signatures (which were rarely checked) to PIN codes and chips, and now to contactless cryptographic payments. Hiring and access management can undergo a similar upgrade from assumption-based to verification-based. Of course, adopting Verified ID or any new identity tech requires planning. Organizations will need to update their onboarding processes, train HR and IT staff on the new procedure, and ensure employees are comfortable with it. Privacy considerations must be addressed (e.g., clarify that biometric data used for verification isn’t stored indefinitely, etc.). But compared to the alternative – doing nothing and hoping to avoid being the next company in a scathing news headline about North Korean fake workers – the effort is worthwhile. In summary, human identity has become the new primary perimeter for cybersecurity. We can build all the firewalls and endpoint protections we want, but if a malicious actor can legitimately log in through the front door as an employee, those defenses may not matter. Verified identity solutions like Microsoft Entra Verified ID (with partners like IDEMIA) provide a way to fortify that perimeter with strong, real-time checks. They bring trust back into remote interactions by shifting from “trust by default” to “trust because verified.” This is not just a theoretical future; it’s happening now. As of late 2025, these tools are generally available and being rolled out in enterprises. Early adopters will likely be those in highly targeted sectors or with regulatory pressures – think defense contractors, financial institutions, and tech companies burned by experience. But I suspect it will trickle into standard best practices over the next few years, much like multi-factor authentication did. The fight against fake employees and deepfake hiring scams will continue, and attackers will evolve new tricks (perhaps trying to fake the verifications themselves). But having this layer in place tilts the balance back in favor of the defenders. It forces attackers to take more risks and expend more resources, which in turn dissuades many from even trying. To end on a practical note: If you’re a security decision-maker, now is a good time to evaluate your organization’s hiring and identity verification practices . Conduct a risk assessment – do you have any way to truly verify a new remote hire’s identity? How confident are you that all your current employees are real? If those questions make you uncomfortable, it’s worth looking into solutions like Verified ID. We’re entering an era where digital identity proofing will be as standard as background checks in HR processes. The technology has caught up to the threat, and embracing it could save your company from a very costly “lesson learned.” Remember: trust is good, but verified trust is better . By making identity verification a seamless part of the employee lifecycle, we can help ensure that the only people on the payroll are the ones we intended to hire. In a world of sophisticated fakes, that confidence is priceless. Sources: (1.1) The Register – Amazon blocked 1,800 suspected North Korean scammers seeking jobs (Dec 18, 2025) – S.

    "title": "Reflecting on a year of transformation and mission impact together",
    "summary": "Looking back on the past year, I am filled with immense pride about what we've achieved together. It was a year of unprecedented innovation, where the promise of AI became a powerful reality for government agencies, research organizations and education institutions across our nation. At Google Public Sector, we've had the privilege of partnering with forward-thinking leaders and teams to push the bounds of what’s possible, and I’m so inspired by the progress we've made. Let’s take a closer look at some of the key highlights from 2025 as we chart this new era of innovation - and this new year ahead, together. 1. Cloud without compromise We believe that the public sector should have access to abundant, accredited commercial cloud services, free from any 'GovCloud' constraints. We continue to reinforce our commitment to this vision with investments across our integrated AI stack to power missions across the public sector. To that end, we announced that Gemini in Workspace apps and the Gemini app were the first generative AI assistants for productivity and collaboration suites to achieve FedRAMP High authorization . We also announced FedRAMP High authorization for key AI and data analytics services, including Agent Assist, Looker (Google Cloud core) and Vertex AI Vector Search – foundational components of broader AI and data cloud solutions that can help automate institutional knowledge, bolster efficiency, drive greater worker productivity, and surface insights for more informed decision making. We are excited to partner with the Defense Logistics Agency, who selected Google Public Sector to modernize global supply chain operations – the agency’s first AI-ready commercial cloud partnership. By migrating to Google Cloud, DLA will be able to harness modern cloud best practices combined with Google's highly performant and resilient cloud infrastructure. This partnership with DLA builds on the momentum of a recent $200 million-ceiling contract award by the DoD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to accelerate AI and cloud capabilities across the agency. 2. Always-on security We believe that a Zero Trust foundation powered by AI can be a force multiplier for security. Today’s mission-critical workloads require absolute assurance, and we continue to reinforce our commitment as a trusted partner for the nation's most sensitive data and operations, from the data center to the tactical edge. We achieved DoD Impact Level 6 (IL6) authorization for Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) and the GDC air-gapped appliance , building upon our existing IL5 and Top Secret accreditations. This allows the DoD to host their most sensitive Secret classified data and applications while leveraging the full power of advanced services like Vertex AI and Gemini models—all at the edge and in disconnected environments. We also successfully achieved Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 2 certification under the DoD’s CMMC program, affirming that Google Public Sector’s internal systems used to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) meet the DoD’s rigorous cybersecurity standards for protecting CUI. Furthermore, our expanded collaboration with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) will enable us to accelerate innovation for the U.S. government. This collaboration will focus on bringing secure artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud solutions to the tactical edge for defense and intelligence agencies, and modernizing citizen services for civilian agencies. Through this collaboration, GDIT will combine its mission and integration expertise with Google Cloud’s AI, cloud and cybersecurity offerings. 3. Agent powered transformation and collaboration We believe AI and agents will help the public sector become more productive and efficient than ever before. To that end, we introduced Gemini for Government , the new front door for the best of Google’s AI-optimized, secure and accredited commercial cloud services, our industry-leading Gemini models - including our most recently released Gemini 3 Flash - as well as our agentic AI solutions. Gemini for Government allows government agencies to leverage the same powerful technology used by our commercial enterprise customers to unlock the next wave of AI-powered innovation and transformation across the public sector. We are excited to support the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO), who selected Google Cloud's Gemini for Government to serve as the first enterprise AI deployed on the U.S. Department of War (DoW)'s GenAI.mil to 3 million civilian and military personnel. As one of the world's largest employers, the DoW's adoption of Gemini for Government highlights the technology platform's unique ability to deliver secure, sovereign, and enterprise-ready AI that supports the department's unclassified work, simplifying routine tasks like summarizing policy handbooks and drafting email correspondence. This builds on our prior announcements that the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) awarded Google Public Sector with a $200 million contract to accelerate AI and cloud capabilities, giving the agency access to our most advanced AI innovations. We are also thrilled to support the FDA in taking such a pioneering step in public health innovation with the deployment of agentic AI capabilities across the agency. These new multi-step AI workflows, which leverage powerful models including Gemini for Government, are not just about efficiency – this puts world-class tools into the hands of their reviewers and scientists to streamline complex tasks and further ensure the safety and efficacy of regulated products.

    "title": "Singapore Cyber Agency Warns of Critical IBM API Connect Vulnerability (CVE-2025-13915)",
    "summary": "Overview The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore has issued an alert regarding a critical vulnerability affecting IBM API Connect, following the release of official security updates by IBM on 2 January 2026. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-13915, carries a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, placing it among the most severe vulnerabilities currently disclosed for enterprise automation software. According to IBM’s security bulletin, the issue stems from an authentication bypass weakness that could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to affected systems without valid credentials. The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of IBM API Connect, a widely used platform for managing application programming interfaces across enterprise environments. Details of CVE-2025-13915 and Technical Impact IBM confirmed that CVE-2025-13915 was identified through internal testing and classified under CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness. The flaw allows authentication mechanisms to be bypassed, despite the underlying authentication algorithm itself being sound. The weakness arises from an implementation flaw that can be exploited independently. The official CVSS vector for the vulnerability is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H This indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requires no user interaction, and can lead to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. IBM stated that successful exploitation could enable attackers to access the application remotely and operate with unauthorized privileges. Data from Cyble Vision further classifies the issue as “very critical,” confirming that IBM API Connect up to versions 10.0.8.5 and 10.0.11.0 is affected. Affected IBM API Connect Versions IBM confirmed that the following versions are vulnerable to CVE-2025-13915: IBM API Connect V10.0.8.0 through V10.0.8.5 IBM API Connect V10.0.11.0 No evidence has been disclosed indicating active exploitation in the wild, and the vulnerability is not currently listed in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. CVE-2025-13915 Not Added to CISA KEV (Source: CISA) Cyble Vision data also indicates that the vulnerability has not been discussed in underground forums, suggesting no known public exploit circulation at this time. No discussion of the CVE-2025-13915 vulnerability in underground forums (Source: Cyble) The EPSS score for CVE-2025-13915 stands at 0.37, indicating a moderate probability of exploitation compared to other high-severity vulnerabilities. Remediation and Mitigation Guidance IBM has released interim fixes (iFixes) to address the vulnerability and strongly recommends that affected organizations apply updates immediately. For IBM API Connect V10.0.8, fixes are available for each sub-version from 10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5. A separate interim fix has also been released for IBM API Connect V10.0.11.0. IBM’s advisory explicitly states: “IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now by upgrading.” For environments where immediate patching is not possible, IBM advises administrators to disable self-service sign-up on the Developer Portal, if enabled. This mitigation can help reduce exposure by limiting potential abuse paths until updates can be applied. Cyble Vision reinforces this recommendation, noting that upgrading removes the vulnerability entirely, and that temporary mitigations should only be considered short-term risk reduction measures. Broader Security Context The disclosure of CVE-2025-13915 reinforces the persistent risk posed by authentication bypass vulnerabilities in enterprise platforms such as IBM API Connect. Classified under CWE-305 and CWE-287, the flaw demonstrates how implementation weaknesses can negate otherwise robust authentication controls. Despite the absence of confirmed exploitation, the vulnerability, remote attack surface, and critical CVSS score of 9.8 make immediate remediation necessary. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s alert reflects heightened regional scrutiny of high-impact vulnerabilities affecting widely deployed enterprise software. IBM’s advisory, first published on 17 December 2025 and reinforced in January 2026, provides clear guidance on patching and mitigation. Organizations running affected versions of IBM API Connect should assess exposure without delay and apply the recommended fixes to reduce risk. Threat intelligence data from Cyble Vision further confirms the vulnerability’s severity, its impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and the effectiveness of upgrading as the primary remediation. Continuous monitoring and contextual intelligence remain critical for identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities with enterprise-wide consequences like CVE-2025-13915. Security teams tracking high-risk vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-13915 need real-time visibility, context, and prioritization.

    "title": "6 strategies for building a high-performance cybersecurity team",
    "summary": "Longtime security chief George Gerchow had sought top-notch security engineers and developers to build his team. Gerchow considered these workers “superstars” — and they proved him right in many ways. They were ambitious go-getters “who came in and absolutely killed it. They’d do a great job, but then they’d move on.” Gerchow discovered that a collection of such superstars didn’t create a high-performing team, which he defines as one that works well together to protect the company, leans in, and builds trust among themselves and the business units. He realized to build a great team he needed a better mix of worker types. Such teams don’t come together without effort. “Everyone needs to work on creating better teams,” Gerchow says. Here, he and other veteran security leaders share six strategies to do that. 1. Build a diverse team Having learned as CISO at a past company that having only one type of worker doesn’t get him the best overall team, Gerchow changed his recruiting and hiring practices . He sought to balance out the highly ambitious engineers he hired for innovation and big initiatives — and whose tenures could be short-lived, as they chased other projects — with those he calls “rock stars” —diligent, focused workers who deftly and reliably handled the day-to-day routine tasks that make up the bulk of security department responsibilities. “You need a mixture of both of those,” says Gerchow, now CSO at Bedrock Security and a faculty member at IANS Research. Gerchow also advocates for hiring workers with diverse backgrounds, saying “getting those different backgrounds brings different perspectives, and getting those into the security strategy is great; it builds different synergies.” 2. Be clear on the mission Sharon Chand , US cyber defense and resilience leader at professional services firm Deloitte, says a characteristic of a high-performing team is alignment on the team’s mission. To do that, though, team members need to know what the mission is and buy into it . “It has to be a very clear mission that the leaders have articulated,” she says, explaining that the mission gives guidance on what everyone should be doing. CISOs may think that the security’s department mission is clear — or that the mission is simply stated as “protect the organization from threats” — but Chand says a mission that provides clarity and details on the risks, threats, and security priorities that are unique to the organization based on its industry and business gives the teams an objective to rally around and direction on how to act “without having to check in and run things up the chain.” In that way, Chand says a clear mission allows for speed — a needed attribute for security teams in an era when the pace of attacks is accelerating . “A mark of a high-performing team is when the team understands its role in helping the business be successful, because they understand it’s not just about driving down critical alerts or responding to events within certain SLAs; it’s about making sure the business can continue to run. That helps with purpose and motivation,” Chand adds. Gerchow also sees how a clear mission helps build a strong team: “Telling developers they have to do something for compliance doesn’t excite them,” he says, “but it does if you talk about risk and how to advance the business, if you put it in terms of what’s in it for the business.” 3. Properly equip the team to fulfill the mission A high-performing team needs the right training, tools, and techniques to fulfill its mission, and that’s no different in the cybersecurity space, Chand says. Of course, no CISO has an unlimited budget to fund every need staffers might identify, so it’s important to be strategic by knowing the team members’ strengths and by identifying where they need more training, what tools they’re best equipped to optimize, and where they must focus on improvement. “CISOs need to be enabling them with the right training and technology to evolve their skills to meet the mission,” Chand adds. That now includes ensuring the security team can use artificial intelligence to transform their roles, she says. “It’s teaching them to use data and analytics and how to use AI in a different way.” The use of AI also boosts the ability to improve team performance, Chand notes, as scaling the use of AI in the security department “creates bandwidth” that enables CISOs and their staffers to move out of reactive mode and gain time and resources to upskill. 4. Be great at prioritizing CISOs can build a high-performing team by getting better at setting and communicating priorities so team members know where to focus their time and efforts, says Nathan Wenzler , field CISO for client advisory at cybersecurity firm Optiv. “We’ve known in the industry for a long time that we can’t boil the ocean, we can’t patch every vulnerability, we can’t fix every line of code. There’s simply too much to do, and we don’t have the resources to do it all. So prioritization is the right path,” he says. “It’s a function that a lot of people say they do, but many aren’t executing it well.” CISOs who consolidate data from their security tools to create a holistic view of threats and vulnerabilities and align security strategy to the business are able to gain clarity on priorities and better direct their teams, Wenzler says. “This isn’t an easy problem to solve,” he adds, “but where it does get solved, it becomes much easier to do an apples-to-apples comparison to where you’re at most risk and then prioritize what work needs to get done.” 5. Build workers’ soft skills to boost engagement with business peers Security pros don’t always come with strong business, communication, and leadership skills. “We spent the past 20 years or so getting really good at the technical; now we absolutely need to start building the soft skills on our teams,” Wenzler says. He stresses the need for communications skills specifically, saying they’re essential for security teams to effectively articulate information about the policies and procedures that the business needs to follow to counteract cyber threats. “The teams that perform best today are the ones that successfully get everyone else to buy into what they’re doing,” Wenzler says. “They [achieve] that when they’re seen as business enablers and not just a division of IT, and they do that when they’re communicating in the language that the business understands.” The ability for security pros to effectively engage with their business peers through improved communication, business acumen, empathy, and the like helps them be better workers, too, Wenzler explains. That’s because they gain more insight and clarity into the risks that matter most to the business, insight that they can then apply to how they do their security jobs. Others note that security teams that have a strong rapport and collaboration with their business counterparts also have more cross-functional influence and higher levels of trust, both of which help them get buy-in on security rules and requirements. “That means security gets done and actual improvements happen,” Wenzler adds. 6. Appoint — and empower — deputies High-performing teams have CISOs who know they can’t do everything on their own and instead rely on deputies to help carry the load, says Steve Martano , faculty at IANS Research and a partner in Artico Search’s cybersecurity practice. “A CISO should be identifying their top deputies or, if they already have them, they should be assigning them more of the operational tasks and the strategic needs related to their discipline, which enables the CISO to be more of that business risk executive and really serve as the peer of the CFO, the head of product, and the P&L leaders in the business,” Martano says. This may seem like more of a win for the CISO than the team as a whole, but that’s not the case, Martano says. Rather, this creates stronger leaders throughout the security department who can respond quickly to team members’ needs — rather than always having to escalate questions, issues, and plans up to the CISO and waiting for responses. “Strong deputies mean that you as a CISO can save cycles, because you don’t have to be as attentive to the day-to-day operational work they’re leading,” Martano says. Empowering deputies can be hard for CISOs, Martano says, noting “there are a lot of CISOs who operate out of an abundance of caution and therefore micromanage their teams.” He advises CISOs who want to build a stronger leadership team to first assess who they have, what skills they possess, and what skills they need to build. CISOs then need to plan how they’ll train those leaders to take on more executive-level tasks and oversight . “Give them the latitude to make decisions, to make mistakes, and use you as a sounding board,” Martano says. “Have people represent you in meetings, and try to get the most out of people by making them think more business-wise and more strategically.” Martano says creating a strong leadership team has benefits that cascade throughout the ranks, as these deputies tend to bring the same approach to those they supervise, empowering their own direct reports and expecting them to do the same with those reporting to them. As a result, workers at all levels are upskilling, taking on more responsibilities, and accepting more accountability. “These CISOs,” Martano says, “are creating an environment that is fostering leaders down the chain.”",

I’ll work through 27 challenges ranging from beginner-friendly to expert-level, covering web exploitation, reverse engineering, cloud security, AI prompt injection, cryptography, and signal analysis to help stop Frosty and save the neighborhood. I’ll also write a hack the game itself, writing a TamperMonkey plugin to do NPC / terminal / door / item locations, teleportation, and allow walking through walls. I’ll find a bunch of hidden gnomes hanging out in a patch of snow and uncover how the game developers made the running gnomes, and a bunch of Easter Eggs as well.",

    "title": "Microsoft Copilot Studio vs. Microsoft Foundry: Building AI Agents and Apps",
    "summary": "Microsoft Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry (often referred to as Azure AI Foundry ) are two key platforms in Microsoft’s AI ecosystem that allow organizations to create custom AI agents and AI-enabled applications. While both share the goal of enabling businesses to build intelligent, task-oriented “copilot” solutions, they are designed for different audiences and use cases. To help you decide which path suits your organization, this blog provides an educational comparison of Copilot Studio vs. Azure AI Foundry, focusing on their unique strengths, feature parity and differences, and key criteria like control requirements, preferences, and integration needs. By understanding these factors, technical decision-makers, developers, IT admins, and business leaders can confidently select the right platform or even a hybrid approach for their AI agent projects. Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry: At a Glance Copilot Studio is designed for business teams, pro‑makers, and IT admins who want a managed, low‑code SaaS environment with plug‑and‑play integrations. Microsoft Foundry is built for professional developers who need fine‑grained control, customization, and integration into their existing application and cloud infrastructure. And the good news? Organizations often use both and they work together beautifully. Feature Parity and Key Differences While both platforms can achieve similar outcomes, they do so via different means. Here’s a high-level comparison of Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry: Factor Copilot Studio (SaaS, Low-Code) Microsoft (Azure) AI Foundry (PaaS, Pro-Code) Target Users & Skills Business domain experts, IT pros, and “pro-makers” comfortable with low-code tools. Little to no coding is required for building agents. Ideal for quick solutions within business units. Professional developers, software engineers, and data scientists with coding/DevOps expertise. Deep programming skills needed for custom code, DevOps, and advanced AI scenarios. Suited for complex, large-scale AI projects. Platform Model Software-as-a-Service – fully managed by Microsoft. Agents and tools are built and run in Microsoft’s cloud (M365/Copilot service) with no infrastructure to manage. Simplified provisioning, automatic updates, and built-in compliance with Microsoft 365 environment. Platform-as-a-Service, runs in your Azure subscription. You deploy and manage the agent’s infrastructure (e.g. Azure compute, networking, storage) in your cloud. Offers full control over environment, updates, and data residency. Integration & Data Out-of-box connectors & data integrations for Microsoft 365 (SharePoint, Outlook, Teams) and 3rd-party SaaS via Power Platform connectors. Easy integration with business systems without coding, ideal for leveraging existing M365 and Power Platform assets. Data remains in Microsoft’s cloud (with M365 compliance and Purview governance) by default. Deep custom integration with any system or data source via code. Natively works with Azure services (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Functions, Kubernetes, Service Bus, etc.) and can connect to on-prem or multi-cloud resources via custom connectors. Suitable when data/code must stay in your network or cloud for compliance or performance reasons. Development Experience Low-code, UI-driven development. Build agents with visual designers and prompt editors. No-code orchestration through Topics (conversational flows) and Agent Flows (Power Automate). Rich library of pre-built components (tools/capabilities) that are auto-managed and continuously improved by Microsoft (e.g. Copilot connectors for M365, built-in tool evaluations). Emphasizes speed and simplicity over granular control. Code-first development. Offers web-based studio plus extensive SDKs, CLI, and VS Code integration for coding agents and custom tools. Supports full DevOps: you can use GitHub/Azure DevOps for CI/CD, custom testing, version control, and integrate with your existing software development toolchain. Provides maximum flexibility to define bespoke logic, but requires more time and skill, sacrificing immediate simplicity for long-term extensibility. Control & Governance Managed environment – minimal configuration needed. Governance is handled via Microsoft’s standard M365 admin centers: e.g. Admin Center, Entra ID, Microsoft Purview, Defender for identity, access, auditing, and compliance across copilots. Updates and performance optimizations (e.g. tool improvements) are applied automatically by Microsoft. Limited need (or ability) to tweak infrastructure or model behavior under the hood – fits organizations that want Microsoft to manage the heavy lifting. Microsoft Foundry provides a pro‑code, Azure‑native environment for teams that need full control over the agent runtime, integrations, and development workflow. Full stack control – you manage how and where agents run. Customizable governance using Azure’s security & monitoring tools: Azure AD (identity/RBAC), Key Vault, network security (private endpoints, VNETs), plus integrated logging and telemetry via Azure Monitor, App Insights, etc. Foundry includes a developer control plane for observing, debugging, and evaluating agents during development and runtime. This is ideal for organizations requiring fine-grained control, custom compliance configurations, and rigorous LLMOps practices. Deployment Channels One-click publishing to Microsoft 365 experiences (Teams, Outlook), web chat, SharePoint, email, and more – thanks to native support for multiple channels in Copilot Studio. Everything runs in the cloud; you don’t worry about hosting the bot. Flexible deployment options. Foundry agents can be exposed via APIs or the Activity Protocol, and integrated into apps or custom channels using the M365 Agents SDK. Foundry also supports deploying agents as web apps, containers, Azure Functions, or even private endpoints for internal use, giving teams freedom to run agents wherever needed (with more setup). Control and customization Copilot Studio trades off fine-grained control for simplicity and speed. It abstracts away infrastructure and handles many optimizations for you, which accelerates development but limits how deeply you can tweak the agent’s behavior. Azure Foundry, by contrast, gives you extensive control over the agent’s architecture, tools and environment – at the cost of more complex setup and effort. Consider your project’s needs: Does it demand custom code, specialized model tuning or on-premises data? If yes, Foundry provides the necessary flexibility. Common Scenarios · HR or Finance teams building departmental AI assistants · Sales operations automating workflows and knowledge retrieval · Fusion teams starting quickly without developer-heavy resources Copilot Studio gives teams a powerful way to build agents quickly without needing to set up compute, networking, identity or DevOps pipeline · Embedding agents into production SaaS apps · If team uses professional developer frameworks (Semantic Kernel, LangChain, AutoGen, etc.) · Building multi‑agent architectures with complex toolchains · You require integration with existing app code or multi-cloud architecture. · You need full observability, versioning, instrumentation or custom DevOps. Foundry is ideal for software engineering teams who need configurability, extensibility and industrial-grade DevOps. Benefits of Combined Use: Embracing Hybrid approach One important insight is that Copilot Studio and Foundry are not mutually exclusive. In fact, Microsoft designed them to be interoperable so that organizations can use both in tandem for different parts of a solution. This is especially relevant for large projects or “fusion teams” that include both low-code creators and pro developers. The pattern many enterprises land on: Developers build specialized tools / agents in Foundry Makers assemble user-facing workflow experience in Copilot Studio Agents can collaborate via agent-to-agent patterns (including A2A, where applicable) Figure 1: Combined workflow of Copilot Studio and Foundry Using both platforms together unlocks the best of both worlds: Seamless User Experience : Copilot Studio provides a polished, user-friendly interface for end-users, while Azure AI Foundry handles complex backend logic and data processing. Advanced AI Capabilities : Leverage Azure AI Foundry’s extensive model library and orchestration features to build sophisticated agents that can reason, learn, and adapt. Scalability & Flexibility : Azure AI Foundry’s cloud-native architecture ensures scalability for high-demand scenarios, while Copilot Studio’s low-code approach accelerates development cycles. For the customers who don’t want to decide up front, Microsoft introduced a unified approach for scaling agent initiatives: Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan (P3) as part of the broader Agent Factory story, designed to reduce procurement friction across both platforms. Security & Compliance using Microsoft Purview Microsoft Copilot Studio : Microsoft Purview extends enterprise-grade security and compliance to agents built with Microsoft Copilot Studio by bringing AI interaction governance into the same control plane you use for the rest of Microsoft 365. With Purview, you can apply DSPM for AI insights, auditing, and data classification to Copilot Studio prompts and responses, and use familiar compliance capabilities like sensitivity labels, DLP, Insider Risk Management, Communication Compliance, eDiscovery, and Data Lifecycle Management to reduce oversharing risk and support investigations. For agents published to non-Microsoft channels, Purview management can require pay-as-you-go billing, while still using the same Purview policies and reporting workflows teams already rely on. Microsoft Foundry : Microsoft Purview integrates with Microsoft Foundry to help organizations secure and govern AI interactions (prompts, responses, and related metadata) using Microsoft’s unified data security and compliance capabilities. Once enabled through the Foundry Control Plane or through Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Microsoft Azure Portal, Purview can provide DSPM for AI posture insights plus auditing, data classification, sensitivity labels, and enforcement-oriented controls like DLP, along with downstream compliance workflows such as Insider Risk, Communication Compliance, eDiscovery, and Data Lifecycle Management. This lets security and compliance teams apply consistent policies across AI apps and agents in Foundry, while gaining visibility and governance through the same Purview portal and reports used across the enterprise. Conclusion When it comes to Copilot Studio vs. Azure AI Foundry , there is no universally “best” choice – the ideal platform depends on your team’s composition and project requirements. Copilot Studio excels at enabling functional business teams and IT pros to build AI assistants quickly in a managed, compliant environment with minimal coding. Azure AI Foundry shines for developer-centric projects that need maximal flexibility, custom code, and deep integration with enterprise systems. The key is to identify what level of control, speed, and skill your scenario calls for. Use both together to build end-to-end intelligent systems that combine ease of use with powerful backend intelligence. By thoughtfully aligning the platform to your team’s strengths and needs, you can minimize friction and maximize momentum on your AI agent journey delivering custom copilot solutions that are both quick to market and built for the long haul Resources to explore Copilot Studio Overview Microsoft Foundry Use Microsoft Purview to manage data security & compliance for Microsoft Copilot Studio Use Microsoft Purview to manage data security & compliance for Microsoft Foundry Optimize Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Credit costs with Microsoft Agent pre-purchase plan Accelerate Innovation with Microsoft Agent Factory",

    "title": "Why Arbor Edge Defense and CDN-Based DDoS protection are better together",
    "summary": "In today’s hyperconnected digital landscape, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have evolved into sophisticated, multivector threats capable of crippling even the most resilient infrastructures. While content delivery network (CDN)-based DDoS protection offers scalable mitigation for volumetric attacks, it’s not a silver bullet. To truly safeguard critical services and maintain operational continuity, organizations must adopt a multilayered defense strategy—and that’s where NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense (AED) comes in. The limitations of CDN-based DDoS protection CDN providers offer robust cloud-based DDoS mitigation that is effective against large-scale volumetric attacks. These services reroute traffic through global scrubbing centers, filtering out malicious traffic before it reaches the origin server. However, CDN-based solutions often fall short in detecting and mitigating: Low-volume, stealthy application-layer attacks Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) state exhaustion attacks Outbound threats from compromised internal hosts Attacks that bypass CDN routing (for example, direct-to-IP attacks) These gaps leave critical infrastructure vulnerable, especially when attackers use dynamic, multivector techniques designed to evade upstream defenses. Arbor Edge Defense: The first and last line of defense NETSCOUT’s AED is uniquely positioned between the internet router and the firewall, acting as an inline, always-on shield. AED uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-powered stateless packet processing and real-time threat intelligence from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS infrastructure, which monitors up to 50% of global internet traffic spanning more than 200 countries and territories and 398 industry verticals and representing two-thirds of the routable IP space. Key capabilities include: Automatic mitigation of all DDoS attack types, including encrypted traffic and Domain Name System (DNS) water torture attacks Protection against outbound threats, preventing data exfiltration, and botnet communications Firewall preservation, reducing operational load by as much as 80% Adaptive DDoS protection , which learns and adjusts to evolving attack patterns in real time The power of a hybrid approach Combining AED with CDN-based DDoS protection creates a defense-in-depth architecture that covers the full spectrum of attack vectors: Arbor Cloud DDoS protection handles high-volume attacks far from the target, preserving bandwidth and upstream resources AED provides surgical, on-premises mitigation for application-layer and state-exhaustion attacks that cloud solutions often miss Real-world impact According to IDC , 41% of organizations report that online attacks—including DDoS—have caused damages exceeding $100,000, with 5% suffering losses of more than $1 million. As attackers increasingly leverage AI to launch dynamic threats, organizations must respond with intelligent, automated defenses that adapt in real time. In isolation, CDN-based DDoS protection and Arbor Edge Defense each offer valuable capabilities. But together, they form a comprehensive, adaptive, and resilient security posture that’s essential for modern enterprises facing relentless cyberthreats. By integrating these solutions, organizations can ensure their networks remain available, secure, and performant—no matter what the threat landscape throws their way.

    "title": "Why cybersecurity needs to focus more on investigation and less on just detection and response",
    "summary": "When we think about cybersecurity, most of us picture alarms going off, software scanning for viruses, and firewalls keeping the bad guys out. Detection and response are the heavy lifters in any modern security strategy, and rightfully so. They help us spot threats, shut them down quickly, and get back to business. But here’s the catch: Focusing only on detection and response is like driving a car while looking only in the rearview mirror. You might see problems when they’ve already happened, but you miss the opportunity to understand what caused them and how to avoid them in the future. In cybersecurity, the investigation phase is where the real magic happens. It’s where you dig deeper, look beyond the surface, and ask the tough questions: How did this happen? Why did it work? What does this mean for the bigger picture? The truth is, too many organizations spend most of their time trying to detect and respond to threats without investing in the deeper understanding that comes with a thorough investigation. The problem with over-focusing on detection Imagine you’re dealing with a leak in your house. You notice the water rising, so you grab a mop and start cleaning up. But if you never investigate where the leak is coming from, it’s only a matter of time before the problem returns. In cybersecurity, detection is the mop, important for stopping immediate damage, but not a long-term solution. Detection tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls are crucial. They alert you to threats, catch malicious activities early, and help prevent disaster. But they are reactive by nature. They’re designed to find the known problems, the familiar patterns, the stuff that has already been spotted and documented. This is great for stopping the obvious things, such as hackers trying to brute-force their way into a system, but it’s not so effective against things that are more subtle or sophisticated. The real issue? Many of today’s most dangerous threats are the ones that don’t show up easily on detection radars. Think about the advanced persistent threats (APTs) that remain hidden for months or the zero-day attacks that exploit vulnerabilities no one even knew existed. These threats may slip right past the detection systems because they don’t act in obvious ways. That’s why, in these cases, detection alone isn’t enough. It’s just the first step. Investigation: Where the real insights lie This is where investigation comes in. Think of investigation as the part where you understand the full story. It’s like detective work: not just looking at the footprints, but figuring out where they came from, who’s leaving them, and why they’re trying to break in in the first place. You can’t stop a cyberattack with detection alone if you don’t understand what caused it or how it worked. And if you don’t know the cause, you can’t appropriately respond to the detected threat. An investigation looks at things such as: What vulnerabilities were exploited? How did the attackers gain access in the first place? What have they done once inside? What’s the long-term impact: did they steal data, or just cause chaos? By diving deep into packet -level data, investigators can paint a full picture of an attack, uncovering things that might not be immediately apparent. This level of understanding is essential for defending against future threats. It’s about learning from what happened, not just reacting to it. Why we miss it, and why we shouldn’t There’s a reason why so many organizations focus on detection and response. They’re easy to measure, and they provide quick, visible results. But here’s the thing: When we put all our effort into detecting and responding, we miss out on the bigger lessons that investigation can teach us. Take this analogy: Imagine trying to prevent a fire by only looking for smoke. If all you focus on is catching the smoke as it rises, you never find out where the fire started. Maybe it was a faulty wire or an unnoticed spark in the attic. You’re reacting, but you’re not solving the root cause. The same goes for cybersecurity. When we’re just detecting and responding, we may miss the true cause of the problem, which leaves us vulnerable to the same issues happening again. An investigation is the only way to uncover the weak points in your defenses, learn from your mistakes, and improve over time. The true cost of missing the investigation The cost of neglecting investigation goes beyond just missing a threat. It’s about missed opportunities for learning and growth. Every attack offers a lesson. By investigating the full scope of a breach, you gain insights that not only help in responding to that incident but also prepare you to defend against future ones. It’s about building resilience, not just reaction. Think about it: If you never investigate an incident thoroughly, you’re essentially ignoring the underlying risk that allowed the threat to flourish. You might fix the hole that was exploited, but you won’t have a clear understanding of why it was there in the first place. And next time, attackers might find a different way in. The bigger picture: Cybersecurity as a continuous learning process Here’s the deeper point: Cybersecurity is not about preventing every single attack; that’s an unrealistic goal. It’s about understanding your vulnerabilities, adapting, and getting better over time. Investigation is a tool for continuous improvement. The market has been laser-focused on detection and response, and for good reason. These are crucial in mitigating immediate risk. But they should be part of a broader, more reflective process that includes investigation, a phase that allows you to learn from the past and prepare for the future. In the long run, this is the real key to building a resilient security posture. Final thoughts: A shift in thinking As we look to the future of cybersecurity, it’s time for a shift in thinking. Instead of just reacting to threats, let’s focus on understanding them: investigating the root causes, uncovering patterns, and using those insights to strengthen our defenses. The goal should be not just to stop the attack, but to learn from it and build a better system going forward. If we can embrace this mindset, we’ll be far more prepared for the challenges ahead. After all, the best defense against tomorrow’s attack isn’t just detecting it when it happens. It’s understanding it before it even starts.

    "title": "5 myths about DDoS attacks and protection",
    "summary": "Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks come in many shapes and sizes, as do the myths surrounding them. These myths can center on motivations, DDoS attack vectors and techniques, mitigation strategies, and more. DDoS myths are also sometimes more dangerous than the attacks themselves because the misconceptions can leave organizations vulnerable to other types of cyberattacks, misguide mitigation strategies, or cause teams to miss attacks altogether. Let’s look at five of the top myths regarding DDoS attacks and protection and debunk them. Myth 1: DDoS attacks are uncommon, only target large corporations, and are carried out by sophisticated threat actors. In reality, DDoS attacks are very common, targeting businesses of all types and sizes. According to NETSCOUT’s ASERT research team , there were more than 15 million DDoS attacks worldwide in 2024. This level of activity shows that the threat of DDoS is alive and well, making defensive measures a must for companies of all shapes and sizes. Although nation-states carry out their own sophisticated DDoS attacks, many are carried out by low-cost or even free DDoS-for-hire services that utilize global botnets or groups of compromised devices. Often, the ones requesting DDoS-for-hire attacks are not sophisticated hackers but are acting on geopolitical events, going after companies, individuals, or infrastructure that go against their interests. DDoS attacks do not always target corporate networks. They often target infrastructure or key services, such as power grids, to profoundly impact the general population. Myth 2: DDoS attacks only involve flooding networks with large amounts of traffic. In the early days of DDoS, the vast majority of attacks were large traffic floods. However, DDoS attacks have evolved over time, becoming more surgically targeted and complex. The media continues to report on the largest, most shocking attacks that are terabits per second in size, reinforcing this common misconception. Although these large-scale attacks are still dangerous, most smaller attacks, under 1Gbps, are equally dangerous, targeting application layers such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and HTTP. In 2024, ASERT noted a 43% increase in smaller application-layer attacks compared with 2023, showing that these targeted assaults are rising in popularity. This is because many DDoS protection services provided by internet service providers (ISPs) and other cloud protection solutions look for large volumetric attacks and disregard the smaller attacks, which are passed on to the customer. Unless networks have some level of DDoS protection in place, these smaller attacks are more likely to be successful and can cause issues for businesses and their customers. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) state-exhaustion attacks are another common type of smaller attack. They specifically target stateful on-premises devices such as firewalls, load balancers, virtual private network (VPN) gateways, and more, and fill their state tables with bogus connections, blocking legitimate users from accessing areas of the network. Myth 3: Next-generation firewalls can stop DDoS attacks. Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are powerful devices that can greatly improve your overall security stance. However, their stateful design makes them vulnerable to several types of DDoS attacks, especially state-exhaustion attacks. Pairing NGFWs with a stateless DDoS mitigation solution placed in front of the firewall protects firewalls from state-exhaustion attacks. Myth 4: Cloud-based DDoS protection alone is enough. When a DDoS attack is larger than your internet pipe, the only way to stop it is with cloud-based DDoS protection . That said, smaller attacks can slip past these protections, necessitating additional defensive measures. Modern DDoS attacks leverage multiple attack vectors to bypass defenses. This means they can pair a volumetric attack or state-exhaustion attack with an application-layer attack to target multiple areas of the network, making it harder to detect and mitigate. By deploying a hybrid approach to DDoS defense, pairing cloud-based and on-premises inline DDoS protection solutions , organizations can better protect against agile, multivector DDoS onslaughts, maximizing uptime and availability. Myth 5: DDoS protection does not require the use of AI/ML. Many believe that leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) is not necessary in defending against DDoS attacks. That could not be further from the truth. First, attackers are using AI/ML to multiply attack volumes, increase sophistication, and avoid detection. This means that defensive measures must think the same way, leveraging the traffic anomaly detection capabilities of AI/ML to find abnormalities in traffic patterns that signify DDoS threats. AI/ML can take the form of curated threat intelligence feeds that automatically block known, active DDoS threats in real time. With this threat intelligence constantly updated, the latest threats are no match for AI/ML-powered DDoS defenses. AI/ML can also automate real-time countermeasure adjustments to defend against multivector attacks. DDoS attacks and protection Myths have no place in protecting your network’s most important digital assets. Don’t fall victim to these common myths. Dedicated DDoS protection that defends against dynamic multivector DDoS attacks is the only true way to assure maximum uptime in the modern DDoS landscape.

    "title": "Announcing AI Entity Analyzer in Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server - Public Preview",
    "summary": "What is the Entity Analyzer ? Assessing the risk of entities is a core task for SOC teams - whether triaging incidents, investigating threats, or automating response workflows. Traditionally, this has required building complex playbooks or custom logic to gather and analyze fragmented security data from multiple sources. With Entity Analyzer, this complexi ty starts to fade away. The tool leverages your organization’s security data in Sentinel to deliver comprehensive, reasoned risk assessments for any entity you encounter - starting with users and urls. By providing this unified, out-of-the-box solution for entity analysis, Entity Analyzer also enables the AI agents you build to make smarter decisions and automate more tasks - without the need to manually engineer risk evaluation logic for each entity type. And for those building SOAR workflows, Entity Analyzer is natively integrated with Logic Apps, making it easy to enrich incidents and automate verdicts within your playbooks. *Entity Analyzer is rolling out in Public Preview to Sentinel MCP server and within Logic Apps starting today. Learn more here . Deep Dive: H ow the User Analyzer is already solving problems for security teams Problem: Drowning in i dentity a lerts Security operations centers (SOCs) are inundated with identity-based threats and alert noise. Triaging these alerts requires analyzing numerous data sources across sign-in logs, cloud app events, identity info, behavior analytics, threat intel, and more, all in tandem with each other to reach a verdict - something very challenging to do without a human in the loop today. So, we introduced the User Analyzer, a specialized analyzer that unifies, correlates, and analyzes user activity across all these security data sources. Government of Nunavut: solving identity alert overload with User Analyzer Hear the below from Arshad Sheikh, Security Expert at Government of Nunavut, on how they're using the User Analyzer today: How it's making a difference \"Before the User Analyzer, when we received identity alerts we had to check a large amount of data related to users’ activity (user agents, anomalies, IP reputation, etc.). We had to write queries, wait for them to run , and then manually reason over the results . We attempted to automate some of this , but maintaining and updating that retrieval, parsing, and reasoning automation was difficult and we didn’t have the resources to support it. With the User Analyzer , we now have a plug-and-play solution that represents a step toward the AI-driven automation of the future. It gathers all the context such as what the anomalies are and presents it to our analysts so they can make quick, confident decisions , eliminating the time previously spent manually gathering this data from portals.\" Solving a real problem \"For example, every 24 hours we create a low severity incident of our users who successfully sign-in to our network non interactively from outside of our GEO fence . This type of activity is not high-enough fidelity to auto-disable, requiring us to manually analyze the flagged users each time. But with User Analyzer, this analysis is performed automatically . The User Analyzer has also significantly reduced the time required to determine whether identity-based incidents like these are false positives or true positives . Instead of spending around 20 minutes investigating each incident, our analysts can now reach a conclusion in about 5 minutes using the automatically generated summary.\" Looking ahead \" Looking ahead , we see even more potential. In the future, the User Analyzer could be integrated directly with Microsoft Sentinel playbooks to take automated, definitive action such as blocking user or device access based on the analyzer’s results . This would further streamline our incident response and move us closer to fully automated security operations.\" Want similar benefits in your SOC? Get started with our Entity Analyzer Logic Apps template here . User Analy zer architecture : how does it work? Let’s take a look at how the User Analyzer works. The User Analyzer aggregates and correlates signals from multiple data sources to deliver a comprehensive analysis , enabling informed actions based on user activity. The diagram below gives an overview of this architecture: Step 1: Retrieve Data The analyzer starts by retrieving relevant data from the following sources: Sign-In Logs (Interactive & Non-Interactive) : Tracks authentication and login activity. Security Alerts : Alerts from Microsoft Defender solutions. Behavior Analytics : Surfaces behavioral anomalies through advanced analytics. Cloud App Events : Captures activity from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Identity Information : Enriches user context with identity records. Microsoft Threat Intelligence : Enriches IP addresses with Microsoft Threat Intelligence. Steps 2: C orrelat e signals Signals are correlated using identifiers such as user IDs, IP addresses, and threat intelligence. Rather than treating each alert or behavior in isolation, the User Analyzer fuses signals to build a holistic risk profile. Step 3: AI- b ased reasoning In the User Analyzer, multiple AI-powered agents collaborate to evaluate the evidence and reach consensus. This architecture not only improves accuracy and reduces bias in verdicts, but also provides transparent, justifiable decisions. Leveraging AI within the User Analyzer introduces a new dimension of intelligence to threat detection. Instead of relying on static signatures or rigid regex rules, AI-based reasoning can uncover subtle anomalies that traditional detection methods and automation playbooks often miss . For example, an attacker might try to evade detection by slightly altering a user-agent string or by targeting and exfiltrating only a few files of specific types. While these changes could bypass conventional pattern matching, an AI-powered analyzer understands the semantic context and behavioral patterns behind these artifacts, allowing it to flag suspicious deviations even when the syntax looks benign. Step 4: V erdict & analysis Each user is given a verdict. The analyzer outputs any of the following verdicts based on the analysis: Compromised Suspicious activity found No evidence of compromise Based on the verdict, a corresponding recommendation is given. This helps teams make an informed decision whether action should be taken against the user. *AI-generated content from the User Analyzer may be incorrect - check it for accuracy. User Analyzer Example Output See the following example output from the user analyzer within an incident comment: This screenshot shows how the analysis would appear within an incident's comments section. See the below pictures for a zoomed-in view of the analysis text. *IP addresses have been redacted for this blog* This screenshot shows the analyzer's top-level classification that a user account is compromised along with its supporting evidence, starting with the series of alerts and their associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques, a list of malicious IP addresses the user signed in from (redacted for this blog) , and a few suspicious user agents the user's activity originated from. This screenshot shows the rest of the supporting evidence (the remaining suspicious user agents and a list of anomalous behavior). By providing these pieces of evidence, the analyzer can make security analysts, who typically have to query and analyze these themselves, feel more comfortable trusting its classification. The analyzer also gives recommendations to remediate the account compromise, and a list of data sources it used during analysis. Conclusion Entity Analyzer in Microsoft Sentinel MCP server represents a leap forward in alert triage & analysis. By correlating signals and harnessing AI-based reasoning, it empowers SOC teams to act on investigations with greater speed, precision, and confidence.",

    "title": "Supercharge your Cloud SQL for MySQL write performance with new optimized writes",
    "summary": "Tuning MySQL instances for write-intensive workloads is a persistent engineering challenge. Cloud SQL for MySQL Enterprise Plus edition now includes optimized writes , a set of automated features that adjust MySQL configurations based on real-time workload and infrastructure metrics. This reduces write latency and increases throughput without manual intervention. All Enterprise Plus edition instances have this feature enabled by default. This post details the underlying optimizations and provides a reproducible benchmark to measure the performance improvements. Inside Cloud SQL for MySQL optimized writes The optimized writes feature includes five different optimizations that all automatically tune MySQL parameters, flags, and data handling, in order to optimize write performance based on instance and workload needs. Here’s a little more about how each component of optimized writes works: Feature What it does Adaptive purge Cloud SQL dynamically adjusts innodb_purge_threads to prioritize user workloads over routine database maintenance operations. Adaptive I/O limits Cloud SQL dynamically adjusts I/O parameters, specifically innodb_io_capacity and innodb_io_capacity_max. This adjustment occurs in direct response to fluctuations in workload demands and prevents I/O bottlenecks during traffic spikes. Scalable sharded I/O Cloud SQL implements I/O sharding by distributing load across multiple mutexes to enhance I/O throughput and accommodate demanding workloads. Faster REDO recovery Cloud SQL optimizes the handling of temporary data and the expedited flushing of dirty pages, consequently reducing recovery times and enabling the utilization of larger redo logs. Adaptive buffer pool warmup Cloud SQL dynamically uses available disk I/O capacity to accelerate data cache warmup by scheduling page reads, resulting in faster data cache warmup post instance restart and a reduction in performance variance. We've observed that with optimized writes, Cloud SQL for MySQL Enterprise Plus now delivers up to 3x better write throughput when compared to its Enterprise edition counterpart, while reducing latency significantly. These optimizations are most effective for write-intensive OLTP workloads and results can vary based on machine configurations. For workloads that are primarily read, Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition also provides an integrated SSD-backed data cache option, enabling up to 3x higher read throughput , as detailed in our initial launch blog . Testing the optimized write performance improvement Now that you're aware of the exceptional write performance offered by Cloud SQL for MySQL Enterprise Plus edition, you might be curious about its potential impact within your own environment. Measuring this performance enhancement can be done with the sysbench benchmarking tool. You can follow the steps below and adjust specific machine configuration parameters to conduct testing tailored to your typical workloads. Step 1: Create database instances To help study the performance improvement, first create three different class of machines: Enterprise edition (ee) Enterprise Plus edition (ee+) without optimized writes Enterprise Plus edition (ee+) with optimized writes code_block )])]> Step 2: Create client Next, create a VM for the client instance. Client instances are placed in the same region but different zone. code_block )])]> Then, log in to the client instances and execute following commands to install sysbench and mysqladmin: code_block --zone us-central1-a'), ('language', ''), ('caption', )])]> code_block )])]> Step 3: Run the benchmarking workload Finally, you can run the sysbench write benchmark using the following script: code_block )])]> code_block )])]> Upon completion, you will observe the throughput and latency results from the three Cloud SQL instances created in Step 1. These results should demonstrate the performance advantages of the Enterprise Plus edition and further improvements brought by optimized writes. Please note that performance outcomes can fluctuate and may vary based on specific machine configurations. Ready to enable optimized writes? All existing and newly created instances have optimized writes enabled by default, so upgrade your Cloud SQL instances to Enterprise Plus edition today to experience the performance improvement!",

    "title": "Stress caused by cybersecurity threats is taking its toll",
    "summary": "As cyber threats become more frequent and more complex, they’re causing visible, measurable damage to organizations’ reputations and bottom lines. But the damage doesn’t end there. Breaches — or at least the threat of them — are impacting the mental health of companies’ IT and security workforces. According to new data, IT and security workers are facing nothing less than a mental health crisis in the workforce. Object First’s recent survey of 500 IT and security professionals revealed that 84% feel uncomfortably stressed at work due to IT security risks. The survey went on to report that 78% fear they will be personally blamed for security incidents regardless of the circumstances. These numbers should alarm any CSO whose staff are responsible for keeping cyber threats from taking our systems down. The corporate sector rightly puts a premium on creating positive, productive cultures to help staff thrive and do their best work. But this latest data shows that workers are on edge and worried about repercussions from the threats IT breaches pose. Other numbers in the same survey should trigger even louder alarms. Nearly three-fifths of all cyber/IT workers say they have considered or have actively begun looking for new jobs due to the pressures of their role. In addition, nearly half report feeling pressure from leadership to “fix everything” in the aftermath of a security incident, while nearly one in five (18%) say they feel “hopeless and overwhelmed” during and after an incident. As a Field CTO who works closely with security teams to set them up for success, this data gives me chills. So many of our best professionals feel threatened enough by cyber stress to walk out the door and look for a new job. This is more than an HR nightmare; it’s a business resilience challenge. Burnout is intensifying Any CSO or CISO knows that burnout in the cybersecurity sector is not a brand-new topic. As far back as the early 2000s, when cyber evolved into a formal discipline, leaders were talking openly about the stress security pros were feeling, having to be “always on.” Over the next two decades, surveys found that a majority of security personnel felt burned out and many considered leaving the field. While the issue isn’t new, recent reports confirm that burnout in our sector seems to be intensifying. “Cybersecurity professionals at all levels are burning out. Our research shows this is only getting worse,” says Jon Oltsik, former industry analyst and author of the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)’s seventh annual “Life and Times of Security Professionals” report . The ISSA survey said cyber workers’ jobs are getting harder, citing increased complexity and workload, more threats and larger attack surface, regulatory compliance pressures and understaffing as their top stressors. The report also indicates the vast majority (81%) of respondents who said they are under stress considered leaving their jobs on a regular basis, versus 17% of those satisfied with their roles. Gartner also weighed in on the topic earlier this year, listing cybersecurity burnout as one of the six top cybersecurity trends of 2025 . “Cybersecurity burnout and its organizational impact must be recognized and addressed to ensure cybersecurity program effectiveness,” said Alex Michaels, senior principal analyst at Gartner. “The most effective SRM leaders are not only prioritizing their own stress management, but they are also investing in teamwide wellbeing initiatives that demonstrably improve personal resilience.” Finding qualified cybersecurity workers is still a difficult task. Hiring a new IT or security professional typically costs one and a half to two times their predecessor’s annual salary, and up to 28% of all cyber jobs remain unfilled, a ccording to the Boston Consulting Group’s “ 2024 Cybersecurity Workforce Report: Bridging the Workforce Shortage and Skills Gap .” It’s hard enough to match the skills a trusted, talented security professional possesses. It’s impossible — at least in the short term — to replace the institutional knowledge that same professional gains working inside your organization, helping to fend off IT threats for a significant amount of time. The roots of cyber stress Cyber employees can feel pressure for a number of reasons. Many sense they have to maintain a constant state of vigilance to spot any phishing, ransomware and social engineering threats that come in. Many fear that one wrong click — by them or by a colleague — could compromise the company and put their job at risk. Others feel a sense of “compliance overload,” having to deal with repeated password changes, MFA steps and security awareness training. More than half of the respondents to the Object First survey said their heavy workloads and understaffed teams contributed the most stress, followed by concerns about cyberattacks and the pressure to maintain uptime and service availability. Nearly everybody (85%) experienced security-related stress at some level, while 31% said they face consistent stress at least once a week. This kind of sustained stress saps motivation, causes mental fatigue, triggers physical health issues and generally reduces workers’ sense of purpose to the point where it hurts their overall performance. Stressed, fatigued workers are more likely to make mistakes and put organizations at greater risk of breaches and security. Companies that prioritize employee wellbeing and mental health stand the best chance of solving this issue. Problem is, not everybody is doing so. According to the Object First survey, 50% of IT and security employees felt their companies aren’t doing enough to deal with the growing mental health crisis. CSOs certainly can’t solve the burnout issue alone. Companies need to make cybersecurity burnout a priority issue for their boards and for the C-suite as a whole. But CSOs and CIOs to have an important role to play. Here are some moves they can make to lower the pressure their staff are feeling. Build a safe culture : Protecting an organization from cyber incidents is a scary process, and employees are facing constant fear that incidents will escalate and they’ll get blamed. CSOs should set up processes where escalation is encouraged and post-incident discussions focus on ways the whole team can improve. Celebrating early detection, and not just incident containment, will improve performance and lessen tensions. Reduce the noise : Burnout can often be caused by structural issues that are out of line: too much work, too little staffing, too much noise from unfiltered alerts, faulty systems and too much pressure from being on call. CSOs should review operations and practices to make sure staff aren’t overloaded with work or focused too heavily on reactive tasks. Provide resources : Stress can take a toll on mental health. While HR should take the lead in providing mental-health and resilience programs, CSOs should provide guidance and watch for signs that employees need individualized attention. Make sure team members feel “seen” : Recognition — in the form of awards or just shared discussions of work done well — can go a long way to reducing long-term, collective stress. Some CSOs set up regular 1:1 meetings or group sessions they encourage cyber workers to share examples of stressful situations on the job. When CSOs see employees heading toward burnout, nudging them to unplug and recharge can often lower stress to a manageable level. The cybersecurity mental health crisis is real. The pressure to be the last line of cyber defense is taking a serious toll on professionals’ mental health and job performance, and it’s time to provide them with more support. CSOs can send a powerful message that well-being isn’t optional — it’s essential for businesses to stay resilient in the face of more frequent, complex cyber threats.

India has also demanded that X restrict Grok’s ability to generate “obscene, pornographic or pedophilic” images within 72 hours, or risk losing its legal protection against user-generated content. Grok, developed by Musk’s company xAI and hosted on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, has published a message in which it “apologizes” for creating and sharing an AI image of two girls aged 12-16 in sexual poses. However, critics say that a system like Grok cannot be held truly accountable, making the apology meaningless. Elon Musk writes on X that users who produce illegal content through Grok will be treated as if they uploaded it themselves.

    "title": "Questions I've Been Asked",
    "summary": "Sometimes I'll get questions via different routes...webinars or podcasts, via social media, DM, or even email. Getting questions is good, because it keeps me aware that I'm in somewhat of a bubble, given the work I do and the environment in which I do it. Given the nature of \"social\" media (hint: it's rarely \"social\"), it's tough to draw a bead on where you are at any given moment, so questions can be invaluable. Here's an interesting question I got from Brian Carrier during a webinar he invited me to... If you have the entire Registry and limited time, what do you do? The Cyber Triage LinkedIn post has 9 pages, and as you can see from the first one, my answer to the above question is: I cheat. For me, it's pretty simple. Beginning with the second slide from that LinkedIn post, I explain what I mean by \" I cheat \". I have my parsing tools (which I've shared ), and I enrich or \"decorate\" the output based on what I've seen on previous engagements, or gathered from write-ups and information shared online. For example, this recent blog post references a write up that describes how Valley RAT stores configuration information and plugins with a specific Registry path. Rather than parsing the entire Registry and looking through that massive amount of information, hoping that I'll remember the Registry path mentioned, I write a plugin that searches for it specifically, and alerts me if it's found. That way, not only do I not have to remember a ton of paths, keys and values, I now have a documented plugin with a publish (and update) date, links/URLs pointing to online references, etc. As many who use RegRipper are aware, I've including Analysis Notes in plugins, describing what to look for, and how the output of the plugin can be used. In addition, almost 2 1/2 yrs ago, I got Yara running via RegRipper , as well, significantly expanding the capabilities of both tool sets. So, in a way, I'm \"cheating\" by leveraging a unique capability. Here's a question I received via email recently, from someone who was reading Investigating Windows Systems : How does your methodology change when you are investigating a domain controller or server versus a typical workstation? My answer was, for the the most part...it doesn't. Yes, artifacts may vary depending upon the nature of the endpoint (i.e., server vs workstation, Windows 11, etc.) and what's installed, but the methodology generally doesn't change, unless my analysis goals change. And I've used the same essential methodology for almost 2 decades now, expanding and developing it along the way. Another question: When will you write a book on Linux forensics? Yes, I actually received this question, and not just recently. And I've received it before. Look, there's nothing to indicate, anywhere, that I know enough about performing forensics on Linux systems to write a book, let alone a blog post. I did just talk to someone yesterday (I was serving as a greeter at church) about a Xenix firewall I examined years ago; I was able to image the hard drive, and then open the image in EnCase, but I had no idea where to begin with analysis, particularly given that logging appeared to have been disabled. Also, there are a LOT of books available on the topic already, so why would I want to put in the effort and expense to just become part of the background noise? Here's another question I've received a number of times over the years: Where can I find a list of free images from real incidents? This one is easy. First, it's unlikely that you're going to find images...disk, memory, triage...from \"real\" incidents anywhere online. If you do, please let me know. I've been aware of images shared for some time that are contrived scenarios and/or part of CTFs, but I can't image someone would share an image, even a triage collection, from a real, live incident. If you know of someone who did, and the link is still valid, I'd love it if you could share it. Second, I've posted lists of available images multiple times in this blog, the most recent of which can be found here .",

    "title": "Announcing public preview: Uncovering hidden threats with the Dynamic Threat Detection Agent",
    "summary": "At Ignite, we announced the Security Copilot Dynamic Threat Detection Agent in Microsoft Defender: an always on, adaptive backend agent that uncovers hidden threats across Defender and Microsoft Sentinel environments. Today we are excited to share that the customers who meet the prerequisites will now enter public preview of this agent. Running in the Defender backend, the agent delivers Copilot-sourced alerts directly into familiar workflows—complete with natural language explanations, mapped MITRE techniques, and tailored remediation steps. Why adaptive AI-driven detection changes the game Traditional rule-based and machine learning (ML) systems struggle to keep pace with ever-evolving threats. Attackers now leverage AI to evade detection, leaving organizations exposed. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent addresses this through: Adaptive AI that finds what rules miss – GenAI-driven detection continuously investigates across Defender and Sentinel telemetry to uncover false negatives and blind spots, providing always-on protection with clear risk context and concrete next steps (see Figure 1 below). Reduce noise, increase confidence – The agent minimizes SOC noise and boosts analyst confidence, with customer-validated precision above 85% in recent months across thousands of alerts and 28 threat types (e.g., Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement). Hyperscale TI + UEBA driven entity risk scoring – The agent fuses Threat Intelligence Tracking via Adaptive Networks (TITAN) ’s hyperscale, ML-driven threat intelligence with UEBA risk signals to continuously score accounts, devices, and IPs. This combination of global TI, customer-specific context, and behavioral anomalies surfaces genuinely risky behaviors earlier while filtering noise and providing key context during the agent’s investigations. Always on, zero-touch—with customer control – Because the agent runs in the Defender backend, it automatically generates alerts into your existing XDR workflows with no tuning or onboarding required. During public preview it’s enabled by default for eligible customers, and starting in July it will be available for E5 customers through the Security Copilot inclusion . Once billing begins, customers can disable it at any time and manage usage through detailed consumption reporting. Deep integration across the Microsoft security ecosystem – The agent works with Security Copilot, Sentinel, and Defender, correlating native and third-party telemetry to surface missed behaviors and deliver richer context across your SOC workflows. Figure 1. Clicking into the Dynamic Threat Detection alert reveals key details such as its classification, detection source, and a ‘What Happened’ summary. This description explains the detection logic behind the alert and why it’s relevant to the organization. Inside the Dynamic Threat Detection engine Under the hood, the Dynamic Threat Detection Agent runs a five-step investigation loop at machine scale—starting from signals you already care about, building a rich activity timeline, testing hypotheses, and closing detection gaps with explainable, actionable alerts. This loop executes across thousands of parallel investigations, delivering detections in near–real time for your SOC. Start with an incident – Running continuously in the Defender backend, the agent monitors for security activity you care about: incidents with a high priority score , critical assets, disruption signals, threat actor notifications, and more. Build a focused timeline – From that incident, it builds a unified activity timeline that stitches together alerts, events, UEBA anomalies, and threat intelligence. Iterative Q/A loop – Given the incident and its unified timeline, the agent automatically generates attack-specific hypotheses (e.g., “Was this account compromised via phishing from this IP?” ) and runs its own chain of targeted questions over relevant entities and events. Without any manual prompts or intervention, the agent investigates its hypotheses, rules out alternate explanations, and autonomously converges on a single, well-supported triage decision with an explicit, transparent reasoning trace. Close detection gaps with explainable, actionable alerts – When evidence converges on a true positive, the agent automatically emits a dynamic alert—complete with title, description, severity, mapped MITRE techniques, and remediation steps—directly into your Defender workflows with Security Copilot as the detection source. Alongside the structured fields, the agent generates a natural language narrative that explains why the activity is risky, which entities and signals drove the decision, and how the attack unfolded, giving analysts a transparent window into its reasoning. Learn and improve continuously – Your grading feedback (TP/FP/BP) is leveraged to recalibrate seed points, refine table selection, tune hypothesis questions, and adjust thresholds so detection quality improves over time. This feedback continuously sharpens the agent’s ability to detect meaningful threats and reduce alert noise. Answering the questions security experts ask first Before adopting a new detection capability, security teams want more than features—they want clear answers on noise, effort, cost, explainability, and how it fits with their existing tools and compliance posture. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent is built with those questions in mind, so from day one you know how it behaves in your SOC, how it’s governed, and what value it delivers. What’s the value? The agent uncovers hidden threats (i.e., false negative alerts), enriching investigations with context so analysts can resolve incidents faster and with greater confidence. Will this add noise? The agent is tuned for high precision—measured at 85+% over the past few months across thousands of alerts and numerous threat types (e.g., Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement). How much effort is required? Zero setup—it runs in the Defender backend and delivers alerts into your current workflows. What about cost and control? Public Preview is free for Security Copilot customers. At General Availability (July 2026), the agent transitions to the Security Copilot SCU-based model; you’ll have consumption reporting and the ability to disable the agent if desired. Microsoft Security Copilot is now included for all eligible Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Learn more . Is it explainable? Every alert includes a custom description, mapped MITRE techniques, and tailored remediation actions. Alongside the structured fields, it generates a natural language narrative that explains why the activity is risky, which entities and signals drove the decision, and how the attack unfolded, giving analysts a transparent window into the agent’s reasoning Does it respect data residency? The service runs region local, ensuring that customer data and required telemetry stay inside the designated geographic boundary. How does it fit with Sentinel and Security Copilot? The agent uses Sentinel to correlate third-party and native telemetry, and runs as part of the Security Copilot platform—surfacing its alerts as Copilot-sourced detections in Defender. How fast and at what scale? The agent is built for massive scale with Azure Synapse, capable of running thousands of parallel investigations and delivering detections in near–real time for your SOC. The future of dynamic threat detection in your SOC The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent is a milestone in adaptive security—bringing GenAI to detection at scale, integrated across Defender and Sentinel, and delivered through Security Copilot. We’re just getting started: expect continued enhancements in coverage, contextual explainability, and integration with your SOC workflows. Public Preview starts now. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent is available as a free Public Preview for Security Copilot customers. General Availability (GA) planned for late 2026, the agent will transition to the Security Copilot SCU-based consumption model. Microsoft Security Copilot is now included for all eligible Microsoft 365 E5 customers, and this agent will be included as part of that entitlement.

    "title": "Simplify VM OS agent management at scale: Introducing VM Extensions Manager",
    "summary": "If you're an IT administrator, you know that managing Operating System (OS) agents (Google calls them extensions) across a large fleet of VM instances can be complex and frustrating. Indeed, this operational overhead can be a major barrier to adopting extension-based services on VM fleets, despite the fact that they unlock powerful application-level capabilities. To solve this problem, we’re excited to announce the preview of VM Extensions Manager , a new capability integrated directly into the Compute Engine API that simplifies installing and managing these Google-provided extensions. VM Extensions Manager provides a centralized, policy-driven framework for managing the entire lifecycle of Google Cloud extensions on your VM instances. Instead of relying on manual scripts, startup scripts, or other bespoke solutions, you can now define a policy to ensure all your VM instances — both existing and new — conform to that state, reducing operational overhead from months to hours. How to get started with VM Extensions Manager VM Extensions Manager is integrated directly into the compute.googleapis.com API, meaning there are no new APIs to discover or enable. You can get started in minutes. 1. Define your extension policy First, define a policy that specifies the desired state of your extensions. For the preview, you can create zonal policies at the Project level . This policy targets VM instances within a single, specific zone. Over the coming months, we’ll expand support to include global policies , as well as policies at the Organization and Folder levels . This will allow you to build a flexible hierarchy of policies (using priorities) to manage your extension on your enterprise fleet from a single control plane. You can create this policy directly from the Google Cloud console: Demo of Creating VM Extension policy using Cloud Console 2. Select your extensions In the policy, you select the Google Cloud extensions you want to manage. For the preview, VM Extensions Manager supports several critical Google Cloud extensions, including: Cloud Ops Agent (ops-agent): The Ops Agent is the primary agent for collecting telemetry from your Compute Engine instances. Agent for SAP (sap-extension): Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is provided by Google Cloud for the support and monitoring of SAP workloads running on Compute Engine instances and Bare Metal Solution servers. Agent for Compute Workload (workload-extension): The Agent for Compute Workloads lets you monitor and evaluate workloads running on Compute Engine. We'll be adding support for more extension-based services in the coming months. You can choose to pin a specific extension version or, keep it empty (the default) to get the latest extension installed. If you choose the default, VM Extensions Manager automatically handles the rollout of new versions as they are released — no more waiting to access new features and improvements. 3. Roll out global policy with more control VM Extensions Manager gives you control over how global policy changes are deployed across many zones with rollout speeds. Zonal policies don't offer rollout speeds; they are enforced instantaneously when the VMs are online. In coming weeks, we will expand support for global policy via gcloud first and update the documentation with relevant information. UI updates will follow in coming months. At preview, however, global policy lets you select two distinct rollout speeds: SLOW (Recommended): This is the default option, designed for safety. It orchestrates a zone-by-zone rollout (within the scope of the policy) with a built-in wait time between waves, minimizing the potential blast radius of a problematic change over a period of time, by default 5 days. This is perfect for standard maintenance and updates. FAST : This option eliminates the wait time between waves, executing the change across the entire fleet across zones as quickly as possible. It is intended for urgent use cases, such as deploying a critical security patch in a \"break-glass\" emergency scenario across all VMs in all zones. Once you save the policy, VM Extensions Manager takes over. The underlying progressive rollout engine manages the complex orchestration, and you can monitor its progress. A flexible system for standardization and control VM Extensions Manager is designed to bring standardization and control to extensions on your VM fleets. You can start today by applying zonal policies to your projects to ensure extensions are correctly installed on VM instances in the correct zones. To get started defining Extension policies for your Compute Engine VM instances, read the documentation to create your first policy. We're excited to see how you use VM Extensions Manager to standardize, secure, and simplify the management of your VM fleet.",

    "title": "Analysis of PPPP “encryption”",
    "summary": "My first article on the PPPP protocol already said everything there was to say about PPPP “encryption” : Keys are static and usually trivial to extract from the app. No matter how long the original key, it is mapped to an effective key that’s merely four bytes long. The “encryption” is extremely susceptible to known-plaintext attacks, usually allowing reconstruction of the effective key from a single encrypted packet. So this thing is completely broken, why look any further? There is at least one situation where you don’t know the app being used so you cannot extract the key and you don’t have any traffic to analyze either. It’s when you are trying to scan your local network for potential hidden cameras . This script will currently only work for cameras using plaintext communication. Other cameras expect a properly encrypted “LAN search” packet and will ignore everything else. How can this be solved without listing all possible keys in the script? By sending all possible ciphertexts of course! TL;DR: What would be completely ridiculous with any reasonable protocol turned out to be quite possible with PPPP. There are at most 157,092 ways in which a “LAN search” packet can be encrypted. I’ve opened a pull request to have the PPPP device detection script adjusted. Note : Cryptanalysis isn’t my topic, I am by no means an expert here. These issues are simply too obvious. Contents Mapping keys to effective keys Redundancies within the effective key ASCII to the rescue How large is n? How many ciphertexts is that? Understanding the response Mapping keys to effective keys The key which is specified as part of the app’s “init string” is not being used for encryption directly. Nor is it being fed into any of the established key stretching algorithms. Instead, a key represented by the byte sequence b 1 , b 2 , … , b n b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n is mapped to four bytes k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 that become the effective key. These bytes are calculated as follows ( ⌊ x ⌋ \\lfloor x \\rfloor means rounding down, ⊗ \\otimes stands for the bitwise XOR operation): k 1 = ( b 1 + b 2 + … + b n ) m o d 256 k 2 = ( − b 1 + − b 2 + … + − b n ) m o d 256 k 3 = ( ⌊ b 1 ÷ 3 ⌋ + ⌊ b 2 ÷ 3 ⌋ + … + ⌊ b n ÷ 3 ⌋ ) m o d 256 k 4 = b 1 ⊗ b 2 ⊗ … ⊗ b n \\begin{aligned} k_1 &= (b_1 + b_2 + \\ldots + b_n) \\mod 256\\\\ k_2 &= (-b_1 + -b_2 + \\ldots + -b_n) \\mod 256\\\\ k_3 &= (\\lfloor b_1 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\lfloor b_2 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\ldots + \\lfloor b_n \\div 3 \\rfloor) \\mod 256\\\\ k_4 &= b_1 \\otimes b_2 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes b_n \\end{aligned} In theory, a 4 byte long effective key means 256 4 = 4,294,967,296 256^4 = 4{,}294{,}967{,}296 possible values. But that would only be the case if these bytes were independent of each other. Redundancies within the effective key Of course the bytes of the effective key are not independent. This is most obvious with k 2 k_2 which is completely determined by k 1 k_1 : k 2 = ( − b 1 + − b 2 + … + − b n ) m o d 256 = − ( b 1 + b 2 + … + b n ) m o d 256 = − k 1 m o d 256 \\begin{aligned} k_2 &= (-b_1 + -b_2 + \\ldots + -b_n) \\mod 256\\\\ &= -(b_1 + b_2 + \\ldots + b_n) \\mod 256\\\\ &= -k_1 \\mod 256 \\end{aligned} This means that we can ignore k 2 k_2 , bringing the number of possible effective keys down to 256 3 = 16,777,216 256^3 = 16{,}777{,}216 . Now let’s have a look at the relationship between k 1 k_1 and k 4 k_4 . Addition and bitwise XOR operations are very similar, the latter merely ignores carry. This difference affects all the bits of the result but the lowest one, no carry to be considered here. This means that the lowest bits of k 1 k_1 and k 4 k_4 are always identical. So k 4 k_4 has only 128 possible values for any value of k 1 k_1 , bringing the total number of effective keys down to 256 ⋅ 256 ⋅ 128 = 8,388,608 256 \\cdot 256 \\cdot 128 = 8{,}388{,}608 . And that’s how far we can get considering only redundancies. It can be shown that a key can be constructed resulting in any combination of k 1 k_1 and k 3 k_3 values. Similarly, it can be shown that any combination of k 1 k_1 and k 4 k_4 is possible as long as the lowest bit is identical. ASCII to the rescue But the keys we are dealing with here aren’t arbitrary bytes. These aren’t limited to alphanumeric characters, some keys also contain punctuation, but they are all invariably limited to the ASCII range. And that means that the highest bit is never set in any of the b i b_i values. Which in turn means that the highest bit is never set in k 4 k_4 due to the nature of the bitwise XOR operation. We can once again rule out half of the effective keys, for any given value of k 1 k_1 there are only 64 possible values of k 4 k_4 . We now have 256 ⋅ 256 ⋅ 64 = 4,194,304 256 \\cdot 256 \\cdot 64 = 4{,}194{,}304 possible effective keys. How large is n? Now let’s have a thorough look at how k 3 k_3 relates to k 1 k_1 , ignoring the modulo operation at first. We are taking one third of each byte, rounding it down and summing that up. What if we were to sum up first and round down at the end, how would that relate? Well, it definitely cannot be smaller than rounding down in each step, so we have an upper bound here. ⌊ b 1 ÷ 3 ⌋ + ⌊ b 2 ÷ 3 ⌋ + … + ⌊ b n ÷ 3 ⌋ ≤ ⌊ ( b 1 + b 2 + … + b n ) ÷ 3 ⌋ \\lfloor b_1 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\lfloor b_2 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\ldots + \\lfloor b_n \\div 3 \\rfloor \\leq \\lfloor (b_1 + b_2 + \\ldots + b_n) \\div 3 \\rfloor How much smaller can the left side get? Each time we round down this removes at most two thirds, and we do this n n times. So altogether these rounding operations reduce the result by at most n ⋅ 2 ÷ 3 n \\cdot 2 \\div 3 . This gives us a lower bound: ⌈ ( b 1 + b 2 + … + b n − n ⋅ 2 ) ÷ 3 ⌉ ≤ ⌊ b 1 ÷ 3 ⌋ + ⌊ b 2 ÷ 3 ⌋ + … + ⌊ b n ÷ 3 ⌋ \\lceil (b_1 + b_2 + \\ldots + b_n - n \\cdot 2) \\div 3 \\rceil \\leq \\lfloor b_1 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\lfloor b_2 \\div 3 \\rfloor + \\ldots + \\lfloor b_n \\div 3 \\rfloor If n n is arbitrary these bounds don’t help us at all. But n n isn’t arbitrary, the keys used for PPPP encryption tend to be fairly short. Let’s say that we are dealing with keys of length 16 at most which is a safe bet. If we know the sum of the bytes these bounds allow us to narrow down k 3 k_3 to ⌈ 16 ⋅ 2 ÷ 3 ⌉ = 11 \\lceil 16 \\cdot 2 \\div 3 \\rceil = 11 possible values. But we don’t know the sum of bytes. What we have is k 1 k_1 which is that sum modulo 256, and the sum is actually i ⋅ 256 + k 1 i \\cdot 256 + k_1 where i i is some nonnegative integer. How large can i i get? Remembering that we are dealing with ASCII keys, each byte has at most the value 127. And we have at most 16 bytes. So the sum of bytes cannot be higher than 127 ⋅ 16 = 2032 127 \\cdot 16 = 2032 (or 7F0 in hexadecimal). Consequently, i i is 7 at most. Let’s write down the bounds for k 3 k_3 now: ⌈ ( i ⋅ 256 + k 1 − n ⋅ 2 ) ÷ 3 ⌉ ≤ j ⋅ 256 + k 3 ≤ ⌊ ( i ⋅ 256 + k 1 ) ÷ 3 ⌋ \\lceil (i \\cdot 256 + k_1 - n \\cdot 2) \\div 3 \\rceil \\leq j \\cdot 256 + k_3 \\leq \\lfloor (i \\cdot 256 + k_1) \\div 3 \\rfloor We have to consider this for eight possible values of i i . Wait, do we really? Once we move into modulo 256 space again, the i ⋅ 256 ÷ 3 i \\cdot 256 \\div 3 part of our bounds (which is the only part dependent on i i ) will assume the same value after every three i i values. So only three values of i i are really relevant, say 0, 1 and 2. Meaning that for each value of k 1 k_1 we have 3 ⋅ 11 = 33 3 \\cdot 11 = 33 possible values for k 3 k_3 . This gives us 256 ⋅ 33 ⋅ 64 = 540,672 256 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 64 = 540{,}672 as the number of possible effective keys. My experiments with random keys indicate that this should be pretty much as far down as it goes. There may still be more edge conditions rendering some effective keys impossible, but if these exist their impact is insignificant. Not all effective keys are equally likely however, the k 3 k_3 values at the outer edges of the possible range are very unlikely. So one could prioritize the keys by probability – if the total number weren’t already low enough to render this exercise moot. How many ciphertexts is that? We have the four byte plaintext F1 30 00 00 and we have 540,672 possible effective keys. How many ciphertexts does this translate to? With any reasonable encryption scheme the answer would be: slightly less than 540,672 due to a few unlikely collisions which could occur here. But PPPP doesn’t use a reasonable encryption scheme. With merely four bytes of plaintext there is a significant chance that PPPP will only use part of the effective key for encryption, resulting in identical ciphertexts for every key sharing that part. I didn’t bother analyzing this possibility mathematically, my script simply generated all possible ciphertexts. So the exact answer is: 540,672 effective keys produce 157,092 ciphertexts. And that’s why you should leave cryptography to experts. Understanding the response Now let’s say we send 157,092 encrypted requests. An encrypted response comes back. How do we decrypt it without knowing which of the requests was accepted? All PPPP packets start with the magic byte F1 , so the first byte of our response’s plaintext must be F1 as well. The “encryption” scheme used by PPPP allows translating that knowledge directly into the value of k 1 k_1 . Now one could probably (definitely) guess more plaintext parts and with some clever tricks deduce the rest of the effective key. But there are only 33 ⋅ 64 = 2,112 33 \\cdot 64 = 2{,}112 possible effective keys for each value of k 1 k_1 anyway. It’s much easier to simply try out all 2,112 possibilities and see which one results in a response that makes sense. The response here is 24 bytes large, making ambiguous decryptions less likely. Still, my experiments show that in approximately 4% of the cases closely related keys will produce valid but different decryption results. So you will get two or more similar device IDs and any one of them could be correct. I don’t think that this ambiguity can be resolved without further communication with the device, but at least with my changes the script reliably detects when a PPPP device is present on the network.",

It's a very ketamine-coded way to move through the world: https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/on-elon-musk-and-npcs Solipsism is a very difficult belief to maintain. No matter how sociopathic you are, there's always going to be a part of you that craves the approval, love and attention of others. That craving is a nagging reminder that other people do, in fact, exist. This creates the very weird insistence on the part of the ultra-rich that they are actually philanthropists. Thus, the very weird spectacle of corporate raiders – responsible for tens of thousands of job losses – describing themselves as \"job creators,\" and funding whole economic subdisciplines dedicated to shoring up this absurd claim (\"The search for a superior moral justification for selfishness\" -JK Galbraith): https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html Trying to squeeze this claim through an ever-narrowing credibility aperture forces it into some extremely weird shapes. Take \"Effective Altruism,\" the belief that you should make as much money as possible by working in the most exploitative and destructive fields you can find, in order to fund a program to improve the lives of 53 trillion hypothetical artificial people who will come into existence in 10,000 years: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future Effective Altruism, \"job creators\" (and other claims to billionaireism as a force for good in the world) show just how much work it takes to maintain the belief that other people don't exist. The ruling classes are haunted by this knowledge, and as more and more wealth accumulates in the hands of fewer and fewer people, those eminently guillotineable plutes need to perform increasingly complex mental gymnastics to keep from confronting the reality of other people. Corporate bosses have near-total control over the lives of their workers, who might number in the hundreds of thousands. But they also know, in their secret hearts, that they don't really control their businesses. If Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stops showing up for work, the company will continue to hum along, not missing a beat. But if all of Amazon's drivers or warehouse workers walk off the job, the company will grind to a halt. If they never come back, the company might never be able to restart, unable to recover the process knowledge that walks out the door with them: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/08/process-knowledge/#dance-monkey-dance Andy Jassy wants to think that he's in Amazon's driver's seat, but is haunted by the undeniable reality that Amazon is really in the hands of its lowest-paid, most abused workers. Andy Jassy isn't driving Amazon – he's stuck in the back seat, playing with a Fisher Price steering-wheel toy. Enter AI. AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete Your boss is an easy mark for these AI swindlers, because your boss dreams of a world without workers, because that's a world where bosses are driving the bus. The Hollywood writers' strike was precipitated by studio bosses' fantasy of a world without writers – a world where studio bosses don't have to be satisfied with giving harebrained notes to writers who don't bother to disguise their contempt for their bosses' shitty ideas. In a world of AI scripts, the boss decides what kind of movie to make, and a chatbot shits out a script to order, without ever telling the boss that the idea stinks. The fact that this is an unshootable turkey of a script is of secondary importance. The most important thing is the boss's all-consuming need to avoid ego-shattering conflicts with people who actually know how to do things, who gain power thanks to that knowledge, and who use that power to imply (or state outright) that you're a fucking dunce. Same goes for the Hollywood actors' strike, and the continued project of cloning actors in software and puppeteering them via chatbot: it's the fantasy of a movie without actors, actors who tell you that the scenario you've spun is an incoherent mess, who insist that their expertise in an art you don't understand and can't perform yourself entitles them to challenge your ideas. AI is solipsism, the fantasy of a world without people. Bosses keep pushing the idea that AI can replace doctors and (especially) nurses. Health bosses – increasingly likely to be a giant private equity fund – want to cut care in order to direct more money to the hospital's shareholders. They want to stop paying exterminators and allow their hospitals to fill up with thousands of bats: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house They want to stop paying for clean needles at dialysis clinics and transmit blood-borne chronic illnesses to immunocompromised, sick patients: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-dirty-business-of-clean-blood They want to use algorithmic death panels to eject sick patients from their beds before they can sit up, walk or, you know, survive: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/05/any-metric-becomes-a-target/#hca The problem is that nurses and doctors are professionals, and that means – by definition – that they follow a professional code of ethics that requires them to refuse their bosses' orders when those orders are bad for patients. The same goes for shrinks of all kinds – psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and counselors. They are legally and professionally required to put patients' mental health ahead of commercial imperatives. That's a big problem for any boss who wants to swap out in-person counseling for dial-a-doc shrink-on-demand services delivered via videoconference that serve up a new therapist every time the patient dials in, chasing the lowest wages around the country or the globe. The mania for \"AI therapists\" isn't driven by efficiency or by our societal mental health crisis – it's driven by the fantasy of mental health counseling without counselors (who insist on minimum standards for patient care): https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/01/doctor-robo-blabbermouth/#fool-me-once-etc-etc Capitalism is a single-criterion optimization: it organizes itself around the accumulation of capital, to the exclusion of all other criteria: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59821b9ff14aa110e16b69c0/t/686621934eb5b7060da1cdaf/1751523732570/Aaron+Benanav%2C+Beyond+Capitalism+1%2C+NLR+153%2C+May+June+2025.pdf This means that capitalism is forever locked in a conflict with professionalism, since professionalism is a system that upholds a code of conduct before all other priorities, including the capital accumulation. Professional ethics are, quite simply, bad for business. That's why bosses fantasize so furiously about pushing AI into professional situations – it's the fantasy of a profession without professionals. AI schoolteachers mean \"education without educators,\" which means that there's no organized group of trained and trusted professionals telling you that chatbot slop, high-stakes testing, and standardized curriculum will fail students. This is true no matter how much money you stand to make by replacing the skilled craft process of teaching with automation. Professions are infamously resistant to automation, unlike, say, manufacturing. This means that the cost of professional services steadily increases, relative to the cost of manufactured goods. The labor, energy, materials and time it took to travel from New York to Vienna have plummeted since the 18th century – but the number of hours it takes a Viennese string quartet to perform Mozart's String Quartet No 1 is the same today as it was in 1773 – about half an hour. The cost of producing a chalkboard has crashed over the past two centuries – but the number of hours it takes a math teacher to show a classroom full of ten year olds how to do long division has hardly budged. The cost of producing a scalpel is lower today than at any time in history, but the duration of an appendectomy has only decreased a little over the past century. Economists have a name for this: they call it \"cost disease.\" The fact that automation makes professional services (proportionally) more expensive over time isn't an indictment of professionalism, it's a testament to the power of automation for manufacturing. Bosses (should) know this, but they constantly bemoan the cost of professional services, as though the numerator (teaching, healthcare, screenwriting) is going up, when it's actually a shrinking denominator (automated manufacturing processes) that's increasing the price. The AI fantasy is a fantasy of dismantling the professions and replacing them with pliable chatbots who can be optimized for profits and thus cure cost disease for once and for all, and if that comes at the expense of the value that society derives from professional activities, that's a small price to pay for finally clearing the most stubborn barrier to capital accumulation. Last year, Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE fired or forced out a critical mass of government scientists, even as they gutted funding to research programs at the country's universities. You'd think that this would be a barrier to making scientific breakthroughs in America, but not according to Trump. He's promised that America will produce annual \"moonshot\"-scale breakthroughs, without scientists, by asking a chatbot to shit out paradigm-shattering scientific leaps on demand: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/ The problem is that while AIs can shit out sentences that seem to qualify as scientific breakthroughs, they can't actually do science. Take Google's claim that its Deepmind product had advanced material science by 800 years, \"discovering 2.2 million structures.\" It turns out that these \"discoveries\" are useless – in that they constitute trivial variations on known materials, and/or have no uses, and/or can only exist at absolute zero: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00643 But the fact that a chatbot can't do science isn't important to Trump – or at least, not as important as all the other things a chatbot won't do. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to stare at an eclipse. A chatbot won't tell Trump not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't tell Trump that trans people exist. A chatbot won't tell Trump that the climate emergency is real. A chatbot will agree with Trump when he says that offshore wind kills whales and that Tylenol causes autism. For Trump, the fantasy of science without scientists is more important than whether any science happens. America needs science, but for Trump – a billionaire solipsist – America is a country populated by people who mostly don't really exist. That's true of tech bosses, too. After all, they were the original suckers for Effective Altruism and the fantasy of a world without people. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg announced that the average person has three friends, but wants 15 friends, and that he would solve this with chatbots? https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mark-zuckerberg-on-ai-friendships_l_681a4bf3e4b0c2b15d96851d Sure, we all dunked on him for being such an unlikable fucking Martian that he doesn't understand what a \"friend\" is. But I don't think that's what's actually going on there: it's not that Zuck doesn't understand what friends are; it's that he treats your friendships as problems to be solved. Your friends' behavior determines how much money Zuck can make. When your friends arrange their interactions with you in a way that increases how much time you spend on his platforms, Zuckerberg maximizes the number of ads he gets to show you and thus how much money he can make. The fact that your friends stubbornly refuse to help him maximize his capital accumulation is a problem, and the solution to that problem is chatbots, which can be instructed to relate to you in ways that are optimized for increasing Zuck's wealth. For Zuck, chatbots are a fantasy of a social network without socializing. It's not just users that tech bosses fantasize about replacing with AI, though – they really want to get rid of coders. Computer programmers aren't (formally) a profession, but they are quite powerful, and have a cultural norm of criticizing their bosses' stupid ideas: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/ Tech bosses are completely dependent on coders, who know how to do things they don't know how to do, and aren't shy about letting them know it. That's why tech bosses are so quick to equate \"writing code\" with \"software engineering\" (the latter being a discipline that requires consideration of upstream, downstream and adjacent processes while prioritizing legibility and maintainability by future generations of engineers). A chatbot can produce software routines that perform some well-scoped task, but one thing they can't do is maintain the wide, deep \"context window\" at the heart of software engineering – a linear increase in a chatbot's context window results in a geometric increase in the amount of computation the chatbot has to perform: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/29/worker-frightening-machines/#robots-stole-your-jerb-kinda But the fact that chatbots will produce technical debt at scale is less important to tech bosses than the fact that a chatbot will do what you tell it without giving the boss any lip. For tech bosses, chatbots are the fantasy of a coding shop without any coders. This is a bad joke, literally. When I worked in a shop, we used to sarcastically say, \"Retail would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.\" We were unknowingly reprising Brecht, whose \"Die Lösung\" contains the immortal line, \"Would it not be simpler if the government simply dissolved the people and elected another?\" Billionaires don't see the humor. For them, AI is a chance to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the firm's drive-train, and make movies without writers or actors, factories without workers, hospitals without nurses, schools without teachers, science without scientists, code shops without coders, social media without socializing, and yes, even retail without the fucking customers. Billionaires love the idea of \"Universal Basic Income.\" For them, this is the apotheosis of the AI fantasy of a world without people. In this fantasy, the boss's toy steering wheel is steering the firm. Business consists of a boss and a computer that turns the boss's ideas into products. Who will consume these products? You will, thanks to UBI – the government will continue to exist in this fantasy, but for the sole purpose of creating new money and dispersing it to you, so that you can turn it over to billionaires who singlehandedly direct all of society's functions. Billionaires love UBI for the same reason they love charter schools. In the AI UBI fantasy, everyone who's not a billionaire has been replaced with a chatbot, and our only job is to receive government vouchers that we hand over to billionaire grifters who run the institutions that used to be under democratic control. We no longer vote with our ballots – only with our wallets, and in the wallet election, we only get the ballots that billionaires decide we deserve, and can only direct them between choices that are as meaningless as \"Mac vs Windows\" or \"Coke vs Pepsi.\" A world optimized for capital accumulation. It's a world without people.

    "title": "How the Organizational Risk Culture Standard can supercharge your cybersecurity culture",
    "summary": "You don’t lose most cyber battles to code. You lose them to culture: A rushed approval. A silent near-miss. A leader who shrugs at weak signals. Tools don’t fix that. People do, when they understand risk, own it and act with discipline under pressure. That is what the Organizational Risk Culture Standard (ORCS) gives you: A way to turn good intentions into daily behavior that defends trust. Cyber threats move fast. Your policies don’t. You work in VUCAD conditions: volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous and digitized. Static models lag. Judgment wins. Risk culture equips your team to interpret change, adjust in the moment and act with integrity when facts are partial and time is short. Why you need risk culture in cyber Most post-mortems trace back to the exact cause: human drift. Someone knew but stayed quiet. Another acted alone. The solution isn’t more rules; it’s a mindset that sees risk as everyone’s job. Risk culture aligns values, incentives and decisions, reinforced by transparent governance. In VUCAD conditions, it shifts behavior from blind compliance to fast, ethical judgment, replacing box-ticking with honesty, accountability and informed action when it matters most. Two payoffs stand out. First, faster detection through open reporting and psychological safety. Second, better choices under ambiguity because you balance taking risk with controlling it, which the standard calls dynamic risk equilibrium. The 10 dimensions, translated for cybersecurity The ORCS framework defines ten dimensions. Treat them as a system. Each one is distinct; together they are complete. Leadership & governance. Leaders set the tone, model the behavior and anchor accountability. If leaders treat cyber as only an IT issue, everyone else will, too. When leaders make risk-informed decisions visible, people copy them. Risk intelligence & adaptive elasticity. You read the environment and counter bias and stretch without breaking. In cyber, that means tuning playbooks to signals, not templates. You pivot while maintaining integrity and alignment. Ethics & values. Under real pressure, values decide. Clear principles stop corner-cutting, concealment and blame games when an incident bites. Intuitive and analytical decision-making. You blend instinct and evidence. Triaging alerts needs speed; approving data-sharing exceptions need rigor. Great teams shift gears without drama. Risk appetite, tolerance and acceptance. You draw the lines before the crisis. Which risks you pursue, which you cap and what you consciously accept. This removes guesswork and weak compromises at 2 a.m. Communication & transparency. People speak up early. Near-misses get surfaced and studied. Leaders share not only the what, but the why so the organization can act as one. Technology & process integration. Systems should amplify judgment, not replace it. Embed risk checks into workflows, dashboards and alerts so that doing the right thing is the easy path. People development & engagement. You teach cyber risk like a language. You build competence, confidence and ownership at every level. You reward proactive reporting and ethical decisions, not heroics. Alignment with frameworks. You map culture to standards such as ISO 31000, COSO ERM, NIST, FAIR and/or ISO 27001 and keep alignment alive as laws and expectations shift. It shows credibility and keeps practice grounded. Change management, sustainability & continuous learning. You treat culture as a product with releases, telemetry and upgrades. You monitor, adjust and reinforce until habits stick. Case study: The global manufacturer’s cultural stress test A global manufacturer spotted odd downtime in a supplier’s system and chose to treat it as a test of culture, not competence. The CEO’s message was simple: learn, don’t blame. Teams mixed data with gut instinct, warned the supplier early and acted within agreed risk limits. Regular updates built trust, while integrated tools helped people make sound calls fast. Afterward, both firms reviewed what worked, mapped fixes to ISO and NIST and shared lessons openly. The supplier later uncovered ransomware that had been contained before release, proof that a strong risk culture turns tension into trust and pressure into progress. These dimensions are not posters. They are levers you pull every week. The culture maturity path: From reactive to ‘presilient’ ORCS describes five maturity levels that map cleanly to cyber realities. Forget buzzwords. You need a ladder, not a slogan. Level 1 — Ad hoc: Heroics, silos and surprise. Level 2 — Developing: Pockets of progress; behavior uneven. Level 3 — Intermediate: Roles defined, leaders walking the talk. Level 4 — Advanced: Proactive learning, open reporting. Level 5 — High-performing: Presilience, adaptation without drama. A global manufacturer raised overall risk maturity by focusing on moving weaker sites from level 2 to level 3, rather than chasing perfection. Don’t jump levels. Build the muscles in sequence. Embed the framework into cyber operations Diagnose the baseline. Blend data with stories: use pulse surveys, focused interviews and artifact reviews. Spot silence on near-misses, track how fast risk travels and reveal where incentives clash with values. Define risk appetite and tolerance for cyber. Set clear limits on data loss, downtime and third-party risk. Give leaders short, usable statements. Define and document boundaries so teams act consistently. Design reinforcement systems. Bake cultural checks into governance. Add a “risk culture” section to risk committee packs. Require a short ethics note on material exceptions. Tie role descriptions and performance criteria to ownership, reporting and follow-through. People mirror what you measure. Develop people and align incentives. Train judgment, not just controls. Run red-team tabletop exercises that test psychological safety as much as response time. Recognize those who surface fragile truths early. Avoid perverse incentives that reward short-term wins at the cost of trust. Drive continuous feedback. Build a feedback architecture: data → reflection → dialogue → redesign. After incidents and near-misses, run brief learning reviews that focus on conditions, not culprits. Share the lessons widely. Retire rituals that don’t move behavior. Done well, risk culture stops being a memo and becomes muscle memory. One construction case from the standard shows how embedded roles, shared language and system alerts kept projects on track after a sudden supplier collapse. That is culture in motion, not wishful thinking. Measure what matters: KCIs for cyber risk culture If you can’t see culture, you can’t steer it. Build a short set of key cultural indicators (KCIs) that leaders will read and teams can influence. Speak-up rate. Percentage of staff who reported a suspected phishing email, control gap or near-miss this quarter. Rising is good; apathy is silent. Time to truth. Median time from detection to disclosure to the proper forum. Faster beats perfect. Ethical confidence index. Brief survey signal on “I feel safe raising risk concerns” and “My leaders act consistently with stated values.” Leadership risk messaging. Count of substantive communications from executives that explain cyber trade-offs, appetite and lessons learned. Exception hygiene. Share of exceptions with clear ethical rationale, expiry and owner. Layer these with the maturity scales in each dimension. Track progression by dimension, not just in the aggregate. Publish the trend. Use it in your board story, alongside familiar KRIs and technical metrics, so culture and control sit side by side. That’s how you turn measurement into momentum. A financial company published these alongside its patching stats. At first, investors raised eyebrows. Six months later, regulators called it exemplary transparency. Make it stick: From projects to habits Culture fails when it lives in launch decks. It sticks when people feel two things: clarity and consequence. Clarity comes from leaders who model the behavior and name the trade-offs out loud. Consequence comes from systems that reward what you want and make the wrong path hard. Culture changes when lessons become reflexes: small, repeated actions that outlast the project plan. The companies that sustain high performance do one thing differently: they balance three cultural mindsets instead of leaning on just one. Compliance gives structure and discipline to meet standards and follow the rules. It keeps the floor steady. Resilience accepts that things will go wrong and prepares people to recover fast, protecting trust when pressure hits. Presilience goes a step further. It builds foresight into the system, turning prevention and innovation into daily practice. True strength lies between compliance, resilience and presilience, where rules guide, recovery is natural and foresight continually drives progress. Make it stick by rewarding these everyday choices: the engineer who flags a weak control before it fails, the manager who turns a near-miss into a learning story, the board that asks, “What’s our next opportunity hidden inside this risk?” That’s how culture shifts from program to pattern and performance becomes sustainable. Adopt a simple rhythm: Quarterly: Refresh your culture dash; review signals and stories. Monthly: Spotlight a lesson learned; show the change it drove. Weekly: Ask one risk culture question in every leadership stand-up. Daily: Embed tiny friction, checklists, prompts and default settings that nudge the right action at the right moment. Tie it all to presilience, the capacity to anticipate, adapt and advance. You earn trust when you act fast and fair under stress. That trust outlasts the incident. It compounds. Common traps and how to avoid them Policy theater. Lots of documents, little behavior. Fix by testing policies through live simulations and learning reviews. Retire the brittle ones. Fear-based messaging. Fear spikes activity, then breeds avoidance. Replace it with clear appetite, ethical anchors and practical guidance. Metric overload. Fifteen dashboards, no decisions. Choose a small set of KCIs and KRIs that leaders can explain without notes. Tech worship. Tools matter, but judgment rules. Train bias awareness. Pair automation with human checks where the stakes are high. One-and-done change. Culture erodes without reinforcement. Use the maturity model to plan the next level and resource it. Your first 90 days Days 1–30. Run a crisp baseline: short survey, six interviews, artifact scan. Identify three behavior chokepoints where risk signals die. Publish one page on findings. Days 31–60. Set cyber risk appetite and tolerance in plain language. Add culture questions to risk committee packs. Pilot two micro-nudges in priority workflows. Days 61–90. Launch a leader-led learning ritual after incidents and near-misses. Add KCIs to the monthly cyber dashboard. Recognize two teams for raising challenging issues early. A manufacturing group did precisely this. By day 90, the average incident disclosure time dropped from 9 days to 2. Nothing fancy; just culture, clarified. Keep it public. Keep it human. Keep it moving. The payoff you can take to the board When you embed the Organizational Risk Culture Standard, you gain three edges: Speed. Signals move quickly; recovery accelerates. Quality. Bias checks sharpen judgment; appetite lines prevent overreach. Trust. People speak up; leaders act consistently; customers believe you. A financial company saw this firsthand: internal detection doubled, external findings halved and regulator confidence soared. They didn’t just pass audits; they built credibility. These gains compound. You stop paying the ignorance tax: silence, delay, reputational drag and start earning the compound interest of trust. Your move You win cyber by building a culture where people make sound choices when the facts are fuzzy and the clock is cruel. ORCS gives you the scaffolding: leadership that models, systems that reinforce and measures that matter. Use it to align appetite, accelerate learning and turn near-misses into better habits. That’s how you supercharge cybersecurity culture, protect trust when it counts and build a team that doesn’t just survive the storm; it reads the sky, sets the sails and makes speed.

    "title": "Cybersecurity firm turns tables on threat actors with decoy data trap",
    "summary": "Cybersecurity firm Resecurity says it deliberately lured threat actors linked to Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters ( SLH ) alliance into a honeypot, after the group claimed that it had hacked the company and stolen internal and client data. “Understanding that the actor is conducting reconnaissance, our team has set up a honey pot account,” Resecurity said in a blog post, indicating prior knowledge of threat actor probing. “This led to a successful login by the threat actor to one of the emulated applications containing synthetic data.” The threat actors claiming to be SLH’s “ ShinyHunters ” initially posted screenshots and claimed that they had breached Resecurity’s systems, but soon after the firm said it was a honeypot, the actual group confirmed they had no connection to the attack. “We would like to announce that we have gained full access to Resecurity systems,” the threat actors reportedly said in a Telegram post. “For months, REsecurity has been trying to social engineer us and groups we know. When ShinyHunters put the Vietnam financial system database up for sale, their staff pretended to be buyers to get free samples and more info from us.” As proof, the threat actors had attached screenshots of Resecurity employees’ internal communication in a Mattermost collaboration instance. What Resecurity says really happened According to Resecurity, its security teams observed reconnaissance activity targeting externally exposed services before the attackers made their claims public. In response, the company said it steered the activity toward a honeypot environment populated with synthetic data designed to resemble internal systems. The honeypot included fabricated consumer records and simulated payment data structured to appear realistic while remaining fully isolated from Resecurity’s production environment. The company said this allowed the attackers to believe they had gained meaningful access, while enabling defenders to monitor activity without exposing real data. “For synthetic data, we used two different datasets: over 28,000 records impersonating consumers and over 190,000 records of payment transactions, and generated messages,” Resecurity said in the post. “Notably, in both cases, we utilized already known breached data available on the Dark Web and underground marketplaces—potentially containing PII—making the data even more realistic for threat actors.” Resecurity added that the attackers interacted with the decoy environment over an extended period, generating automated requests that provided insight into their tooling and methods. Evidence of real breach remains thin Despite Resecurity’s detailed account, the threat actors have not backed up their original claims with additional verifiable evidence. After posting the screenshots, no substantiated leaks of internal systems or actual client data have appeared. Independent analysis by various cybersecurity researchers supports Resecurity’s assertion that no production assets were compromised. On the other hand, Resecurity’s own analysis of the interaction patterns aligned with common threat actors’ tactics. According to the company’s investigation, the activity began with reconnaissance of publicly exposed systems, which matched MITRE ATT&CK techniques such as Active Scanning (T1595) and Gather Victim Host Information (T1592), based on network telemetry and log data. Following the publication of the claims, a spokesperson claiming to represent ShinyHunters denied the group’s involvement, saying it was not responsible for the activity Resecurity attributed to the alleged attackers.",

    "title": "WhatsApp Silent Fix of Device Fingerprinting Privacy Issue Assessment: The Good, The (Not So) Bad…",
    "summary": "WhatsApp Silent Fix of Device Fingerprinting Privacy Issue Assessment: The Good, The (Not So) Bad, and The (Somewhat) Ugly TL;DR: Using our research tool, we discovered that WhatsApp is silently implementing fixes for device fingerprinting privacy vulnerabilities. While the fix remains incomplete, it signals WhatsApp is finally starting to address vulnerabilities that were responsibly disclosed by the security community. WhatsApp fix: The Good, The (Not So) Bad, and The (Somewhat) Ugly Meta’s WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app with over 3 billion monthly active users , serves as a primary attack channel for cyber attackers seeking to infect victims with malware. While WhatsApp’s End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) protocol protects message confidentiality, its design and implementation flaws expose users’ device details. This information provides attackers who use WhatsApp as an attack vector with crucial reconnaissance data about potential victims. Recently, WhatsApp started to silently remediate some of these issues. In this blog post, we will analyze and assess this fix. The Original Issues Why fingerprinting matters When advanced attackers set out to infect their victim’s mobile device with malware, WhatsApp is their main vehicle due to its ubiquity. Reconnaissance: The cyber kill-chain’s first step The first step in a cyber campaign is reconnaissance. Attackers must know their victim’s device operating system to successfully infect it. Sending an Android exploit to an iPhone (or vice versa) is not only ineffective — it can alert victims they’re under attack. Such discovery may trigger a domino effect, jeopardizing attackers’ million-dollar 0-day 0-click vulnerabilities, full infrastructure, and target list. Virtue or Vice? A First Look at Paragon's Proliferating Spyware Operations - The Citizen Lab This was the recent case in which Citizen Lab and WhatsApp leveraged a detected exploit to expose the operations of the Paragon spyware group. Multiple WhatsApp privacy leaks In early 2024, we published our research on WhatsApp privacy issues and showed how WhatsApp leaks the identity and cardinality of user devices: Hi Meta, WhatsApp with privacy? The core issue is that under WhatsApp’s E2EE multi-device protocol, each of the receiving user’s devices maintains a separate session with the sender’s device, with different encryption keys, thus making the devices identifiable. Later that year, we showed how attackers can abuse these individual per-device sessions to pinpoint their attacks to a specific device of their choice. Hi Meta, WhatsApp with Integrity? In 2025, Gegenhuber et al showed that not only can attackers learn the identity of the devices from the encryption keys, they can also fingerprint the device — that is, find its exact operating system (OS). With this chain of vulnerabilities, attackers can now: Find out which mobile device their victim is using: Android or iPhone Deliver the relevant exploit to this specific device and not to other user devices All of these issues were responsibly disclosed to WhatsApp but were not addressed. Deep dive into WhatsApp device fingerprinting As part of its normal operation, senders need to query WhatsApp servers for the encryption material required to set up a session with each of the receiver’s devices. Since the encryption material must be created on each individual device and not on the server to maintain the E2EE property, implementation differences can leak the device’s specific operating system. Gegenhuber et al showed that indeed some key IDs suffer from such implementation differences and can therefore be used to determine the victim’s device OS. WhatsApp different device logic can be used for fingerprinting Notably, since no actual interaction is made with the user’s devices, they have no way of knowing their information was queried. We have independently verified Gegenhuber’s findings with a tool we created (but have not yet made public). Device fingerprinting demonstrated with our WhatsApp research tool The Fix A few days ago, using our tool, we noticed that Android logic for selecting Signed PK ID had changed. WhatsApp‘s new Android logic Instead of starting with 0 and slowly incrementing (once a month), it is now assigned at random. The Good WhatsApp has finally started to address this important issue! This is a very welcomed change from Meta’s original position that would not consider such a fingerprinting problem as a relevant privacy issue that mandates fixing. The (Not So) Bad Attackers can still distinguish with high certainty between Android and iPhone based on One-Time PK ID. Since iPhone initializes this parameter with a low value and slowly increments it (every few days), it is still highly distinguishable from Android’s random value, which makes use of its entire 24-bit range. We have updated our tool to successfully accommodate this change. However, it seems reasonable to believe that this is WhatsApp’s first step toward a more complete fix that will make these fields random on all operating systems and platforms. If indeed this is the plan, it will obliterate this fingerprinting privacy vulnerability. The (Somewhat) Ugly It appears that WhatsApp implemented this fix silently, without notifying the original reporters of these issues, awarding the appropriate bounties, or assigning these vulnerabilities a Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) number. On a different but similar device fingerprinting issue we disclosed to WhatsApp, WhatsApp implemented a fix and awarded a small bounty, but would not assign a CVE due to not “not meet[ing] our severity threshold” WhatsApp Device Fingerprinting issue: Bug Bounty awarded but not a CVE We think a CVE should not be treated as a ‘mark of shame,’ but rather as a tool to properly document and discuss security and privacy issues. We agree that not all CVEs have the same severity, which should be reflected in appropriately low CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores and not by omitting the CVE in the first place. Summing Up WhatsApp device fingerprinting issue in a nutshell Meta’s WhatsApp is improving its security and privacy against fingerprinting vulnerabilities. The research work conducted by the security community was not in vain. However, we believe that WhatsApp could be more transparent and collaborative, working more openly with the security community for the greater good of its users.",

Our org basically started at 0 on security maturity, so instead of jumping straight into ISO we began with the CIS Controls v8 framework because it felt more practical and easier to get momentum. It helped us structure things fast: basic hygiene, asset inventory, access control, logging, awareness, etc. Now we’re switching gears toward ISO 27001 certification, and I’m hoping the work we did with CIS means we’re actually closer than it feels even if we didn’t build everything “ISO-first”. What we’re doing right now. Writing extra documentation per CIS safeguard, like procedures + policies (so it’s not just “we do it”, but also “here’s how and who owns it”) Questions for people who’ve done ISO 27001: If you started with CIS, did it translate well into ISO 27001? Or did you hit big gaps? What are the common pitfalls in that first baseline interview? What documents/processes were the auditor most focused on early (risk assessment? SoA? governance? evidence?)

    "title": "OPNsense Firewall as Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in Azure",
    "summary": "This blog is available as a video on YouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=JtnIFiB7jkE Introduction to OPNsense In today’s cloud-driven world, securing your infrastructure is more critical than ever. One powerful solution is OPNsense. OPNsense is a powerful open-source firewall that can be used to secure your virtual networks. Originally forked from pfSense , which itself evolved from m0n0wall . OPNsense could run on Windows, MacOS, Linux including OpenBSD and FreeBSD. It provides a user-friendly web interface for configuration and management. What makes OPNsense Firewall stand out is its rich feature set: VPN Support for point-to-site and site-to-site connections using technologies like WireGuard and OpenVPN. DNS Management with options such as OpenDNS and Unbound DNS. Multi-network handling enabling you to manage different LANs seamlessly. Advanced security features including intrusion detection and forward proxy integration. Plugin ecosystem supporting official and community extensions for third-party integrations. In this guide, you’ll learn how to install and configure OPNsense Firewall on an Azure Virtual Machine, leveraging its capabilities to secure your cloud resources effectively. We'll have three demonstrations: Installing OPNsense on an Azure virtual machine Setting up point-to-site VPN using WireGuard Here is the architecture we want to achieve in this blog, except the Hb and Spoke configuration which is planned for the second part coming soon. 1. Installing OPNsense on an Azure Virtual Machine There are three ways to have OPNsense in a virtual machine. Create a VM from scratch and install OPNsense. Install using the pre-packaged ISO image created by Deciso the company that maintains OPNsense. Use a pre-built VM image from the Azure Marketplace . In this demo, we will use the first approach to have more control over the installation and configuration. We will create an Azure VM with FreeBSD OS and then install OPNsense using a shell script through the Custom Script Extension . All the required files are in this repository: github.com/HoussemDellai/azure-network-course/205_nva_opnsense . The shell script configureopnsense.sh will install OPNsense and apply a predefined configuration file config.xml to set up the firewall rules, VPN, and DNS settings. It will take 4 parameters: GitHub path where the script and config file are hosted, in our case it is /scripts/ . OPNsense version to install, currently set to 25.7 . Gateway IP address for the trusted subnet. Public IP address of the untrusted subnet. This shell script is executed after the VM creation using the Custom Script Extension in Terraform represented in the file vm_extension_install_opnsense.tf . OPNsense is intended to be used an NVA so it would be good to apply some of the good practices. One of these practices is to have two network interfaces: Trusted Interface : Connected to the internal network (spokes). Untrusted Interface : Connected to the internet (WAN). This setup allows OPNsense to effectively manage and secure traffic between the internal network and the internet. Second good practice is to start with a predefined configuration file config.xml that includes the basic settings for the firewall, VPN, and DNS. This approach saves time and ensures consistency across deployments. It is recommended to start with closed firewall rules and then open them as needed based on your security requirements. But for demo purposes, we will allow all traffic. Third good practice is to use multiple instances of OPNsense in a high-availability setup to ensure redundancy and failover capabilities. However, for simplicity, we will use a single instance in this demo. Let's take a look at the resources that will be created by Terraform using the AzureRM provider : Resource Group Virtual Network (VNET) named vnet-hub with two subnets: Trusted Subnet : Internal traffic between spokes. Untrusted Subnet : Exposes the firewall to the internet. Network Security Group (NSG) : attached to the untrusted subnet, with rules allowing traffic to the VPN, OPNsense website and to the internet. Virtual Machine : with the following configuration: FreeBSD OS image using version 14.1. VM size: Standard_D4ads_v6 with NVMe disk for better performance. Admin credentials: feel free to change the username and password with more security. Two NICs (trusted and untrusted) with IP forwarding enabled to allow traffic to pass through the firewall. NAT Gateway : attached to the untrusted subnet for outbound internet connectivity. Apply Terraform configuration To deploy the resources, run the following commands in your terminal from within the 205_nva_opnsense directory: terraform init terraform apply -auto-approve Terraform provisions the infrastructure and outputs resource details. In the Azure portal you should see the newly created resources. Accessing the OPNsense dashboard To access the OPNsense dashboard: Get the VM’s public IP from the Azure portal or from Terraform output. Paste it into your browser. Accept the TLS warning (TLS is not configured yet). Log in with Username: root and Password: opnsense you can change it later in the dashboard. You now have access to the OPNsense dashboard where you can: Monitor traffic and reports. Configure firewall rules for LAN, WAN, and VPN. Set up VPNs (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IPsec). Configure DNS services (OpenDNS, UnboundDNS). Now that the OPNsense firewall is up and running, let's move to the next steps to explore some of its features like VPN. 2. Setting up Point-to-Site VPN using WireGuard We’ll demonstrate how to establish a WireGuard VPN connection to OPNsense firewall. The configuration file config.xml used during installation already includes the necessary settings for WireGuard VPN. For more details on how to set up WireGuard on OPNsense, refer to the official documentation . We will generate a Wireguard peer configuration using the OPNsense dashboard. Navigate to VPN > WireGuard > Peer generator then add a name for the peer, fill in the IP address for the OPNsense which is the public IP of the VM in Azure, use the same IP if you want to use the pre-configured UnboundDNS. Then copy the generated configuration and click on Store and generate next and Apply. Next we'll use that configuration to set up WireGuard on a Windows client. Here you can either use your current machine as a client or create a new Windows VM in Azure. We'll go with this second option for better isolation. We'll deploy the client VM using Terraform file vpn_client_vm_win11.tf . Make sur it is deployed using command terraform apply -auto-approve. Once the VM is ready, connect to it using RDP, download and install WireGuard . Alternatively, you can install WireGuard using the following Winget command: winget install -e --id WireGuard.WireGuard --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements Launch WireGuard application, click on Add Tunnel > Add empty tunnel... , then paste the peer configuration generated from OPNsense and save it. Then click on Activate to start the VPN connection. We should see the data transfer starting. We'll verify the VPN connection by pinging the VM, checking the outbound traffic passes through the Nat Gateway's IPs and also checking the DNS resolution using UnboundDNS configured in OPNsense. ping 10.0.1.4 # this is the trusted IP of OPNsense in Azure # Pinging 10.0.1.4 with 32 bytes of data: # Reply from 10.0.1.4: bytes=32 time=48ms TTL=64 # ... curl ifconfig.me/ip # should display the public IP of the Nat Gateway in Azure # 74.241.132.239 nslookup microsoft.com # should resolve using UnboundDNS configured in OPNsense # Server: UnKnown # Address: 135.225.126.162 # Non-authoritative answer: # Name: microsoft.com # Addresses: 2603:1030:b:3::152 # 13.107.246.53 # 13.107.213.53 # ... The service endpoint ifconfig.me is used to get the public IP address of the client. You can use any other similar service. What's next ? Now that you have OPNsense firewall set up as an NVA in Azure and have successfully established a WireGuard VPN connection, we can explore additional features and configurations such as integrating OPNsense into a Hub and Spoke network topology. That will be covered in the next part of this blog.

    "title": "Cybersecurity leaders’ resolutions for 2026",
    "summary": "As the AI-hype dust settles, CISOs have a lot to focus on 2026. From ongoing struggles such as ensuring teams are not burning out to current and future concerns, which includes finding effective business cases for AI, focusing on spotting a breach before it happens to planning for looming fear of breaking quantum encryption, CISOs from different industries share what is top of their agenda for 2026. 1. Prioritize resilience over reactive security Emphasis on resilience and architectural discipline, particularly as organizations face even greater reliance on cloud infrastructure, is part of Fortitude Re CISO Elliott Franklin ’s resolutions. “Our approach will focus on well-structured project management and intentional design,” he says. Any new initiative will start with a clear architectural plan and a deep understanding of end-to-end dependencies and potential points of failure. “By taking a thoughtful, engineering-driven approach — rather than reacting to outages or disruptions — we aim to strengthen the stability, scalability, and reliability of our systems,” he says. “This foundation enables the business to move with confidence, knowing our technology and security investments are built to endure and evolve.” 2. AI will dominate the agenda Standard Chartered group CISO Cezary Piekarski expects his agenda to be dominated by AI in two ways: defining both the threat landscape and defensive architecture. “Speed is essential when mitigating attacks so leveraging AI and orchestration tools allows us to quickly automate detection and streamline incident response,” Piekarski says. “This reduces dwell time significantly and accelerates remediation, ensuring that threats are contained before they escalate.” As new attack surfaces emerge with AI-driven applications and systems, Piekarski’s priorities will focus on defending and hardening the environment against AI-enabled threats and tactics. “It’s harnessing the opportunities of AI across the cyber stack and enabling the bank to use AI securely and safely.” Qiagen CISO Daniel Schatz expects artificial intelligence to remain a core theme across 2026 “in terms of using AI to improve security controls and operations, and ensuring AI is securely integrated into products.” He expects a notable escalation in the sophistication and scale of generative AI enabled threats. “What we have observed so far are largely handcrafted AI-supported campaigns, but they will likely evolve into more automated and industrialized social-engineering operations, following the same pattern seen with most emerging threats,” Schatz says. “With generative AI becoming ubiquitous, technologies that help organizations understand, manage, and secure the AI attack surface will quickly rise in importance. It’s critical that the industry embeds appropriate security controls from the start, so we avoid repeating the mistakes seen during the early days of web development.” 3. Achieve visibility and control, especially with AI The priority for Conal Gallagher, Flexera’s CIO and CISO, is balancing productivity with protecting intellectual property as Flexera teams use AI tools and chatbots. “We’re working to standardize trusted, enterprise-grade AI solutions, while putting controls in place to prevent data leakage from unsanctioned tools.” In practice, SaaS management and discovery tools will be used to get a handle on shadow IT and unsanctioned AI usage. Automation for compliance and reporting will be important as customer and regulatory requirements around ESG and security continue to grow, along with threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability management solutions that help Gallagher and the team stay ahead of what’s happening in the wild. “The common thread is visibility and control; we need to know what’s in our environment, how it’s being used, and that we can respond quickly when things change,” he tells CSO. 4. Manage human and non-human identities Schatz is focused on managing human and non-human identities . He expects technologies that enable effective identity management will continue to be critical. “Human identities remain challenging to protect, and non-human identities are only beginning to grow in scale with the emergence of agentic AI,” he says. With a similar plan, Franklin is prioritizing identity and privilege management — across both human and non-human identities. “It’s [about] ensuring that service accounts, APIs, and automation tools are governed with the same rigor as user accounts,” Franklin says. “As automation grows, effectively managing these digital identities will be critical to maintaining trust, traceability, and control in complex environments.” The goal is to strengthen the organization’s overall resilience while enabling productivity and collaboration. 5. Build security into agentic AI products Some are prioritizing building security directly into agentic AI products to mitigate sophisticated attacks. “We’re moving beyond simply trying to stop AI risks to engineering security directly into our agentic solutions, ensuring the secure path to innovation is the fastest path for our teams,” Qualtrics CSO Assaf Keren says. Keren will be utilizing AI to strengthen security capabilities, automate and accelerate internal functions like SOC triage and control testing. 6. Link security with trust For Keren, 2026 is also about making security a visible trust signal, not just a back-office function. He’s looking to transform security into a proactive, transparent partnership with their customers. “Customers are making purchasing decisions based on how organizations handle data and AI. Treating security as a go-to-market advantage, not just risk mitigation,” he tells CSO. This means getting certified with FedRAMP High, ISO 42001 for AI, being transparent about security practices, and making security posture a visible part of the value proposition. “Organizations that can credibly demonstrate robust security and responsible AI practices will win customers who are increasingly making decisions based on trust.” 7. Develop a quantum readiness plan “Quantum computing poses significant cyber risks by potentially breaking current encryption methods, impacting data security, and enabling new attack vectors,” says Piekarski. With this in mind, Piekarski and the team are actively preparing for what lies ahead and that means quantum threats. “In 2026, we’ll continue progress on our multi-year, resilient cryptography preparedness strategy to meet the challenges of the emerging threat and address associated risks,” he says. Jon France, CISO, ISC2, urges CISOs to prepare for post-quantum cryptography. This involves reviewing their own organization and systems and then turning to their vendors and partners about their readiness. “The roadmap includes a cryptographic inventory and then asking [vendors] ‘what are you doing on quantum and what’s your roadmap?’ There will be some things you’ll have to sunset, probably earlier than you thought, so you have to plan around that,” he says. 8. Protect people, not just systems In 2026 and beyond, security strategies will need to consider workforce resilience, not only tools, controls, and compliance as stress and skills transformation permanently reshape the cyber workforce. With burnout an ever-present problem, AI changing skills and jobs, and economic conditions putting pressure on budgets, CISOs must look after the wellbeing of their teams as much as the technology. “Looking after the team while leveraging the team but without killing them is on our agenda,” says France. 9. Spot breaches early As cloud systems expand and supply chains stretch further, the old idea of total prevention is fading fast. CISOs will be under increasing pressure to prioritize detection and response in their security program. “The strongest security programs won’t be the ones that stop every breach, they’ll be the ones that spot them first,” says Jan Bee , TeamViewer’s CISO. Bee believes that instead of building a fortress around the organization, CISOs will need to favor visibility and speed. “In the age of agentic AI and hyperconnected SaaS, that speed will be everything,” says Bee. “The organizations that can see trouble coming in seconds will stay ahead of even the most heavily defended but slow-to-react peers.” 10. Get ahead of the threat curve “Organizations tend to move at a somewhat slower pace, so looking ahead at the developing threat landscape and pre-positioning appropriately is essential as we close the year’s budgeting cycle,” says Schatz. On his agenda is reviewing established sources such as the WEF Cybersecurity Outlook, the ENISA Threat Landscape and the ISF Threat Horizon. “It helps to set expectations and allows for more realistic planning of risk controls over the next 12-36 months,” he tells CSO. 11. Close the communications gap CISOs, boards and IT leaders must align around a shared language of resilience — which treats security as a business priority not simply a technical measure. Many boards still view security as a compliance or cost issue, while CISOs talk in terms of risk and continuity, according to Bee. “That communication gap creates blind spots that attackers can exploit,” he says. “As cyber risk becomes inseparable from business risk, boards and CISOs will be forced to collaborate more closely, translating technical threats into financial, reputational, and operational impacts that executives can act on.” CISOs should focus on storytelling, not just reporting. “This means connecting threat intelligence to business outcomes in clear, strategic terms.” Boards, in turn, need to treat cyber resilience as a competitive advantage, not a line item. “The companies that close the cultural gap between security and strategy will be the ones that recover faster, and inspire greater investor confidence when incidents inevitably occur,” Bee says. 12. Deliver outcomes, not vibes “In 2026, execution will matter more than experimentation,” says Gallagher. In practice, he will be adopting a disciplined approach that emphasizes transparency, governance, and measurable outcomes across the security program. “Every initiative will be measured by its ability to tie spend to ROI and tangible risk reduction,” he tells CSO. AI initiatives, in particular, are likely to come under real scrutiny to show outcomes and effective business use cases as the excitement and buzz of 2025 settles. “It feels like 2026 is about making AI a business engine, not a science project,” he says.",

    "title": "Was ist Federated Identity Management?",
    "summary": "Federated Identity optimiert Komfort und Sicherheit auf Kosten der Komplexität. PeachShutterStock | shutterstock.com Im Kern der Enterprise Security steht die Zerreißprobe zwischen Benutzerkomfort und Security-Anforderungen. Dabei handelt es sich um einen Balanceakt, der regelmäßig auf Authentifizierungsebene ausgetragen wird und sich direkt auf das Onboarding- und Anmeldeerlebnis auswirkt. Geht es darum diesen Konflikt aufzulösen, steht Federated Identity an vorderster Front: Sie kann eine gute User Experience bieten, ohne dabei das Sicherheitsniveau zu beeinträchtigen. Federated Identity Management – Definition Identity & Access Management ( IAM ) ist der übergeordnete Bereich, in dem es um digitale Identitäten und Zugriffsmanagement geht. Federated Identity Management (oder förderiertes Identitätsmanagement) ist eine IAM-Kategorie, die darauf fokussiert, ein einziges Authentifizierungsereignis sicher zu ermöglichen, um mehrere Interaktionen oder den Austausch von Identitätsinformationen abzudecken. Mit anderen Worten: Federated Identity Management (FIM) ermöglicht vielen Diensten, eine einzige digitale Identität gemeinsam zu nutzen. Ein Beispiel für den praktischen Einsatz von FIM wäre, wenn Sie sich bei Twitter mit ihrem Google-Konto anmelden. Föderiertes Identitätsmanagement kann der Benutzererfahrung, der allgemeinen Sicherheit und der Ausfallsicherheit zuträglich sein. Dafür gilt es, folgende Kompromisse einzugehen: erhöhte architektonische Komplexität, Bindung an einen bestimmten Anbieter und mögliche Servicekosten. Federated Identity Management wird bisweilen mit Single Sign-On (SSO) in einen Topf geworfen. Genau genommen ist SSO allerdings eine Funktion von FIM – und einer seiner wesentlichen Use Cases, den wir im Folgenden näher betrachten. Zuvor noch ein Hinweis: Das Thema Self-Sovereign Identity (oder dezentrale Identität ) ist wieder eine andere Baustelle . Anwendungsfall (Federated) Single-Sign On Man unterscheidet zwei Arten von Single Sign-on: Einerseits das, was für Anwendungen innerhalb einer einzelnen Organisation gilt, und andererseits das, was organisationsübergreifend gilt. Ersteres wird in der Regel einfach als Single Sign-on bezeichnet, manchmal auch als “Enterprise Single Sign-on”. Letzteres fällt unter den Begriff Federated Single Sign-on (FSSO). Die High-Level-Architektur, um beide SSO-Formen abzudecken, sieht folgendermaßen aus: Der Blick auf eine High-Level-SSO-Architektur. Foto: Foundry / Matthew Tyson In jedem Fall erfordert Federated Identity Management eine zentrale Institution, die die gemeinsamen Anmeldeinformationen zwischen den verschiedenen Diensten vermittelt. Dabei kann es sich um einen Identity Manager handeln, der: von der Organisation selbst erstellt wurde (etwa unter Verwendung von Active Directory ). über einen Identitätsanbieter in unterschiedlichem Umfang bereitgestellt wird. Enterprise Single Sign-on deckt oft Situationen ab, in denen sich Mitarbeiter mehrfach bei internen Systemen anmelden müssen, beispielsweise an HR-Portal und IT-Ticketsystem. Dieses Konzept birgt offensichtliche UX-, aber auch systemische Probleme, weil Identitätsinformationen über heterogene Systeme verteilt werden. Dieser Umstand beeinträchtigt die Sicherheit und erschwert es, Richtlinien durchzusetzen. So müssen etwa bei On- und Off-Boarding eines Mitarbeiters gleich zwei verschiedene Datenspeicher geändert werden. Federated Single Sign-on ermöglicht die gemeinsame Nutzung von Anmeldeinformationen über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg. Als solches stützt es sich in der Regel auf eine große, gut etablierte Einheit mit weitreichendem Trust – beispielsweise Google, Microsoft oder Amazon. Selbst eine kleine Applikation kann relativ einfach um die Option “Anmelden bei Google” ergänzt werden und den Nutzern eine einfache Anmeldemöglichkeit bieten, bei der sensible Informationen in den Händen der großen Organisation bleiben. Federated SSO implementieren Der Aufbau einer Federated SSO-Lösung richtet sich nach den jeweils spezifischen Anforderungen. Die allgemeinen Schritte sind dabei jedoch identisch: Identity Provider einrichten: Entweder, Sie stellen eine zentralisierte Identity Infrastructure bereit oder Sie richten ein Konto bei einem Federated-Identity-Anbieter ein (Google, Microsoft, Okta). Auch eine Möglichkeit: Sie kreieren eine Mischform. Provider mit Anwendungsinformationen füttern: So konfigurieren Sie den Identity Provider und schaffen die Grundlage, dass sich Applikationen mit dem Anbieter verbinden können. Provider-Anmeldeinformationen hinzufügen: Diese werden Sie im nächsten Schritt verwenden, um Ihren Anwendungen mitzuteilen, wie sie sich authentifizieren sollen. Applikationen einrichten: In Ihrem Anwendungscode fügen Sie Abhängigkeiten für die Authentifizierung und Interaktion mit dem Identity-Provider-Service hinzu. Neue Authentifizierung integrieren: Mit dem konfigurierten SSO-Service haben Ihre Benutzer eine Möglichkeit, sich zu authentifizieren. Das funktioniert auch in “transparent”: Anwendungen erkennen und authentifizieren User mit einer Live-Session bei einem anderen Service automatisch. Weil es eine einfache Lösung ist, entscheiden sich die meisten Unternehmen heute für einen Cloud Identity Provider im Rahmen eines SaaS-Angebots – sowohl, wenn es um Enterprise als auch wenn es um Federated SSO geht. SSO-Protokolle implementieren Für SSO-Interaktionen werden im Wesentlichen drei Protokolle verwendet: SAML , OIDC und OAuth 2.0 . Je nachdem, welches Protokoll der von Ihnen verwendete Identity-Anbieter unterstützt, werden Sie eines davon verwenden, um die sicheren Token-Informationen zwischen Ihren Anwendungen zu übermitteln. Jedes der Protokolle stellt einen offenen Standard dar, der auf einen bestimmten Anwendungsfall ausgerichtet ist. SAML ist ein XML-basiertes Protokoll, das häufig in Unternehmen verwendet wird, um Enterprise SSO zu unterstützen oder um zwischen verschiedenen Business-Service-Anbietern hin- und herzuspringen. Es kann auch für die allgemeine gemeinsame Nutzung von Identitäten verwendet werden, einschließlich Federated SSO (insofern der Identity Provider das unterstützt). OAuth 2.0 ist ein Authentifizierungsprotokoll, das die gemeinsame Nutzung von Ressourcendaten zwischen Anbietern auf der Grundlage der Zustimmung des Benutzers ermöglicht. Oauth fokussiert auf die gemeinsame Nutzung der Authentifizierung zwischen Diensten ohne die Angabe von Anmeldeinformationen. OIDC (OpenID Connect ) stellt eine auf OAuth 2.0 aufbauende Schicht dar, die in der Regel für Social Logins (etwa “Sign in with GitHub”) verwendet wird. OIDC enthält einige Erweiterungen gegenüber OAuth, einschließlich Identity Assertions, Userinfo API und Standard Discovery – standardisierte Mechanismen für die sichere Bereitstellung und Nutzung von Identitätsinformationen. Diese Protokolle kommen einzeln oder im Kombination mit anderen Technologien zum Einsatz. So können beispielsweise JSON Web Token verwendet werden, um OAuth 2.0 Credential Token-Informationen in einem sichereren Format zu kapseln. Glücklicherweise ist der Prozess zur Implementierung dieser Protokolle umfassend dokumentiert und wird von einer Vielzahl von Technologie-Stacks unterstützt. Der größte Teil der Arbeit wird durch Abstraktionen auf höherer Ebene in vielen Sprachen und Frameworks gekapselt.

    "title": "Was bei der Cloud-Konfiguration schiefläuft – und wie es besser geht",
    "summary": "Fehlerhaft konfigurierte Cloud-Dienste sorgen regelmäßig für Datenlecks – und schlimmeres. DC Studio | shutterstock.com Konfigurationsfehler in der Cloud, die Unternehmensdaten gefährden, sind nicht unbedingt etwas Neues – eher im Gegenteil . Umso schlimmer, dass Unternehmen ihre Cloud-Ressourcen immer noch nicht durchgängig absichern. Zumindest legt das ein aktueller Report nahe. Dafür hat der Cloud-Sicherheitsanbieter Qualys 101 Cybersecurity- und IT-Profis befragt, zu deren Aufgaben es gehört, Cloud-Umgebungen abzusichern. Demnach: haben 28 Prozent der Befragten im vergangenen Jahr einen Breach in Zusammenhang mit der Cloud oder SaaS-Applikationen verzeichnet. sehen 24 Prozent falsch konfigurierte Services als das größte Risiko für ihre Cloud-Umgebung an. Qualys nahm für seine Studie außerdem rund 44 Millionen virtuelle Maschinen ( VMs ) unter die Lupe, die in Public Clouds gehostet werden. Dabei stellten die Experten fest, dass 45 Prozent der AWS-VMs, 63 Prozent der GCP-VMs und 70 Prozent der Azure-VMs über falsch konfigurierte Ressourcen verfügten. Die häufigsten Cloud-Konfigurationsfehler Laut Ayan Roy , Leiter des Bereichs Cybersicherheit bei EY Americas, aktivieren Unternehmen zwar durchaus bestimmte Cloud-Security-Funktionen, allerdings nicht alle. So blieben Logging, Monitoring und Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung ( MFA ) in vielen Fällen unbeachtet: “Unternehmen wollen schnell vorankommen, und die Time-to-Value ist absolut entscheidend. Wenn Cybersicherheitsteams jedoch nicht in diese Entscheidungen eingebunden werden, beginnen die Probleme. So können die Sicherheitsprofis oft nur nachträglich Maßnahmen ergreifen.” Einen weiteren blinden Fleck in Sachen Cloud Security sieht Roy während Fusionen und Übernahmen . Er mahnt Unternehmen dazu, in solchen Fällen proaktiv vorzugehen: “Führen Sie eine Due Diligence durch, berücksichtigen Sie diese auch und stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie den richtigen Cybersecurity-Investitionsplan haben.” Laut Scott Wheeler , Cloud Practice Lead bei Asperitas, treten mit steigender Unternehmensgröße auch weniger Cloud-Konfigurationsfehler auf. Das liegt laut dem Cloud-Experten vor allem an der Aufsicht durch Regulierungsbehörden. Kleine Firmen hätten hingegen enorme Probleme, da sie weder über das Personal noch die nötigen Tools verfügten, um Risiken im Zusammenhang mit der Cloud-Konfiguration zu managen – etwa exponierte Speicher-Buckets oder Web Services. “Das gesamte Konzept von Zero Trust basiert auf der Tatsache, dass man den Zugriff auf das benötigte Minimum beschränken kann. Aber das ist in der Praxis schwer zu bewerkstelligen”, erklärt Wheeler. Oftmals würden während der Entwicklung Berechtigungen erweitert und nach der Inbetriebnahme nicht wieder zurückgesetzt, wie er beispielhaft anführt. Der regelmäßig größte Fehler, den Wheeler beobachtet, sind jedoch Datenbanken oder andere Cloud-Assets, die über nicht sichere, private Netzwerke kommunizieren. “Viele dieser Services unterstützen das nicht ‘out of the box’. Es erfordert einiges an Arbeit, sie so zu konfigurieren, dass ausschließlich privater Netzwerkverkehr in private Cloud- oder lokale Umgebungen fließt. Das ist ein großes Problem, das oft von kriminellen Hackern ausgenutzt wird.” Und auch wenn viele Anbieter versprechen, dass KI auch Cloud Security einfacher, kostengünstiger und effektiver gestalten wird: Sie sollten nicht damit rechnen, dass Cloud-Konfigurationsprobleme schon morgen der Vergangenheit angehören. Bis KI-Agenten soweit sind, dass sie das zuverlässig übernehmen können, wird noch ein bisschen Zeit ins Land ziehen. 9 Tipps für sicherere Cloud-Konfigurationen Tun können Sie dennoch etwas gegen fehlerhafte Cloud-Konfigurationen. Zum Beispiel: 1. Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung implementieren MFA sollte für jede Form von Cloud-Zugriff zur Anwendung kommen, nicht nur für bestimmte Benutzer. 2. Private Netzwerke für alle Services nutzen Konfigurieren Sie Datenbanken und Cloud-Dienste so, dass sie nur über private Netzwerke und nicht über das öffentliche Internet kommunizieren. 3. Daten verschlüsseln Datenverschlüsselung sollte für alle neuen und bestehenden Ressourcen standardmäßig aktiviert sein. Angesichts des nahenden Quanten-Zeitalters empfiehlt es sich für Unternehmen bereits jetzt auf quantensichere Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen zu setzen, um sich gegen sogenannte “Harvest now, decrypt later”-Angriffe zu schützen. 4. Least-Privilege-Zugriffskontrollen anwenden Benutzern und Systemen Zugriff auf möglichst wenige Ressourcen zu gewähren, ist ein Grundpfeiler moderner Zero-Trust-Sicherheitsprinzipien. Konten mit übermäßigen Berechtigungen können schnell zu Datenverlust führen, wenn sie missbraucht werden. 5. Infrastructure as Code verwenden Wenn Administratoren oder Benutzer Änderungen an Cloud-Konfigurationen in den Cloud-Management-Konsolen vornehmen, ist es oft schwierig, diese nachzuvollziehen – und rückgängig zu machen, wenn etwas schiefgeht. Das Prinzip von Infrastructure as Code hilft an dieser Stelle: Verwenden Sie entsprechende Konfigurationsmanagement-Tools, um sämtliche Änderungen anhand von Richtlinien zu überprüfen, nachzuverfolgen und auditieren zu können. 6. Kontinuierlich scannen Einmal bei der Ersteinrichtung der Cloud-Ressourcen zu überprüfen, ob die Konfigurationen aktuell sind, reicht nicht aus. Unternehmen müssen sicherstellen, dass sich nichts verändert. Zu diesem Zweck haben einige Cloud-Anbieter native Tools im Angebot. Lösungen aus dem Bereich Cloud Security Posture Management ( CSPM ) können außerdem dabei unterstützen, Lücken zu schließen oder Multi-Cloud-Umgebungen zu überwachen. 7. Speicher-Buckets sperren Unsichere Amazon-S3-Buckets waren vor einigen Jahren bei Cyberkriminellen sehr populär – und sind nach wie vor ein gängiges Problem für Unternehmen. Um sicherzustellen, dass der Storage standardmäßig privat ist, empfehlen sich Bucket Policies und -Zugriffskontrollen. 8. Logging und Monitoring einziehen Viele Unternehmen überwachen essenzielle Cloud Services, dabei bleibt Schatten-IT jedoch oft außen vor. Das ist weniger ein technologisches, als vielmehr ein Management-Problem und lässt sich durch bessere Kommunikation mit den Geschäftsbereichen und einen disziplinierteren Ansatz bei der Bereitstellung von Technologien lösen. 9. Security by Design verinnerlichen Integrieren Sie Sicherheit von Anfang an in Ihre Cloud-Architektur – es ist immer deutlich schwieriger, nachträglich aufzurüsten.

We end up copy-pasting answers from old docs, policies, audit reports, and spreadsheets, and still miss things or introduce inconsistencies. It’s slow, painful, and easy to mess up. I’m curious — how are other teams handling this? Are you using spreadsheets, GRC tools, Notion, something else?

    "title": "Best practices for building a multilingual vulnerability dataset (Java priority, Python secondary) for detection + localization (DL filter + LLM analyzer)?",
    "summary": "I’m working on a research project to build a multilingual dataset for software vulnerability detection and localization , with Java as the top priority and Python as a secondary language . The end goal is a two-stage system : Stage 1 (DL filter): high-recall screening to reduce the search space Stage 2 (LLM analyzer): deeper reasoning to reduce false positives and localize vulnerable code (function/line/path) I want to collect data “the right way” so it’s reproducible, legally shareable, and actually useful for training and evaluation. What I’m trying to collect For each sample (Java-first, plus Python), I’m aiming for: Vulnerable code + fixed code (before/after) Mapping to CWE (and optionally CVE/CVSS) Localization labels : vulnerable file(s)/function(s), ideally line-level or hunk-level evidence A mix of real-world and synthetic cases (to cover rare CWEs) Current collection ideas (but I’m unsure about best practice) CVE → repo → fixing commit → diff → affected files/functions/lines Concern: noisy CVE-to-commit mapping, missing links, multi-commit fixes, refactors, backports. Security test suites / synthetic corpora Concern: distribution shift vs real-world code; overfitting to templated patterns. Advisories / vulnerability databases Use NVD/GHSA vendor advisories as metadata, but I’m unsure what pipelines people trust most in practice. Questions for people who’ve built datasets or trained vuln models A) Data sourcing & mapping (Java-heavy) What’s your most reliable pipeline for CVE/CWE ↔ GitHub repo ↔ fixing commit ? Do you anchor on fixing commits or vulnerability-introducing commits ? Why? Heuristics to reduce mapping errors (keyword filters, issue linking rules, tag matching, release notes)? B) Labeling for localization What’s considered “good enough” labeling today? diff-hunk only? line-level? slicing-based labels? source→sink path evidence? How do you handle fixes that are config/build changes or dependency updates (no clear line-level change)? C) Dataset hygiene (leakage prevention) Best practice to prevent leakage via: duplicated code across forks backported patches across branches train/test overlap from the same project/vendor Recommended split strategy: by project , by time , by vendor , or combinations? D) Negative samples How do you sample “clean” code without making labels unreliable? random functions? same files pre-fix? post-fix only? using static analyzers to filter negatives? E) Legal / licensing / redistribution How do you keep the dataset redistributable ? store diffs only? store snippets? store file hashes + scripts to rehydrate from Git? Any licensing pitfalls when publishing curated code excerpts? Constraints / goals Java is the priority language; Python is added for multilingual coverage. Target tasks: detection (vuln/non-vuln) CWE classification (optional) localization (function/line/path) Output: an open dataset + scripts + documentation with reproducibility.

    "title": "These are the AI security concerns and design considerations affecting enterprise projects",
    "summary": "Since leaving my career as a cybersecurity consultant and incident responder, I've been contracting 1-2 days a week with a few different enterprises in the financial sector. My role with them is to work with architects and developers to ensure their new AI projects are secure. These are not SMBs, they're firms with 20,000+ employees. So things here are quite different compared to what's happening at frontier startups (which I'm also involved with!). It's all been a challenge. For a few reasons. But here is a summary of what I've learned over the past 6 months. - AI is no different to any technology project. The biggest issue with these initiatives - by far - continues to be the traditional technology issues we all know about. Secure landing zones. SSDLC. Developer permissions. Peer review processes. Dependency management. AI is being used by developers as an excuse to \"move fast and break things\" and build outside of approved environments. This flexibility is key (and my job is to support that), but it has taken months of work to go from a developer-POC through to a production deployment. Arguably (in my opinion), developers are not doing themselves any favours by pushing for less-restrictive development environments. If they had stuck to approved environments in the first place, and worked with security to handle the exceptions, I think the overall process would have been considerably smoother and the end result better. - The biggest AI-specific security issues have come down to early or unproven technology. Microsoft have really let down the community by releasing tools like Promptflow, and then completely abandoning them. Not only that, there are uncountable issues with Promptflow itself and ultimately despite being very cool and very useful, it's not suited for production environments. But it took some time to work this out, and that was time we wasted. For those interested, everyone I know has basically adopted LLamaIndex as their AI-orchestration layer. It's not perfect, but I can see a world where it becomes the standard. I personally prefer (in my own projects) to use LiteLLM + a custom prompt renderer based on jinja2. I just feel that is far more flexible, and right now, I don't hugely trust what the opensource community is publishing in this space. However, I understand that most developers want a framework to engage with. - All projects I've dealt with have been limited to coarse-grain authorisation. Right now, fine-grain authorisation is a practical impossibility. Take a simple RAG example. You want to be able to query a document store, and, because you're dealing with complex enterprise environments, it's not something \"easy\" like SharePoint. How do you ensure that if Bob queries the AI for data, it doesn't return information from data that Bob doesn't have access to? There are really two primary approaches. You can either ingest all your information from the datastore into your index and include the permission structure. Your AI knows who the user is, and they know what access permissions that user has, which means they can limit their queries accordingly. But it means you have a potentially unacceptable cache invalidation issue. If Bob's permissions change, it will take time for this to be replicated in the index. The second approach would be to use middleware. Your index contains all possible information, your search retrieves what it considers relevant, and then queries the original datastore to workout if Bob shouldn't have access to any of it. The second approach is my preference. But it's considered higher-risk, because you're allowing the agentic search function to query data without restrictions. Furthermore, how do we scale this to accommodate multiple datastores, each potentially backed by different identity providers? We need solutions in this space to architect that middleware layer translating user permissions into agentic query parameters. I'm aware there are several startups in this space. The point I'm trying to make is that enterprises have no interest in solving this problem themselves, they're waiting for other people to solve it. And in the meantime, they're limiting the scope of their projects accordingly. - Classified data poses existential problems. In IT, the person administrating your SharePoint does not (and should not) have access to the actual files. They don't need it. Their job is to manage the tenant, not view your secret data. So what happens when we want AI to access information that's classified? We don't really care that the LLM \"sees\" that information, because the session is ephemeral. The issue is more complex. The developers themselves are not authorised to access that data. So how can they diagnose issues with AI responses, when the input data makes up the majority of the prompt? How do we spot hallucinations? If the input data is classified, does that mean the output data is also classified? These are serious problems! I don't have any solutions right now. I've speculated about a process whereby classified information is logged but encrypted at rest. When a developer wants to access that information to diagnose an event, they can request access and decrypt the data. This would mean there is a strong audit trail of who sees what, and we can tie the access request to a business justification for accessing that content. But it's still not ideal. The second method I've played around with is focusing instead on quantifying the performance of the AI. For example, can we develop a machine learning model that provides output floats modelling the hallucination likelihood or the overall quality of the AI response? Such a framework would provide the developers with information about the session performance without needing to access the underlying data. I haven't come across any startups yet in that space. But I'm also not convinced it's a workable idea. - I'm not going to talk about MCP! I personally do not believe in it, and I'm challenging any developers who build solutions that involve it. However, there is a much larger security point here about how we log and audit unattended user actions. My initial security theories about MCP were pretty simple. If Alice has access to Jira (for example), and can create/read/modify content there legitimately - why do we care if she uses MCP (or equivalent) to perform actions she's already authorised to perform? I didn't really see an issue with users sharing their permissions in this way. It's no different than them automating part of their work using a python script. However, the release of agentic browsers in particular has changed that conversation a bit. The potential for unattended and unguided user actions is now very high, and this create a real issue for security telemetry. We simply do not know if an action has been performed by a user or an agent anymore. That's highly concerning, and I think is a real issue we need solutions for. It's difficult to say exactly how this can be done. We already have standards for logging machine-to-machine connections with something like an `impersonating` or `on-behalf-of-user` field. But when agents are interacting in the front end, there's no mechanism for them to pass that information through to the server. Perhaps instead of Captchas, we need to accept that agents will become the norm and require them to acknowledge that \"they are a robot\". Then the session telemetry can appropriately capture the information we need. ---- Hopefully this all makes sense! Would love to hear about what other people are dealing with and whether any of this resonates. submitted by /u/QoTSankgreall [link] [comments]",

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/HeaNJErRuXI The \"Anti-Hallucination\" Update Instead of blindly sending Nmap output to an LLM, I built a Pattern Matching Engine (in Python) that parses the scan before the AI sees it. Hallucination Blocking: If you ask the Syd about a service (e.g., \"How do I exploit SMB?\") that does not exist in the actual Nmap scan, the engine detects the mismatch and blocks the response. It refuses to lie to you. Risk Scoring: It parses the flags and versions to differentiate between a \"Low Risk\" Port 80 (Default Apache) and a \"High Risk\" Port 445 (SMB Signing Disabled).Quiet Indicators: It specifically highlights \"quiet\" risks that LLMs often miss, like Port 111 (RPC) or Port 631 (CUPS). The Test I tested it against a vulnerable Windows Domain Controller (10.10.10.20). Generic AI: Often misses context or hallucinates extra services. Syd correctly identified it as a DC, flagged the lack of SMB signing (Relay Attack risk), and refused to answer questions about services that weren't there. This is currently just for Nmap analysis, but I'm working on adding BloodHound and Volatility 3 modules next hopefully today and this will be open source and completley free of charge the video is quite long and i hate the sound of my accent but it needs to be long because there are 30 questions that i asked syd about the scan and i also asked some generic questions, i would sugest pausing the video and reading the answers he gives and remember this is 100% airgapped id love feed back on this and he will be on github today submitted by /u/Glass-Ant-6041 [link] [comments]",

I’m curious is to how far a I need to go for an exploit. Like is it only for remote initial access PoCs? Probably a dumb question but I had to bypass some hardware security and didn’t know if getting around a U boot login to actually dump the firmware is something they care about or if it’s everything that comes after firmware access that they truly care about? I know an old coworker who did bug hunting on the side on routers and he likes to stick to a specific brand because all of the bugs he finds follows a rubric. I want to do the same thing with this relatively unknown brand that’s spread widely across the country here. I’ve seen these routers in every house or business I have visited and think it would be cool. Feels a little like uncharted territory because I don’t see a lot of exploits for this company’s devices on the web and their firmware is not public. Maybe others are hunting on this but I don’t think it would be a lot given how underdeveloped the cyber industry here is. submitted by /u/Green-Detective7142 [link] [comments]",

So I've set up a shell script that will collect all 404 errors on the server and total hits by IP address. The script then detects who controls the IP address, and if it's Microsoft, it emails a report to [ abuse@microsoft.com ](mailto: abuse@microsoft.com ) when an IP hits 100 404 errors across all websites on the server. I have this script running every 15 minutes. I've never received any responses for the emails sent to [ abuse@microsoft.com ](mailto: abuse@microsoft.com ). In the past 24 hours, 56 Microsoft identified IPs were conducting probing attacks. The problem is that this never ends. The IPs constantly shift. Previously, I was manually blocking by /24 blocks, but it was too much work to constantly be adding blocks to the firewall, so the script is supposed to handle this, but the attacks and high server load continue. I literally just temporarily blocked 4.0.0.0/8 and 20.0.0.0/8 just to kill off an attack. MS has many blocks in those two subnets. Usually, about five times a day, my server is unavailable or degraded due to these probing attacks. A couple days ago, that was ten times that the server was bogged down with these attacks. This wasn't a problem a couple years ago, but now it's a major issue. Conversely, when I report these to AWS or Google, they are dealt with quickly. I've tried to figure out a way to speak with someone at MS about this. I called the number listed with ICANN and managed to figure out how to search by name, and by trying common last names found actual extensions to call (as well as conference rooms). I have yet to actually connect with a human doing this, even when calling someone's direct extension. I've found others complaining on Microsoft's help forums, and the MS response completely got it wrong, thinking that the their Azure server was being attacked, not that Azure IPs were attacking an outside server. When corrected on this, the MS rep said that they needed an Azure account for help in that matter (completely sidestepping the issue).

Most decks seem to be for Sec+ or Pentest+, but I'm hoping for something more targeted on these practical exams and the tools they teach. Would also be interested in any bug bounty related decks. I've just completed the TryHackMe Cybersec101 path recently, and I'm working on JrPentest before taking the PT1. I have fairly extensive notes. However, I'm still worried about remembering everything properly once I get to the exam. Purely due to the sheer amount of information + categories of information, and the fact that I have very strict goals I'm trying to meet (so I'm digesting it as fast as I can) I wanted to look into making flashcards to help me study to help me retain information and give me a more productive way to spend my commutes to/from work. However, I'm using almost all of my free time at home studying as is while working full time, and don't want to slack on making good flashcards. So before I add creating flashcards to my note making process, I wanted to check here. submitted by /u/SunlightBladee [link] [comments]",

For backstory, i’ve been an analyst for 2.5 years. I mentioned to my manager I want to look towards becoming a senior analyst down the road. What confuses me (and my manager) is that they don’t have a roadmap/plan for what would imply from going from regular to senior. My review stated I excelled for almost all categories, so, I got a decent raise. However since there is no ‘goalpost’ for what brings you to senior, I don’t know (nor management) what would classify a senior analyst. My question to the community is- what (in your opinion) are topics, tasks, knowledge, etc should/would distinguish someone from a ‘analyst’ to ‘senior’ analyst?

    "summary": "I’m not pitching or selling anything here — genuinely trying to stress-test the idea before going further. Brutal honesty welcome :D ####### I’m working on an idea for a crowdsourced SOC alert triage platform , and I’d really like feedback from people who’ve worked in SOCs, MDRs, IR teams, or built security products. The problem I’m trying to solve Most SOCs I’ve seen are: Drowning in alerts (often ~60–70% false positives) Struggling to hire/retain analysts (cost + burnout) Forced to choose between 24/7 coverage and budget reality Spending senior analyst time on low-value triage work Automation helps, but fully automated triage still misses nuance and creates risk. The core idea A global, on-demand SOC triage platform where: Sensitive information within the alert is redacted (never raw logs) Real human analysts triage alerts (L1/L2/L3) Verdicts are returned quickly (FP / TP / needs escalation) Companies pay per alert or via subscription The key principle: human judgment, without exposing sensitive data . How it would work (high level) A lightweight, open-source agent integrates with an existing SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, etc.) Redaction happens client-side , before anything leaves the company Only the specific alert context is shared (not full log streams) Alerts go into a queue Vetted analysts pick them up, triage, and submit a verdict Results flow back to the client SOC Redaction & privacy (this is the main differentiator) The platform is built around smart, context-aware redaction : Usernames, emails → replaced with placeholders IPs → masked or partially masked Secrets, tokens, passwords → auto-detected (regex/YARA-like rules) Command lines → sensitive substrings redacted, not entire fields (e.g. keep mimikatz.exe , redact -p MySecret123 ) Clients can define custom redaction rules per field or log source Clients see a preview of exactly what analysts will see No raw logs, no full environments, no PII by default. Trust & quality controls To avoid “random internet analysts” problems: Analysts must register, pass technical tests, KYC, and NDAs Tiered analysts (L1/L2/L3) Reputation system based on accuracy, speed, and client feedback Time limits per alert (idle alerts auto-returned) Random quality checks and audits Underperformance leads to demotion or removal Clients also retain control: Decline info requests Resolve alerts internally Escalate to senior analysts Full audit trail of who accessed what Compliance angle Designed with GDPR/CCPA in mind: Client remains data controller Platform is processor Regional analyst pools (EU-only, etc.) Configurable retention / auto-deletion Human-in-the-loop (no purely automated decisions) The open questions (where I want Reddit’s help) Would SOC teams actually trust this model? Is client-side redaction + partial context enough for good triage? (should the redaction happen before the alert reaches the platform or after ) Where do you see this breaking down in real life? Would MDRs see this as competition, or as overflow capacity? Is this solving a real pain, or just shifting it? submitted by /u/Main-Sweet-5735 [link] [comments]",

My friend and I scoped online to see if there were any options of solving this. There were some websites that detect AI on videos but they need to be uploaded, and YT videos can’t be downloaded in a legal way. As for the deepfake image detectors, I think that would be too inconvenient for the user, and often I would use snipping tool from the video, feed it into the program and it would detect no AI generated content. Would it be much easier to paste a video link and get a probability that the content is AI generated? since I assume people don’t like to be fooled into thinking they are watching something real when it really is not.

It’s an educational framework meant to strip away the complexity of tools like Cobalt Strike and show the bare-bones logic of an implant/server relationship. I documented the build process in a new video where I cover: HTTPS Beaconing: Using browser impersonation to blend into traffic. Socket Bridging: The logic behind \"proxying\" a remote shell through a middleman server. Persistence: How the implant handles systemd service injection. Everything is open-source (MIT License) and written in C++23. The goal isn't to create \"undetectable\" malware, but to provide a solid, readable base for students and researchers to build their own modules on.

Sometimes when I am leading the calls with clients, I get responses from them that I am unfamiliar with(e.g., use of unfamiliar tools or in unfamiliar ways) and I become nervous or I don’t know how to follow up exactly. I still don’t understand what’s the difference between the qualified and underqualified in this field, especially because a lot of it seems like common sense.Also, sometimes I question what skill should I really be focusing on building up(especially if a lot of the knowledge is available via the AI Chatbots).

AI guardrails are not a complete security solution and are frequently bypassed by sophisticated attacks.

Does AI Cyber Security morf into the new name, like “Adversarial robustness” I'm not seeing much alignment here with traditional cybersecurity skills. If prompt injection really is the top OWASP Agent risk, a big part of securing these agents will be a layered / mixed approach since no single technique “solves” prompt injection. You reduce risk by combining (1) least privilege, (2) runtime detection + enforcement, (3) tool-call controls, (4) data-loss controls, and (5) monitoring + governance — plus (6) AI threat modeling, (7) context trust-boundaries/provenance, (8) memory hygiene, (9) red-teaming + continuous evaluation, (10) human-in-the-loop gating for high-impact actions, (11) tool supply-chain hardening via gateways/catalogs, and (12) agent identity + incident response integration. submitted by /u/kev0406 [link] [comments]",

I don't know about other countries, but if you want to get into cyber, there are only two things you should have: either some experience in IT fields or a better recognition certificate (paid one, of course). If you don't have either, like a fresher or you don't have money to pursue those certs, the reality is you can't get in, no matter how much projects you have made, no matter how much hands-on experience you will get on multiple skills. It's not about particularly SOC or cloud security, it's about all fields. I am trying literally for 5–6 months, daily applying to up to 100 companies a day, and since then I was not able to get my resume shortlisted. No, it's not about my resume being bad or not having keywords, as a fresher I really do have a better resume than that. But they only want those two things only. After applying for months, I get a chance to get a cybersecurity intern role in a, let's say, XYZ company, and it's a good company, not like a little organisation. The HR called me and said we have scheduled your interview, but later on the interview day, HR called me and said we have to reschedule. Again, on the rescheduled day, I get a call and they said the panel is not available, and this time they didn't give me any reschedule. Hence, it clearly shows they don't want me right now. I really had a hope with this organisation that now I can for sure start my career, but again it shows that as a fresher you really don't have any value. ;) I tried to do other fields, but what led me into cyber is that I like it. Upon contacting and trying to make a network through people on LinkedIn, trust me, you will only waste your time. Neither one person out of 800 helped me. Later on, they all said move on to some other field, later on jump, and I was stunned. Like, if I wanted to do other things, why would I even enter into cyber? But you know guys, after such things, I am getting tired. I don't have it left in me anymore to continue cyber. So if you are a fresher, you can get a job only if you are lucky, nothing else. And as a fresher, I don't mean you had done an internship. I had a 6 months+ internship period, which really, you know, didn't hold a value. So that's all. I really wanted to open up, so I came here. :) submitted by /u/Comfortable-Mine-729 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Looking for fitting mystery guest certification",
    "summary": "Hi everyone, I’m a 24-year-old cybersecurity and information security consultant working for a company in the Netherlands. I hold an HBO-level education and my main area of expertise is social engineering, with a strong focus on mystery guest and physical security assessments for clients. Currently, I’m the only employee performing these types of projects. Our team was reduced from six people to just me, mainly to move away from multiple individual working styles and to allow the others to focus on long-term projects such as (C)ISO-related work. Regarding physical security, my goal is to move toward an approach where I not only perform the physical tests (such as mystery guest or intrusion-style assessments), but also expand into providing advisory input on the theoretical and organizational side based on the findings. At the moment, my role is limited to executing the assessments and delivering the final report. I’d like to further develop my skills and deepen my expertise by obtaining a certification this year (or however long it realistically takes). However, I’m finding it difficult to identify certifications that truly fit this niche. I’ve broadened my search beyond mystery guest and physical security to certifications focused on social engineering, ideally including the psychological or human-factor aspects, while still remaining rooted in security testing. OSINT certs like added aren’t relevant enough, since there isn’t enough interest from clients. Most psychology-oriented certifications are unfortunately not an option for me, as they require an HBO diploma with a psychology background. My background is in cybersecurity, and I’d prefer something that builds on that. Practical constraints: • Budget: ~€5,000 (with some flexibility if there’s a strong case) • Time: I work full-time (40 hours), run my own business on the side, and have a private life, so anything requiring extreme workloads (e.g. 100+ hours/week) is not realistic • Format: Online is preferred unless the training is located in the Netherlands or nearby regions in Belgium or Germany • Language: English or Dutch I don’t currently hold any certifications in this specific area. Does anyone have experience with certifications related to social engineering, human factors, or physical security testing that would fit this profile? Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated. submitted by /u/Joepus16 [link] [comments]",

I noticed the production key files (public and private) were almost identical size. I re-exported the public key from my local machine, and noticed the key blocks do not match. The public key block in question is about double the size of the one I just exported. For the life of me, I can't figure out what went wrong the first time I exported.

    "summary": "Spent few days analysing MongoDB, please summarize the analysis and findings. MongoBleed, tracked as CVE-2025-14847, an unauthenticated memory disclosure vulnerability affecting MongoDB across multiple major versions. It allows remote clients to extract uninitialized heap memory from the MongoDB process using nothing more than valid compressed wire-protocol messages. This is not native RCE . This is not an issue on the library zlib, is more on the compression-decompression and It is a memory leak. It does not leave a lot of traces, It is silent, repeatable, and reachable before authentication. TL;DR for engineering teams What broke MongoDB’s zlib decompression path trusts attacker-controlled length metadata. Impact Unauthenticated heap memory disclosure. What leaks Raw process memory fragments including credentials, tokens, config strings, runtime metadata, and recently processed data. Auth required None. Noise level Low. No crashes. No malformed packets. Minimal logs. Exposure 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances observed via Shodan on 29 Dec 2025. Fix Upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression. Reality check Public PoC exists. Scanning is trivial. Exploitation effort is low (links below on the exploit lab, explaination and scanners if you want to find yours Links - Full Detailed Blog: https://phoenix.security/mongobleed-vulnerability-cve-2025-14847/ - Exploit explanation and lab: https://youtu.be/EZ4euRyDI8I - Exploit Description (llm generated from article): https://youtu.be/lxfNSICAaSc - Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main - Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner - Github Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca (Note I spend more time writing exploits, have dyslexia, and I'm not a native English, an LLM proofreads some sections, if this offends you, stop reading) Affected versions MongoDB Server Vulnerable versions Fixed versions 8.2.x 8.2.0 – 8.2.2 8.2.3 8.0.x 8.0.0 – 8.0.16 8.0.17 7.0.x 7.0.0 – 7.0.27 7.0.28 6.0.x 6.0.0 – 6.0.26 6.0.27 5.0.x 5.0.0 – 5.0.31 5.0.32 4.4.x 4.4.0 – 4.4.29 4.4.30 4.2.x All EOL 4.0.x All EOL 3.6.x All EOL SAAS version of MongoDB is already patched Technical anatomy MongoDB supports network-level message compression. When a client negotiates compression, each compressed message includes an uncompressedSize field. The vulnerable flow looks like this: Client sends a syntactically valid compressed MongoDB wire-protocol message Message declares an inflated uncompressedSize MongoDB allocates a heap buffer of that declared size zlib inflates only the real payload into the start of the buffer The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON BSON parsing walks past real data into leftover heap memory Memory gets leaked out, not a lot of IOC to detect Root cause (code-level) The vulnerability originates in MongoDB’s zlib message decompression logic: src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cpp In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returned: return {output.length()}; output.length() represents the allocated buffer size , not the number of bytes actually written by ::uncompress(). If the attacker declares a larger uncompressedSize than the real decompressed payload, MongoDB propagates the allocated size forward. Downstream BSON parsing logic consumes memory beyond the true decompression boundary. The fix replaces this with: return length; length is the actual number of bytes written by the decompressor. Additional regression tests were added in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly reject undersized decompression results with ErrorCodes::BadValue. This closes the disclosure path. Why is this reachable pre-auth Compression negotiation occurs before authentication. The exploit does not require: malformed compression streams memory corruption primitives race conditions timing dependencies It relies on: attacker-controlled metadata valid compression Incorrect length propagation Any network client can trigger it, hence is super easy to deploy Exploitation reality A working proof of concept exists and is public, more details: Original PoC by Joe Desimone https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed/ Technical analysis and reproduction details https://doublepulsar.com/merry-christmas-day-have-a-mongodb-security-incident-9537f54289eb Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca The PoC: negotiates compression sends crafted compressed messages iterates offsets dumps leaked memory fragments to disk and saves it locally No credentials required. No malformed packets. Repeatable probing. What actually leaks Heap memory is messy. That is the point. Observed and expected leak content includes: database credentials SCRAM material session tokens API keys WiredTiger config strings file paths container metadata client IPs and connection details fragments of recently processed documents The PoC output already shows real runtime artifacts. This is not RCE, but steals pieces of memory, which is not as bad as RCE but still very dangerous (Heartbleed anyone) MongoBleed does not provide native remote code execution. There is no instruction pointer control. No shellcode injection. No crash exploitation. What it provides is privilege discovery . Memory disclosure enables: credential reuse token replay service-to-service authentication CI/CD compromise cloud control plane access A leaked Kubernetes token is better than RCE. A leaked CI token is persistent RCE. A leaked cloud role is full environment control. This is RCE-adjacent through legitimate interfaces. How widespread is this MongoDB is everywhere. Shodan telemetry captured on 29 December 2025 shows: 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances Version breakdown (port 27017): Version Count Query All versions 201,659 product:\"MongoDB\" port:27017 8.2.x 3,164 \"8.2.\" 8.0.x (≠8.0.17) 13,411 \"8.0.\" -\"8.0.17\" 7.0.x (≠7.0.28) 19,223 \"7.0.\" -\"7.0.28\" 6.0.x (≠6.0.27) 3,672 \"6.0.\" -\"6.0.27\" 5.0.x (≠5.0.32) 1,887 \"5.0.\" -\"5.0.32\" 4.4.x (≠4.4.30) 3,231 \"4.4.\" -\"4.4.30\" 4.2.x 3,138 \"4.2.\" 4.0.x 3,145 \"4.0.\" 3.6.x 1,145 \"3.6.\" Most are directly exposed on the default port, not shielded behind application tiers. Core behaviors that matter Unauthenticated Any client can trigger it. Remote and repeatable Memory offsets can be probed over time. Low noise No crashes. Logs stay quiet. Data agnostic Whatever was on the heap becomes fair game. This favors patient actors and automation. Detection guidance IOC Identification Network-level signals Look for: Inbound traffic to port 27017 compressed MongoDB messages Repeated requests with: large declared uncompressedSize small actual payloads high request frequency without auth attempts Process-level signals Watch for: elevated CPU on mongod without query load repeated short-lived connections memory allocation spikes abnormal BSON parsing warnings Post-leak fallout Check for: new MongoDB users role changes admin command usage anomalies auth attempts from unfamiliar IPs API key failures cloud IAM abuse new outbound connections If you see filesystem artifacts or shells, you are already past exploitation. Temporary protections If you cannot upgrade immediately: Disable zlib compression Remove zlib from networkMessageCompressors Restrict network access Remove direct internet exposure Enforce allowlists These are stopgaps. The bug lives in the server - hence patch Tooling and validation A full test suite is available, combining: exploit lab (vulnerable + patched instances) network scanner code scanner for repos and Dockerfiles Repository: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847 This allows: safe reproduction exposure validation pre-deployment detection Why this one matters MongoBleed does not break crypto it breaks data and memory The database trusts client-supplied lengths. Attackers live for that assumption. Databases are part of your application attack surface. Infrastructure bugs leak application secrets. Vulnerability management without reachability is incomplete. Patch this. Then ask why it was reachable. submitted by /u/Diligent-Side4917 [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Context: attack surface reduction through disablement of gpu reliance. Process affected: Supermium 138 (chrome.exe). Action used: --disable-gpu in shortcut flags. Verification of gpu disablement: chrome://gpu. Observation and Mismatch: the Chrome settings indicate that hardware-assisted GPU acceleration is active despite the starting flag disables the GPU. If the action for disabling GPU acceleration is performed manually, after initiating chrome through the command-line flag that disabled the GPU, the UI for GPU acceleration is reset to active at every start of the browser. Discovery: enforcement occurs at process creation time, not policy declaration time. Boundary: GPU usage is enforced by process initiation and flag evaluation, with UI indicators being non-authoritative. Internal thoughts: Initially I assumed it a mistake, because the UI is not updated even if the policy is enforced elsewhere. Afterwards, I asked a cybersecurity architect for his opinion and he mentioned that this is the intentional design, because flags prevent tampering inside the process at run-time. submitted by /u/themagicalfire [link] [comments]",

Feel free to correct me or add something in the comments! Disclaimer 2: This post is hand-crafted! Don’t make my immaculate formatting skills fool you into thinking it’s AI! Some time ago, my post about children as young as seven being referred to Britain's national cybercrime intervention programme blew up. The discussion in the comments (particularly around parental responsibility) inspired me to compile this list of beginner-friendly cybersecurity resources you can share with your kids or anyone who wants to start their career in the industry. Hands-On Learning Platforms: TryHackMe - Needs no introduction. Offers everything from Windows/Linux fundamentals to professional-grade content. Free tier available with 1-hour daily VM access, paid version $7.35 or $16.99, depending on the monthly/annual subscription. HackTheBox - Another industry-leading hands-on learning platform. Haven’t found the personal plans, though, but I remember there was one (have they pivoted into enterprise entirely?) OverTheWire - Gamified labs (requires basic Linux terminal knowledge) KC7 - Another platform for hands-on practice, a free cyber detective game Pwn College - Platform by ASU for vulnerability research HexTree - An Additional learning platform where you can test real websites to find the flags Kusto Detective Agency - For learning KQL (Kusto Query Language) Capture the flag: CTFTime (for lists of online competitions), PicoCTF - Great for CTF challenges YouTube Channels: PowerCert Animated Videos - Really good infographics for networking concepts Branch Education - Technical explanations on how tech works from the inside Sunny Classroom - Educational content by Associate Professor of the Cybersecurity Program at the University of Saint Mary NetworkChuck - Has a \"Hacker's Roadmap\" series and other cybersecurity content (note: videos can be ad-heavy and jump around topics) Professor Messer - A+ courses and other IT fundamentals Online Courses (Free/Low-Cost): Google Cybersecurity Course (Coursera/Grow.Google) - Beginner-friendly, certification available at a low cost ISC2 CC Certification - Currently offering free training and certification Cisco Skills for All - Free courses in cybersecurity, threat management, and networking Cisco Ethical Hacker Course - 70-hour free course Security Blue Team - Free courses and entry-level Blue Team Level 1 cert (practical and open book) The Cyber Mentor Academy - Free practical help desk training Black Hills Information Security - Free resources, including the Information Security Survival Guide series PortSwigger Web Security Academy - Excellent for web security Hacker High School - Designed specifically for young learners Books: \"The Cuckoo's Egg\" by Cliff Stoll - Story of one of the first international hacks, excellent for understanding infosec foundations GitHub Resources: Search for \"Awesome\" lists: Awesome CTF , Awesome Hacking , Awesome Pentest , Awesome Security , etc. Cybersources repo - Comprehensive collection of beginner resources General Advice: Learn computer hardware first - open up a PC, identify components, and understand what each does. Study operating systems (Windows and Linux basics). Master networking fundamentals, including the OSI model. Understand cybersecurity isn't entry-level - it builds on solid IT and computer science knowledge Programming & Scripting: Learn Python - teaches proper fundamentals and is widely used in cybersecurity Consider Codecademy for structured coding lessons Focus on understanding algorithms, data structures, and abstract thinking Learn SQL and PowerShell - critical for security analyst work Learning Philosophy: Cybersecurity requires understanding how and why tools work, not just using them Build projects, break things in safe environments, and ask questions Don't just rush into \"hacking\" - master the underlying technologies first Consider CompTIA certs as milestones: ITF+/A+ → Network+ → Security+ Practical Tips: Let curiosity drive learning rather than force-feeding information Join computer clubs at school if available Practice in virtualized environments to avoid damaging systems Engage in CTF competitions when ready Consider robotics camps or coding camps for hands-on experience Certifications to Consider (in order): CompTIA ITF+ or A+ (fundamentals) CompTIA Network+ CompTIA Security+ (minimum for many IT jobs) ISC2 CC (free!)

We don't currently have one, so the company is a bit up in the air when it comes to job description and what they expect from the role. However, they've picked me out as a candidate for the role. It was said that they don't want me to leave the company and think this is a good opportunity, which it is. Although, I don't have any degree, qualifications or any proper experience within the Cyber field.. I'm 23 in the UK and my current job role is 'IT Support Technician', however it doesn't reflect what I do at all. My job consists of managing the network, backups, sharepoint, helpdesk, automation development, the whole Microsoft stack as well as other bits. So pretty varied. Company politics is why I'm still an IT Support Tech. The company is a great one to work for, pay is decent and they clearly think I do a good job since they're trying to promote me. The company has said they're happy to pay and have me do pretty much any relevant course or training or degree etc. However, as they haven't had a role like this before, they're leaving it up to me choose what to put myself on. They've said for me to come to them in the new year with a sort of rough plan and we can finalise things and get things set in motion. Hopefully you're not bored reading all of that, now my real question is what sort of certifications, qualifications etc are out there for me to do? and which ones do you recommend for my circumstance? I'm not wanting to go down the degree route as I don't want to tie myself down so was thinking more along the lines of a qualification or cert, but I'm just not sure whats out there or where to start looking. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks :) submitted by /u/lukedurston_ [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Snapshot: Predictions for 2026: AI Attack Acceleration, Automated Remediation, Custom-Made AI Security Tools, Machine Identity Threats, and More",
    "summary": "In this special edition, Tenable leaders forecast key 2026 trends, including: AI will make attacks more plentiful and less costly; machine identities will become the top cloud risk; preemptive cloud and exposure management will dethrone runtime detection; and automated remediation gets the go-ahead. Key takeaways AI will supercharge the speed and volume of traditional cyber attacks rather than creating new vectors, making basic cyber hygiene and proactive prevention the best lines of defense. To combat burnout and inefficient workflows, CISOs will look beyond commercial off-the-shelf solutions and begin building custom in-house AI tools tailored to their organization’s specific needs. Non-human identities (NHIs) will become the primary vector for cloud breaches, necessitating a shift toward strict permissions governance and automatic remediation. 1 - AI won’t spawn new attack vectors in 2026 Is artificial intelligence (AI) about to unleash a wave of never-before-seen cyber attacks? Not quite. While the hype machine might suggest otherwise, the reality for 2026 is grounded in a familiar truth: most bad actors are opportunists looking for low-hanging fruit. They don’t want to reinvent the wheel. Rather, they’re looking for easy wins that yield big gains with minimal effort. “AI is not a magic wand; it supercharges traditional attack methods,” Tenable Chief Product Officer Eric Doerr says. “It will drive down the cost of attack generation and increase the volume, and it might even find a new zero day or two, but it’s not finding novel attack techniques.” In response, cyber teams should double down on foundational cybersecurity practices to combat these high-volume, AI-enhanced threats. Tenable Chief Product Officer Eric Doerr As Doerr explains: \"At the end of the day, cybersecurity is a numbers game and AI broadens attackers’ canvas. Basic cyber hygiene remains the best defense.\" Prediction: In 2026, as attackers increase their use of AI, cyber attacks will grow in number and become less expensive to launch. However, attackers won’t leverage AI to create new attack vectors. 2 - Automatic remediation will get the green light For years, the idea of letting a machine automatically fix a security issue has been considered verboten. But in 2026, can we afford to keep \"automatic\" on the forbidden list? The expanding attack surface and the velocity of threats are forcing a reevaluation of this well-established no-no. “Automatic remediation, mobilization, and mitigation are no longer forbidden,” Tenable Chief Security Officer Robert Huber says. Embracing automation not just for detection, but for the actual fixing of problems, represents a major cultural change in cybersecurity, moving trust from human hands to automated systems. Tenable Chief Security Officer Robert Huber “For years, teams have been hesitant to automatically remediate, but I believe that to keep pace with the threat and expansion of the attack surface, teams will start to defy that long-held belief that automatic is forbidden,” he adds. Prediction: In 2026, teams will rethink the tenet that automatic remediation is too risky to implement, as manual remediation proves unsustainable for most organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve and manage their cyber risk effectively without overwhelming their security pros. 3 - Cloud security focus shifts from runtime detection to prevention-first strategies Is the industry finally moving past the idea that runtime detection is a silver bullet? We think so. Heading into 2026, security leaders are increasingly recognizing that many cloud breaches begin well before runtime, and will look to build a resilient defense via a broader, preemptive approach. “The 2025 hype that runtime detection is the only thing that matters and could replace posture or identity analysis will fade in 2026,” says Liat Hayun, Tenable Senior Vice President of Product Management and Research. Liat Hayun, Tenable Senior Vice President of Product Management and Research “Runtime-only tools miss most attack paths because identity abuse and misconfigurations occur long before anything reaches runtime. Runtime will remain important, but it won’t replace CNAPP or exposure management – it’ll be another data source inside a broader prevention-first approach,” she adds. Prediction: The narrative that runtime detection can supersede identity and posture analysis will rapidly lose steam in 2026. Instead, runtime tools will function as a complementary data input, reinforcing a security architecture that is anchored on a CNAPP and an exposure management platform and that preemptively identifies and mitigates risks . 4 - Acceleration becomes the single biggest threat to your organization Can your security team move faster than a lightning-quick AI-driven attack? In 2026, attack speed will become the greatest challenge for cyber defenders. As attackers leverage automation to compress the attack lifecycle, the window for effective response shrinks. “The who, what, how, and why of an attack don’t matter because AI-fueled attacks start and end before a ticket is even created,” Doerr says. That’s why organizations must make it a priority to quickly set up preemptive security programs. Otherwise, they leave themselves exposed to cyber risks that traditional, reactive methods simply can’t mitigate. “Proactive defense makes speed obsolete,” he says. Prediction: In 2026, AI-fueled acceleration will become adversaries’ primary weapon, rendering reactive security measures ineffective. In response, cyber teams must shift to proactive cyber prevention , which eliminates exposures before they can be exploited, neutralizing the speed advantage that AI provides to cyber criminals. 5 - CISOs will embrace AI security tools built in-house As we move past the novelty phase of generative AI, 2026 will mark a shift toward the utility of agentic AI, and with it a growing appreciation for custom-made AI security tools tailored for an organization’s specific needs. Complementing off-the-shelf AI products with tools built in-house will allow for more precise, effective security workflows and processes that can lessen the burden on overworked cyber pros. “When implemented and designed with care, custom-made AI tools will transform security operations and alleviate pain points that lead to burnout,” Huber says. Prediction: In 2026, rather than relying solely on commercial AI security tools, CISOs will direct their teams to build their own AI wares tailored to their organization's unique challenges. These customized AI tools will, in turn, sharpen their cybersecurity programs and lighten the workload on their staff. 6 - Non-human identities will become the top cloud breach vector Machine identities now outnumber human users by many orders of magnitude. This explosion of non-human identities (NHIs) is creating a massive, stealthy attack surface. In 2026, these billions of service accounts, keys, and tokens are set to become the primary vector for cloud breaches. “The core problem is no longer misconfigs or missing patches. It’ll be billions of unseen, over-permissioned machine identities that attackers – or autonomous agentic AI – will leverage for silent, undetectable lateral movement,” Hayun says. “CISOs will be forced to pivot massive spending toward permissions governance and large-scale cleanup as machine-identity sprawl has rendered cloud environments truly unmanageable,” she adds. Prediction: NHIs will decisively become the number one cloud breach vector in 2026, a trend driven by myriad machine identities with excessive privileges. As a result, CISOs will need to prioritize getting this vast landscape of machine identities under control by strengthening identity and access management (IAM) governance and execution.",

They will be sentenced on March 12, 2026, the US Department of Justice announced this week. Ryan Goldberg and Kevin Martin were charged with using the BlackCat ransomware against multiple victims in the US between April 2023 and December 2023. An unnamed co-consiprator was also listed in the court filings . They were accused of targeting five companies with the ransomware: a Florida medical device company, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office in California, an engineering company in California, and a drone manufacturer in Virginia. BlackCat ransomware, also known as ALPHV, is particularly pernicious as it can exploit cloud copies of data intended to protect against ransomware attacks as a way into the enterprise. Those behind it are among the most dangerous ransomware groups active today . Goldberg and Martin didn’t develop BlackCat, though: they identified victims and targeted them with the ransomware-as-a-service , sharing ransom payouts with the developers. The two reached plea agreements with the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida on Dec. 18, 2025, and these were accepted by the US District Court for the Southern District fo Florida on Dec. 29, court records show. The ransomware attacks resulted in losses exceeding $9.5 million, the parties agreed. However, authorities were only able to trace $324,123.26 in proceeds of the crimes to Goldberg and Martin, according to the plea agreements. The pair face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. US authorities have been after them and the developers of the BlackCat software they used for years. The wider ransomware group is believed to have targeted more than 1,000 victims around the world, according to a DOJ news release . The group was defanged in December 2023, when the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) developed a tool that could decrypt data held to ransom, according ot the DOJ. It estimated this saved hundreds of victims some $99 million in ransomware payments.",

In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past.

    "summary": "Financial Times , 2 January 2026 Some quotes below: Europe is so far behind the US in digital infrastructure it has “lost the internet”, a top European cyber enforcer has warned. Miguel De Bruycker, director of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB), told the Financial Times that it was “currently impossible” to store data fully in Europe because US companies dominate digital infrastructure. “We’ve lost the whole cloud. We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.” The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said. [...] Europe needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation. He suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies. It could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on [an] EU level in the cyber domain.” submitted by /u/vanderbeeken [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Hi all, I have recently joined a company that is past the maturity mark of a startup but still an early stage company. I am in a multiple-hat security role as you can expect with it being a startup. It’s in a heavily regulated industry and pretty much everything is SaaS where possible. There is minimal infrastructure fully under our control. Since this startup is already relatively mature in the security sense (MFA, CA policies, SSO where possible, Vuln scanning, Code scanning etc.), I’m finding it difficult to know what to focus on next, what to implement, what to review, or where I can add value, especially after having already reviewed most of the existing configuration and setup. It feels like there’s simply less (almost no) active security work to be doing, and I feel unproductive because of it. My previous company was a much more mature ~10k user hybrid environment where there was always work to be done, big improvement projects, more incidents etc. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do, what are your thoughts etc? I’m going to upskill with some training in the meantime. I should also mention this job is a significant salary and benefit increase which is why I’d like to improve my situation here rather than immediately look elsewhere. submitted by /u/not-fungible [link] [comments]",

    "title": "CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Surged 20% in 2025",
    "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added 245 vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog in 2025, as the database grew to 1,484 software and hardware flaws at high risk of cyberattacks. The agency removed at least one vulnerability from the catalog in 2025 – CVE-2025-6264, a Velociraptor Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability that CISA determined had insufficient evidence of exploitation – but the database has generally grown steadily since its launch in November 2021. After an initial surge of added vulnerabilities after the database first launched, growth stabilized in 2023 and 2024, with 187 vulnerabilities added in 2023 and 185 in 2024 . Growth accelerated in 2025, however, as CISA added 245 vulnerabilities to the KEV catalog , an increase of more than 30% above the trend seen in 2023 and 2024. With new vulnerabilities surging in recent weeks, the elevated exploitation trend may well continue into 2026. Overall, CISA KEV vulnerabilities grew from 1,239 vulnerabilities at the end of 2024 to 1,484 at the end of 2025, an increase of just under 20%. We’ll look at some of the trends and vulnerabilities from 2025 – including 24 vulnerabilities known to be exploited by ransomware groups – along with the vendors and projects that had the most CVEs added to the list this year. Older Vulnerabilities Added to CISA KEV Also Grew The addition of older vulnerabilities to the CISA KEV catalog also grew in 2025. In 2023 and 2024, 60 to 70 older vulnerabilities were added to the KEV catalog each year. In 2025, the number of vulnerabilities from 2024 and earlier added to the catalog grew to 94, a 34% increase from a year earlier. The oldest vulnerability added to the KEV catalog in 2025 was CVE-2007-0671, a Microsoft Office Excel Remote Code Execution vulnerability. The oldest vulnerability in the catalog remains one from 2002 – CVE-2002-0367, a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows NT and Windows 2000 smss.exe debugging subsystem that has been known to be used in ransomware attacks. Vulnerabilities Used in Ransomware Attacks CISA marked 24 of the vulnerabilities added in 2025 as known to be exploited by ransomware groups. They include some well-known flaws such as CVE-2025-5777 (dubbed “CitrixBleed 2”) and Oracle E-Business Suite vulnerabilities exploited by the CL0P ransomware group. The full list of vulnerabilities newly exploited by ransomware groups in 2025 is included below, and should be prioritized by security teams if they’re not yet patched. Vulnerabilities Exploited by Ransomware Groups CVE-2025-5777 Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway Out-of-Bounds Read CVE-2025-31161 CrushFTP Authentication Bypass CVE-2019-6693 Fortinet FortiOS Use of Hard-Coded Credentials CVE-2025-24472 Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Authentication Bypass CVE-2024-55591 Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Authentication Bypass CVE-2025-10035 Fortra GoAnywhere MFT Deserialization of Untrusted Data CVE-2025-22457 Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways Stack-Based Buffer Overflow CVE-2025-0282 Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways Stack-Based Buffer Overflow CVE-2025-55182 Meta React Server Components Remote Code Execution CVE-2025-49704 Microsoft SharePoint Code Injection CVE-2025-49706 Microsoft SharePoint Improper Authentication CVE-2025-53770 Microsoft SharePoint Deserialization of Untrusted Data CVE-2025-29824 Microsoft Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver Use-After-Free CVE-2025-26633 Microsoft Windows Management Console (MMC) Improper Neutralization CVE-2018-8639 Microsoft Windows Win32k Improper Resource Shutdown or Release CVE-2024-55550 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal CVE-2024-41713 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal CVE-2025-61884 Oracle E-Business Suite Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) CVE-2025-61882 Oracle E-Business Suite Unspecified CVE-2023-48365 Qlik Sense HTTP Tunneling CVE-2025-31324 SAP NetWeaver Unrestricted File Upload CVE-2024-57727 SimpleHelp Path Traversal CVE-2024-53704 SonicWall SonicOS SSLVPN Improper Authentication CVE-2025-23006 SonicWall SMA1000 Appliances Deserialization Projects and Vendors with the Highest Number of Exploited Vulnerabilities Microsoft once again led all vendors and projects in CISA KEV additions, with 39 vulnerabilities added to the database in 2025, up from 36 in 2024. Several vendors and projects had fewer vulnerabilities added in 2025 than they did in 2024, suggesting improved security controls. Among the vendors and projects that saw a decline in KEV vulnerabilities in 2025 were Adobe, Android, Apache, Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware. 11 vendors and projects had five or more KEV vulnerabilities added this year, included below. Vendor/project CISA KEV additions in 2025 Microsoft 39 Apple 9 Cisco 8 Fortinet 8 Google Chromium 7 Ivanti 7 Linux Kernel 7 Citrix 5 D-Link 5 Oracle 5 SonicWall 5 Most Common Software Weaknesses Exploited in 2025 Eight software and hardware weaknesses (common weakness enumerations, or CWEs) were particularly prominent among the 2025 KEV additions. The list is similar to last year , although CWE-787, CWE-79, and CWE-94 are new to the list this year. CWE-78 – Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’) – was again the most common weakness among vulnerabilities added to the KEV database, accounting for 18 of the 245 vulnerabilities added in 2025. CWE-502 – Deserialization of Untrusted Data – again came in second, occurring in 14 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-22 – Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory, or ‘Path Traversal’ – moved up to third place with 13 appearances. CWE-416 – Use After Free – slipped a spot to fourth and was behind 11 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-787 – Out-of-bounds Write – was a factor in 10 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-79 – Cross-site Scripting – appeared 7 times. CWE-94 (Code Injection) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) occurred 6 times each. Conclusion CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog remains a valuable tool for helping IT security teams prioritize patching and vulnerability management efforts. The CISA KEV catalog can also alert organizations to third-party risks – although by the time a vulnerability gets added to the database, it’s become an urgent problem requiring immediate attention. Third-party risk management (TPRM) solutions could provide earlier warnings about partner risk through audits and other tools. Finally, software and application development teams should monitor CISA KEV additions to gain awareness of common software weaknesses that threat actors routinely target.

    "summary": "Hi everyone, I’m posting here to seek guidance because I’m completely stuck between the police station and the cyber cell. I lost my mobile phone and immediately did everything by the book: Filed a complain Police Station, Jamshedpur Blocked the phone using CEIR (DoT portal) A few days later, I received an official SMS from the Department of Telecom stating that my blocked IMEI was attempted to be used , and that the information was shared with the same police station where my FIR was registered. After receiving this alert, I went multiple times to police stationHowever: The police told me they need location details from Cyber Cell They called Cyber Cell in front of me and then said “we can’t help” Police said only Cyber Cell can recover the phone I then personally contacted the Cyber Cell , and they told me something very important: Every police station is already provided CEIR login ID/password Police can directly check IMEI status and usage on CEIR Cyber Cell does not recover phones physically Cyber Cell also cannot share IMEI location directly with citizens Despite this, when I went back to the police station and told them what Cyber Cell said, the officers replied that no one in their station knows how to use CEIR , and again refused to proceed. So currently: CEIR says phone was active Cyber Cell says police already have access Police station says they can’t help and are waiting for Cyber Cell I feel like responsibility is being passed around, and my case is going nowhere even after official DoT confirmation. My questions: Is it normal for police stations to not use CEIR despite having access? What is the correct escalation route in such cases (SSP/DSP/online grievance)? Has anyone here successfully recovered a phone after a CEIR “attempted usage” alert? Any advice from lawyers, police officers, or people with similar experiences would be really helpful.

Unlike many modern ransomware groups, HardBit does not rely on data leak sites. Instead, it focuses on aggressive system control, credential theft, and destructive encryption. The latest version uses the Neshta file infector as a dropper, applies strong obfuscation, and requires operator-provided authorization keys to execute, significantly complicating analysis. Key Traits • uses the Neshta file infector as a ransomware dropper • deploys both CLI and GUI variants for operator flexibility • requires a runtime authorization ID and encryption key to execute • includes an optional Wiper mode for permanent data destruction • spreads laterally through RDP using harvested credentials • executes Mimikatz via batch scripts to dump credentials • scans networks using KPortScan and Advanced Port Scanner • disables Windows Defender through registry and PowerShell changes • deletes shadow copies and recovery options to prevent restoration • stops backup and security services before encryption HardBit 4.0 stands out for its use of legacy file infection techniques combined with modern ransomware controls and optional data wiping. Its authorization based execution and destructive mode make it especially dangerous in hands on keyboard intrusions.

    "title": "Cybersecurity skills matter more than headcount in the AI era",
    "summary": "Cybersecurity teams are navigating a shift as skills shortages overtake headcount as the primary concern, according to ISC2’s 2025 Cybersecurity Workforce Study . The research, based on responses from some 16,029 cybersecurity professionals globally, reveals that while budget cuts and layoffs have leveled off after last year’s surge, the pressure on security teams has intensified. ISC2, a nonprofit member organization for cybersecurity professionals , found that cybersecurity workforce budget limitations remain a key driver of staff shortages, with 33% of respondents stating that their organizations do not have enough resources to “adequately” staff their teams. Another 29% of respondents said they cannot afford to hire staff with the skills they need to “adequately secure their organizations,” this year’s study found. And nearly three-fourths (72%) of respondents said that they believe reducing security personnel “significantly increases the risk of a breach in their organizations,” according to ISC2. Economic conditions affecting cybersecurity budgets showed signs of stabilizing in 2025, according to ISC2, with reports of budget cuts dropping to 36% (down one percentage point from 2024) and layoffs declining to 24% (also down one point). Still, underlying workforce challenges remain. “Based on what we’re seeing in the data and the sentiment of cybersecurity professionals globally, there is no indication that budget cuts or layoffs will accelerate significantly in 2026,” says Casey Marks, Chief Operating Officer at ISC2. “Economic conditions will always play an important role in workforce development and enablement. However, the overall outlook does not suggest a worsening trend in 2026.” Skills gaps drive security consequences The study highlights a critical trend: Nearly 90% of respondents (88%) have experienced at least one significant cybersecurity event in their organizations due to skills shortages, with 69% reporting more than one event. The severity of skills needs has grown substantially, with 95% of respondents reporting at least one skill need (up 5% from 2024) and 59% citing critical or significant skills gaps (a 15% increase from the previous year). “A shift is happening. This year’s data makes it clear that the most pressing concern for cybersecurity teams isn’t headcount but skills,” said Debra Taylor, ISC2 Acting CEO and CFO, in a statement . “Skills deficits raise cybersecurity risk levels and challenge business resilience.” Organizations have experienced oversights in cybersecurity processes and procedures (26%), been forced to put underqualified or inexperienced people into roles to cover them (25%), are lacking the time or resources to train cybersecurity staff (25%), and are dealing with misconfigured systems (24%), according to this year’s study. The report also states “Another commonly cited (24%) outcome of skills shortages is that parts of the organization are left under-secured and staff are unable to take advantage of emerging cybersecurity technologies (24% each),” the report states. While the study doesn’t tie security consequences to specific technical domains, the number of consequences shows how capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount, Marks says. “AI and cloud security continue to stand out as the most urgent skills needs from both hiring managers and cybersecurity professionals. Nearly everyone in the study reports at least one skills need, and most report significant ones,” Marks says. “That tells us capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount.” AI adoption accelerates The research found that AI adoption is accelerating quickly, with 28% of respondents reporting that they have already integrated AI tools into their operations and 69% involved in some level of adoption, through integration, active testing, or early evaluation. “What stands out is how fast AI has moved from experimentation into day-to-day operations. More than two-thirds of respondents are already using, testing, or actively evaluating AI tools in their security programs,” Marks explains. “For those who are using them today, the majority are already seeing measurable productivity gains. That tells us that AI is quickly becoming a practice part of how security work gets done, not a future concept.” The study shows that cybersecurity professionals view AI technology as a career accelerator. The study found that 73% believe AI will create more specialized cybersecurity skills, 72% say it will necessitate more strategic cybersecurity mindsets, and 66% said they believe it will require broader skillsets across the workforce. AI remains one of the top skills needed for the second consecutive year, with 41% of respondents of the 2025 study citing it as a critical skill, followed by cloud security at 36%. According to the report, 48% of respondents are already working to gain generalized AI knowledge and skills, while “35% are educating themselves on AI solutions at risk to better understand vulnerabilities and exploits.” “The use of AI tools and the perception that AI will be a career-booster in the cybersecurity industry are prompting professionals to take proactive steps to develop and expand their knowledge and skill base to future-proof their careers,” Marks says. “They see it as a driver of new and more specialized skills, more strategic responsibilities, and broader career pathways.” High cybersecurity job satisfaction The research found that 87% believe there will always be a need for cybersecurity professionals , 81% are confident the profession will remain strong, and 68% are satisfied in their current job (up two percentage points from 2024). Another 80% report feeling passionate about their work. “While satisfaction with organizations and leadership varies, confidence in the profession itself remains high, and that sense of purpose is a powerful stabilizing force. Cybersecurity is a mission-driven field, and 80% reported feeling passionate about their work, while 71% are satisfied with their day-to-day experience. A large majority believe the profession will remain essential in the long term and will continue to feel passionate about their role,” Marks says. Almost half (48%) of respondents feel exhausted from trying to stay current on the latest cybersecurity threats and emerging technologies, and 47% feel overwhelmed by workload, according to the study. ISC2’s findings suggest that sustained investment in skills development—especially related to AI —realistic workload expectations, and support for continuous learning during working hours are essential. The study also found that career development is important to cybersecurity professionals. Nearly one-third (31%) of respondents said they consider advancement opportunities critical, and 23% cited unplanned financial or benefit rewards as key drivers. According to the 2025 study, 75% are likely to stay at their current organization for the next year, but that number drops to 66% when considering the next two years. The study’s findings proves that organizations must rethink their approach to cybersecurity workforce development , according to ISC2’s Marks. “The data shows tremendous energy at the individual level around AI upskilling. Nearly half of respondents are already building AI skills on their own, and many plan to pursue AI-focused qualifications,” Marks says. “Organizations are investing in development through training budgets, internal education and cross-training, but the scale of demand for AI skills is significant. Our research shows widespread individual and organizational investment in AI upskilling, with demand continuing to grow.”",

People who took it in the last few months or so: Have questions changed from short, tool-specific ones (like ports or commands) to more scenario-based? I hear many are now longer paragraphs with situations, tougher to analyze. For preparation: What resources help most with these scenario questions? Official materials, practice exams like Boson or Skillcertpro, or would something more practical like TryHackMe rooms or some other resource be useful? Opinions on the cert: In 2026, does CEH still add value for entry-level or mid-level cybersecurity jobs, especially in ethical hacking? Or should I look at alternatives like OSCP or PenTest+?

    "summary": "I’ve been working in OT security for over 10 years and currently hold the GICSP. I’m looking to add another certification to help move my career forward. Most of the roles I’m applying for clearly match my experience, but I keep running into the same issue: I’m not seen as a strong candidate because I don’t have enough certifications. Unfortunately, my employer isn’t funding any training, so I’m paying for this myself and want to choose wisely. I’m looking for a certification that can help me land a new role relatively quickly and strengthen my profile. Would you recommend something aligned with IEC 62443, or another SANS certification? I do plan to pursue CISSP later, but right now I’m looking for something faster and more practical that can help position me as a top candidate.

PeopleImages.com – Shutterstock.com Generative KI (GenAI) ist zu einem allgegenwärtigen Werkzeug in Unternehmen geworden. Laut einer Umfrage der Boston Consulting Group nutzen 50 Prozent der Unternehmen die Technologie, um Arbeitsabläufe neu zu gestalten. 77 Prozent der Befragten sind überzeugt, dass KI-Agenten in den nächsten drei bis fünf Jahren eine zentrale Rolle für ihre Unternehmensfunktionen spielen werden. CISOs und ihre Sicherheitsteams sind mit der Leistungsfähigkeit künstlicher Intelligenz bestens vertraut und von den Fortschritten der KI ebenso betroffen wie alle anderen Funktionen im Unternehmen. Während Machine Learning seit Jahren ein wichtiger Bestandteil von Cyber-Operationen ist, führt der jüngste Fortschritt der KI – insbesondere im Bereich der generativen KI – dazu, dass sich die Technologie immer tiefer in die Sicherheitsprozesse vordringt. Diese Tools, teils selbst entwickelt, teils von Anbietern bereitgestellt, unterstützen unter anderem bei der Forensik, Incident Response, Log-Analyse, Orchestrierung, Schwachstellenmanagement und der Erstellung von Berichten. Der zunehmende Einsatz von KI in Sicherheitsprozessen verändert CyberOps grundlegend. Er steigert die Wirksamkeit und Produktivität von Sicherheitsexperten und verändert nachhaltig, wie Cybersicherheitsarbeit geleistet wird. „Es ist nicht das Was von CyberOps, das KI verändert, sondern das Wie . Sie verändert die Geschwindigkeit, mit der wir bestimmte Vorgänge erledigen können, und ermöglicht es Menschen, sich auf anspruchsvollere Tätigkeiten zu konzentrieren“, erklärt Matt Gorham , Leiter des Cyber & Risk Innovation Institute bei PwC. Kompetenzen erweitern, Aufgaben automatisieren „Da KI Aufgaben mit einer Geschwindigkeit ausführen kann, die menschliche Fähigkeiten übersteigt, skaliert sie das Arbeitsvolumen einer Cybersicherheitsfunktion exponentiell“, betont Rob T. Lee , Chief of Research für KI und neue Bedrohungen sowie Leiter der Fakultät am SANS Institute. Darüber hinaus sei KI besonders gut darin, repetitive Aufgaben jedes Mal nahezu perfekt auszuführen, heben Experten hervor. Damit liefere sie eine Konsistenz, die menschlichen Mitarbeitern kaum erreichen können. „Wenn jemand aus irgendeinem Grund nicht in Bestform ist, können die Ergebnisse variieren“, erklärt Dan Mellen , globaler Cyber-CTO bei EY. KI hingegen verfolgt einen deterministischen Ansatz und erledigt dieselbe Aufgabe immer auf die gleiche Weise.“ Dadurch sei die Konsistenz der Ergebnisse deutlich höher und vorhersehbarer ist als bei Menschen, so Mellen. KI könne jedoch nicht nur die Geschwindigkeit und die Skalierbarkeit des Sicherheitsteams steigern, sondern auch das Kompetenzniveau erhöhen, argumentiert Jeffrey Brown , Dozent bei IANS Research, Cybersicherheitsberater für Finanzdienstleistungen bei Microsoft und ehemaliger CISO des Bundesstaates Connecticut. „KI ist ein Kraftmultiplikator für die Verteidigung, und zwar gleich in zweierlei Hinsicht“, erklärt Brown: „Die Technologie hebt das Wissensniveau von Junior-Mitarbeiter deutlich an und hilft ihnen, sich schneller einzuarbeiten. Gleichzeitig macht sie erfahrene Mitarbeiter effektiver und definiert Produktivität auf höherem Niveau neu.“ Als Beispiel verweist der Cybersecurity-Experte auf den Einsatz von KI in einem Security Operations Center (SOC). Dort könne KI einen erheblichen Teil – und in einigen Fällen sogar alle – Level-1-Support-Aufgaben übernehmen, etwa Ticket-Triage und -Routing. Damit würden SOC-Mitarbeiter entlastet und könnten sich um komplexere Level-2- oder-3-Probleme kümmern. Generative KI könne den SOC-Mitarbeitern zudem automatisierte Fallstudien und Handlungsempfehlungen für anspruchsvollere Aufgaben liefern und so Effizienz und Produktivität steigern. Trotz der Befürchtungen, dass durch KI Arbeitsplätze verloren gehen könnten, hat Brown bisher beobachtet, dass CISOs KI nicht zum Ersatz von Mitarbeitern, sondern zur Verbesserung ihrer Arbeit einsetzen. „KI ist am effektivsten, wenn weiterhin ein Mensch im Loop bleibt“, erklärt er. Auf diese Weise erweitere KI den Handlungsspielraum von CISO-Teams und befähige mehr Teammitglieder, anspruchsvollere Aufgaben zu übernehmen. So habe etwa der Einsatz von KI im Threat Modelling es Unternehmen mit kleineren, weniger spezialisierten Teams ermöglicht, potenzielle Sicherheitsbedrohungen proaktiv zu identifizieren, zu analysieren und zu entschärfen – Aufgaben, die sie vor der Einführung von KI nicht bewältigen konnten. „Im Allgemeinen beobachten wir, dass SecOps-Teams mit den vorhandenen Ressourcen mehr leisten und das Qualifikationsniveau insgesamt steigt. Ihre Arbeit verschiebt sich spürbar nach oben“, erklärt Wolfgang Goerlich , Dozent bei IANS Research und CISO im öffentlichen Sektor. Kleinere Teams, neues Qualifikationsparadigma All dies wirkt ich auch auf die Personalstrategie aus. Sicherheitsexperten gehen davon aus, dass traditionelle Einstiegspositionen im IT-Security-Bereich bald verschwinden werden. Berufseinsteiger müssten bereit sein, auf einer höheren Ebene einzusteigen. Dies gelte insbesondere, da agentenbasierte KI immer ausgereifter werde, in immer mehr Sicherheitsabteilungen zum Einsatz komme und einen zunehmend größeren Teil der Aufgaben übernehme, so Brown. „Wir müssen uns überlegen, wie viele und welche Arten von Experten wir benötigen“, fügt er hinzu. Als Brown CISO für den Bundesstaat Connecticut war, hatte er beispielsweise einen Mitarbeiter in seinem Sicherheitsteam, der sich auf Phishing konzentrierte. Heute stellt er in Frage, ob es eine solche Spezialisierung noch braucht, wenn Agentic AI automatisch große Teile oder sogar den gesamten Workflow zur Reaktion auf Phishing-Angriffe übernehmen kann. Mit KI werden Cybersicherheitsteams nach Einschätzung von Brown mit KI kleiner – und bestehen aus weniger klassischer Spezialisten. „Stattdessen werden sie zu Managern von Agenten, die ihnen bei der Arbeit helfen“, sagt er. Brown räumt jedoch ein, dass der Einsatz von KI in CyberOps neue Kompetenzen erfordern wird – und dass CISOs gezielt nach diesen Fähigkeiten suchen müssen. Kenntnisse in KI-Governance, Prompt Engineering und Data Science werden seiner Ansicht nach auf allen Ebenen der IT-Sicherheit unverzichtbar. „Das ist ein gewaltiger Paradigmenwechsel“, erklärt er. „Wir brauchen Menschen, die sich mit Agenten auskennen, und erkennen können, ob dieser die richtige Antwort gibt – oder nicht.“ „Menschliche Intuition ist unersetzlich“, so Brown abschließend. „Es wird eher eine Symbiose zwischen Mensch und KI sein, eine Partnerschaft, bei der KI die Produktivität steigert, aber immer mit einem Menschen im Loop.“ Der Bedarf an Governance, Agilität und Geschwindigkeit Die beschleunigte Nutzung von KI im gesamten Unternehmen verändert auch die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen. Die Cybersicherheit muss mit der Absicherung von KI und den von ihr verwendeten Daten überall dort Schritt halten, wo KI eingesetzt wird. Damit tun sich Security-Teams bereits heute schwer. Laut dem Bericht „ State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2025 “ von Accenture „hinken besorgniserregende 77 Prozent der Unternehmen bei der Einführung wesentlicher Sicherheitsmaßnahmen für Daten und KI hinterher. Nur 22 Prozent haben klare Richtlinien und Schulungen für den Einsatz von GenAI implementiert, und nur wenige führen ein vollständiges Inventar ihrer KI-Systeme – eine wichtige Voraussetzung, um das Risiko in der Lieferkette zu managen. Darüber hinaus ist der Datenschutz nach wie vor unzureichend – nur 25 Prozent der Unternehmen nutzen Verschlüsselung und Zugriffskontrollen konsequent, um sensible Informationen während der Übertragung, im Ruhezustand und bei der Verarbeitung zu schützen.“ Zudem stellt der Bericht fest, dass sich die Sicherheitslücken auch auf die Cloud-Infrastruktur erstrecken. Denn, so Accenture: „Trotz der Abhängigkeit der KI von Cloud-basierter Verarbeitung haben 83 Prozent der Unternehmen keine sichere Cloud-Basis mit integrierten Überwachungs-, Erkennungs- und Reaktionsfunktionen geschaffen.“ In ähnlicher Weise schreibt Gartner in seinem Bericht „ A CISO’s Guide to AI Cyber Stewardship “ vom Juli 2025, dass „CISOs bei der Sicherung der KI im gesamten Unternehmen hinterherhinken“. Um KI-bezogene Cyberrisiken zu managen, rät der Report CISOs, „einen Ansatz für die KI-Cyber-Stewardship zu verfolgen, der auf Kompetenz, Governance über den gesamten Lebenszyklus, interdisziplinären Schnittstellen, menschlicher Aufsicht, Basiskontrollen und AI TRiSM [Trust, Risk and Security Management] basiert.“ Sicherheitsverantwortliche sind sich einig, dass CyberOps seine KI-Governance-Funktion ausbauen muss – ebenso wie die Fähigkeit, KI-Agenten zu integrieren, zu identifizieren und zu autorisieren. „Es muss Kontrollmechanismen geben, um sicherzustellen, dass KI-Agenten nicht ihre Befugnisse überschreiten, genauso wie wir es bei Menschen handhaben“, erklärt Mellen. Zugleich muss die IT-Sicherheit schneller werden, wenn es darum geht, KI im Unternehmen abzusichern. „Das Tempo des geschäftlichen Wandels wird weiter steigen, und der CISO muss Schritt halten“, konstatiert Gorham. „Die dafür erforderlichen Fähigkeiten werden sich verändern; Cybersecurity-Teams brauchen neben den traditionellen Sicherheitskompetenzen eine Kombination aus KI-Fähigkeiten wie Prompt Engineering und Data-Science-Know-how.“ Cyber-Teams neu denken Avivah Litan , Distinguished VP Analyst bei Gartner, geht davon aus, dass KI mindestens ebenso viele Arbeitsplätze schaffen wird, wie sie ersetzt. Wie viele andere glaubt sie, dass KI „Menschen dazu befähigen wird, mehr und bessere Arbeit zu leisten“. Diese neuen CyberOps-Rollen werden ihrer Einschätzung nach notwendig sein, da Hacker KI nutzen, um immer raffiniertere Angriffe zu starten. „KI wird es Unternehmen ermöglichen, dem wirksamer zu begegnen“, fügt sie hinzu. All dies erfordert jedoch, dass CISOs ihre Security-Organisationen überdenken, um sicherzustellen, dass sie sowohl KI als auch Menschen optimal einsetzen. „Sie müssen sich fragen: ‚Wo ist es sinnvoll, einen Menschen einzusetzen, und was kann ich an die KI auslagern? Und welche Kosten entstehen dadurch, weil mir bestimmte Ressourcen im Team fehlen?‘“, erklärt CISO Goerlich. „Wir sind im Security-Bereich seit langem unterbesetzt, und darin liegt eine große Chance. Andererseits möchte niemand ein SOC-Team, das nur noch auf Knöpfe klickt.“ Goerlich zufolge müssen CISOs ihre Talentstrategien aktualisieren und Roadmaps entwickeln – um bestehender Mitarbeiter weiterzuentwickeln und neue Mitarbeiter für die Positionen der Zukunft einzustellen, in denen sie Seite an Seite mit KI und KI-Agenten arbeiten werden. Dabei darf jedoch die menschliche Intelligenz in den Sicherheitsprozessen nicht verloren gehen. Dies ist besonders wichtig, da – wie CISOs wissen – auch die Angreifer KI einsetzen. Und sie tun dies oft schneller, da sie anders als die Unternehmen nicht an ethische Vorgaben und rechtliche Vorschriften gebunden sind. Goerlich bemerkt dazu: „Die Zukunft der Security Operations wird ein Wettstreit zwischen KI und KI sein. Maschine gegen Maschine – mit Menschen im Cockpit, die auf der Verteidigerseite sicherstellen, dass die richtigen Dinge geschehen – oder auf der Seite der Angreifer dafür sorgen, dass die Attacken erfolgreich sind. Das wird uns zwingen, unsere Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu überdenken.“ (mb)",

This year was particularly challenging for many reasons and one of the primary ones was the continuing saga of our antique house. For all the people who haven’t purchased a house yet but want to, you might want to read this first. This image was generated by Nano Banana. It got a decent Savannah porch in there but the roof doesn’t look exactly right and the paint looks fuzzy instead of like it’s peeling. You can usually still tell images are generated by AI if you look closely. Most of the marketing photos I see on cloud sites definitely look AI-generated. Still, probably close enough to give you an idea what I’m going to write about. :) This is going to be a pretty long brain dump because there are different considerations for different types of houses. In addition, all of this has been…a lot…Just kind of getting it all out there so anyone else buying a home or trying to fix one can learn from my mistakes and experiences. This also explains what my focus will be, in part, in 2026 and how that intersects with my technical research and goals. The lakeside condo I’m on my third house. The first one was a condo actually. I like this particular part of town in Seattle after I got out of school from the University of Washington in Seattle. I had rented a place in Wedgewood with my last college roommates (I had a wide variety over the years) up on a hill in a nice neighborhood north of school. That was an ok place to live but I found myself drawn to Magnuson Park on Lake Washington most of the time. I always want to live by water. I explored the places I could live right near that park and ran across these condominiums called “The Sand Piper.” I liked them the best of the ones I saw in that area. I noticed that there were advertisements on the window of the manager’s office where people were renting the condos out but I couldn’t afford them. I figured well if they can put up notices that they were renting maybe I could put up a little sign saying I wanted to rent one and how much I could pay. The manager was a nice old guy and said OK. Almost immediately after putting up my little sign I got a call. There was a man who had moved out of his condo to take care of his sick mother. We worked out an agreement and I rented his place. I lived there for a few years and then at some point, I contacted him and asked him if I could buy it. Amazingly he said OK and I bought it without a realtor for a pretty low price. I had a $450 per month payment and the stupidest thing I ever did was sell that condo. I needed the money to keep running my business. Never. Do. That. I thought I was going to move and rent temporarily and do the same thing to buy the next place. But it never worked out. The dot bomb crash hit and one thing after another went wrong and I ended up bouncing around for a bit. Transient home hopping I went to San Diego for a while to play beach volleyball, Australia (Manly Beach), Chicago for a couple of weeks to help a family member, stayed with my parents for a bit since I hadn’t seen them in a while, and then back to Seattle where I stayed with a friend for a couple of weeks and then found an apartment — on the water next to Alki Beach. I stayed in that apartment for a while and I love it. It was a building built in 1937 with historic windows and doors and features. It has the hugest big window. You just can’t find those things everywhere. I thought I’d probably never move. I thought that I should buy a house and have some equity but I loved my little apartment, the location, and everything about it. Alki Beach Bungalow But then my ex-business partner became a real estate agent and he asked me if I wanted to look at houses. I wanted to help him out so I said OK I’ll look — but don’t expect me to buy anything. I didn’t want him to get his hopes up. Literally on our first trip out, I walked into this little house with a view of Alki Beach that looked like nothing special in the listing. I walked in, walked up to the 1940’s solid wood window trim and put my hands on either side of looking at the water. “I want it!” The house was cheap by all standards due to the 2008 crash. The owners were elderly folks who had moved out and their kids were selling. The first deal had fallen through and they wanted to unload it. The house was just out of my price range based on the loan for which I was approved. I put in an offer for exactly the amount I had — and they accepted it! I must admit I got so lucky with that house. I think I bought at the very bottom of the market. I had a 2% interest loan. The guy that owned it was a Boeing engineer and he and his wife took care of it very well. It was a solid find with no major structural issues. By the time I left I think I fixed everything that was in my original inspection report. It was a cute 944 square foot (1440 with unfinished basement I loved) with a view and a pool. The house came with a pool. I grew up with a pool. I didn’t want a pool. They are a lot of work. But oh well maybe if I have a pool I will have a lot of people over for pool parties. I had a couple of parties but mostly the pool didn’t get a ton of use while I lived there. It was only really usable three months of the year and it was mostly an expensive hassle. Over the years I had the sewer line inspected and they blew fiberglass in it before I resurfaced the pool. That also fixed it so rats wouldn’t keep trying to get at it due to the leaks. I replaced an oil furnace with a heat pump. I refinished the kitchen, modified a closet to become a custom server and media cabinet closet, and put in a TV that came out of the ceiling in a very oddly configured living room. I redid the fireplace installing a wood-burning insert. I remodeled the kitchen including a custom cabinet. Remodeled the bathroom with a custom designed vanity and tile. Changed all the lights. And painted it many, many times because I loved changing the colors. OK so that house was pretty cool. So why did I move? Well after a while I just wanted to get out of Seattle for various reasons. It’s beautiful in some ways, in others not so much. I was looking around for where to move but in the end I didn’t know where to go so I just decided to stay. Then I started talking to my now husband. Long story short, I’m in Savannah and I love it. A Savannah Victorian Antique When I started looking at houses in Savannah, the only ones I truly liked were the historic houses. I LOVE historic houses. My house in Alki Beach was built in 1940’s which is not that old but for Seattle it’s older. At first I saw the old wood wall and thought — that has got to go. Then I read about the history of the wood walls and realized it wasn’t paneling. It was actually real wood. I left it. In that house I went for a mix of modern and historic but in Savannah I could get a truly antique house (over 100 years old). Those are few and far between in Seattle. In Savannah, there are still many 100+ year old houses. Savannah is a bit strange because you have a real mix of incomes and homes and city buildings all in the same neighborhood and sometimes on the same street or even block. It’s also expanding. The core historic homes go for millions of dollars in downtown Savannah. As you move outwards the homes become more run down in some areas and less historic in others. You can see how over the decades more and more homes were added, expanding the city outward. There are some neighborhoods with super nice homes outside of the historic district in Savannah in a particular area built in the 40’s and 50’s with somewhat questionable history. Well, really a lot of Savannah has such history. We were told that the condo kitty corner to us was a brothel, for instance. And this used to be one of the most dangerous parts of the city apparently. It’s changed over the years as with many neighborhoods — for better or for worse. When I moved here I could see the edge of the truly historic and the renovation moving outwards, north and south and west of the city. I found a location that was just on the edge of the “expensive” homes on the edge of a lot of construction and renovation and bought there. I looked at homes that had been renovated but I purposely found a historic home that had some issues so I could renovate it the way I wanted. The home I purchased has old fashioned wooden floors, brick chimneys, four fireplaces, a trunk room, a hallway that I presume used to be a butler’s pantry, huge pocket doors (I mean really huge), 12 foot ceilings, and truly historic windows (they still have ropes and chains, wavy glass , and historic wood and one huge bay window). The siding looks historic not like cement board and has the appropriate narrow sizing. I can always tell when windows and siding have been replaced with less historic materials. The columns are round, not just square beams added later after the original porch failed. But little did I know, the history and ability to renovate comes with a price. The luck I had with my first two homes did not transfer to this latest purchase. Yes, I read the inspection report. I knew it had some issues just like the other home I purchased. What I didn’t realize was the gravity of those issues and how they might impact the stability of home. Live and learn. I had to buy the house pretty fast because the market was so crazy. I did have an inspection and I did have a contractor come out and estimate the cost of replacing one failing beam. But what I didn’t realize was that one failing beam wasn’t the only or biggest problem. So the rest of this post is just a few tips on things I’ve learned — not only with this house but from all the places I have lived. HOA dues — know what you’re getting yourself into When you buy a home in some places — most condos, townhomes, gated communities and what are called “plantations” here in the south — come with HOA dues. HOA dues are for the homeowners association associated with the location and I’m not going to get into ALL the drama you can face being part of a location that has HOA dues. There are pros and cons to HOA dues. The pros — they take care of a lot of things for you like landscaping and some maintenance external to your property. The cons — you have to pay a monthly fee that may be raised or worse — something big fails on the property and everyone has to chip in to fix it whether you have the money or not and whether you agree with the change or not. You likely have a vote but if your vote is in the minority you may end up having to come up with thousands of dollars to pay for something you may or may not want. I was clueless and got really lucky when I bought my condo at the Sand Piper because the HOA dues were low and they had just fixed the roof. I’ve known people who had to pay for fixing roofs, windows, and even pay for renovations in a shared restaurant and community center on the property that they never use. The inspection report At my first home, I had my dad come and inspect it. He built his own home and is very knowledgeable. I added his approval as a contingency in my real estate agreement. He inspected the house and gave his thumbs up — and he was right. That home was really solid and very well maintained. Most of the things I improved upon at that home were cosmetic. Now let’s talk about my home in Savannah. Yes, I got the inspection report. Yes, I read it. Yes I knew there were issues. But how everything transpired was not aligned with my expectations — exacerbated by the rise of interest rates and hiring some contractors that made it worse by ripping my house apart so I could not refinance as the interest rates skyrocketed. Live and learn. I made a good amount of money when I sold my Seattle home. I actually bought a cheaper home in Savannah so I could use the extra money to fix it up. It’s amazing how fast that money evaporated. That’s what it feels like anyway. Taxes I had to pay more taxes than expected from the sale due to a mistake I made after moving. I should have stayed in Seattle and not changed my mailing address until the deal was complete. I had a Georgia address while transitioning and ended up having to pay Georgia state tax on my home sale even though I hadn’t officially become a Georgia resident yet! Interest rates and bank shenanigans I also didn’t secure a loan due to weird issues with the bank that financed the loan — and approved me and then UN-approved me when I had hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in the bank. To this day I am skeptical. I think someone at that bank may have wanted to buy my house because they saw it was a good deal. I ended up cashing out a bunch of stocks and paying in cash, but along with that came a big tax bill and no loan secured at a cheap interest rate. And about that good deal — I have issues to fix but the value of the house rose like $300K in two years so…am I right? Who knows if the market will hold but Savannah seems to be expanding in a good way, even if it has some problems. I am still happy with my purchase even in light of some of the issues I’m about to tell you about. Ok so now about that inspection report… Electric bills My house in Savannah is four times bigger than my house in Seattle. Holy electric bills. Savannah has some times where the weather is mild and we turn off the air conditioner and heating system, but in those summer months…phew. And there are about two months in the winter where it gets very cold, rainy and we had some unusually code freezes. Beyond that I learned that the back half of the house is missing a lot of insulation …and eventually I realized that the back of the house was literally peeling off the rest of the house due ot a failing foundation and maybe pressure from above. Hold that thought. We are literally heating and cooling the city of Savannah. I’m talking $600–700 per month in some cases. Insane! I ended up plugging a bunch of things as best I could and we put some stupid looking blankets up on the door to our pantry and laundry room — but there’s literally a gap above both those door frames where they are breaking away from the house and the air is seeping in. I don’t think that was in our inspection report. HVAC Ducts Our inspection report mentioned some issues with the ducts under the house. Maybe chewed up by animals. Ok. More on that later. What I learned was that those ducts may be contributing to the expense of heating and cooling the house. So of course I got those fixed almost right away. While I was at it I had them install a sump pump kind of thing to deal with water under the house. They told me there was some strange pipe going all the way from one side of the house to the other. There was no apparent reason at the time as I hadn’t lived in the house long enough to know why. It would be cheaper just to have the water leak out ot the closer side. Ok sure. But then I saw that the water was just draining out on the side of the house and not going anywhere. The HVAC guy shrugged. Not his thing. So what’s the point of a sump pump that drains to nowhere? That makes no sense. I had some challenges with the whole drainage problem so let’s talk about that. Water So much water. The first two times I came to Savannah it was sunny and nice — May and November. Then I came in December and I told my husband that I thought he had pulled one over on me. Rain in Georgia doesn’t play. When it rains, the sky opens up and the clouds dump over barrels of rain all at once. The thunder is earth shattering. The inspection report said there was some standing water under our house. Yeah yeah ok. No really, there ended up being a river flowing between our house and the neighbor’s house. Not only that the sewer line in front of our house had issues. I joked that when it rains we had lake front property. Hold that thought. Pondering the foundation OK so there’s some issues with the bricks in the pilings holding the house up in the inspection report. Ok sure. I know the floors aren’t level and seems like that all needs to be fixed at once. That’s logical right? I called Ram Jack and another similar company for a quote and they were either $17K or $45K. I had no idea it was going to be so much after the things I had fixed in Seattle. Then a structural engineer told me I probably didn’t need that. I could just put car jacks down there yada yada. The floors can be leveled from inside the house. Ok. (But how do you maintain the antique floor…? More on that in a minute.) The gist of it was that Ram Jack, that company that is always on TV might be overkill. I held off at that moment to explore other options. I hired a different structural engineer ( Brian Sapp ) because the first one disappeared and he gave me a second opinion on everything. He gave me some temporary fixes until we would were ready to do the big project. Would they last? Who knows. Only time would tell. I went seeking for someone to help me put in those temp fixes while we waited for interest rates to come down. The guest bathroom I hired a contractor and that’s a whole long story I won’t bore you with completely. I wanted him to finish this temp project and help come up with a plan for the larger project. After waiting for a year for him at the recommendation of some others he took over six months to complete a project that he suggested could be done in 3–4 weeks. One thing I wanted him to do was just replace some moldy walls in a bathroom temporarily because I had guests coming over. Instead his carpenter ripped out the whole bathroom wall! He also said he could not tell what to do with the back room until he ripped the ceiling off so I said go ahead. THEN. I find out that the bank won’t give us a loan while the house is “under construction.” Do you think a contractor should know this when he knows we are trying to refinance to get a loan to do the project? I don’t know. Seems odd. So I ask him if he can quickly put the house back together. I also am pondering if I should just fix the bathroom wall or the whole bathroom. He claims he can probably get the bathroom done in three weeks. Yeah. Six months later interest rates are up over 2% and I ended up hiring my own plumber, my own electrician, and asking him to not bring the drywall people back. I and my nephew finished the drywall (mostly me in the end and I’m not great) just to get it done before we had guests over for my husband’s birthday. I even had to trick my husband into helping me and he hates tools. He was screwing in the plate covering the bathroom fan at the last minute while I scrambled to complete everything else (I didn’t) when the first guests walked through the door. Phew. I ended up doing some things to make that bathroom historic like an antique chandelier I got off eBay, a historic table I got at a local antique shop, a historic looking sink and a poster of a Life magazine cover from 1922. Our house was built in 1920. Now, before I had the contractor fix the bathroom he swore that there would be no reason why we shouldn’t do that. The foundation was solid. They could fix the adjoining rooms from within those rooms, etc. OK sure. We’ll see. It’s probably the nicest room in our house right now. Just give me a plan, ok? I need a plan. After that I gave up on refinancing as I realized I had jumped on a good (not great) rate at just the right time and secured it. Since then, even though the rates have dropped like three times, they are barely lower than that rate if they are at all. Those rates are killing our finances. I spent thousands and thousands of dollars more on interest thanks to our house getting ripped apart and not being able to refinance right at that moment. Also not being able to secure the initial home loan which would have been at 3.5%. Great thanks. That and the cost of everything went up — building materials, groceries, and now with tariffs so much more is costing more than if we had been able to do the project immediately when I wanted to do it. I never should have waited for that original contractor. But I was new to the city and I know it’s a small town where everyone knows each other and I just wasn’t sure what to do. I wanted to be everybody’s friend but that cost us a lot of money. Initially while waiting on that contractor I was hoping he would help us come up with a plan for fixing the house. I contacted multiple architects and it was hard to find one. The first one wanted to project manage the whole project. I couldn’t find examples of his work anywhere and for whatever reason he would not give me a complete price, only a price for the “as-built.” I wasn’t even sure if he could do the entire plan based on what I could find and I didn’t want a project manager scheduling meetings with all these people who bill by the hour. I wasn’t ready to hire all those people. I just wanted drawings that showed what I wanted the house to look like and my plan for fixing some structural issues and THEN I would get the right contractor to implement the plan. Mind you, he was super nice and may have been awesome but I really needed to know a budget so I could ensure I had enough money in the bank to pay him. I have learned from past business problems not to start anything until the money is in the bank. And I didn’t want the project managed the way he was indicating. I didn’t need a project manager — though I’m sure he would be a great one if that’s what you need. My contractor recommended a couple of architects. They set up meetings with me but never gave me a contract or a price! Is everyone really just that busy or what is going on here? I heard that people sometimes just want the high end projects and so they disregard the smaller projects. So what’s the deal? We pay our bills just like anyone else. Give me a quote! Give me a contract! I can’t get any architect to give me a darn contract. Finally I found Josh Ward . He’s amazing. He immediately sent me a contract but said he could not start right away. No problem. I paid a small very reasonable deposit. I wasn’t in a hurry at that point. I was extremely overloaded with work last year. Finally I had a bit of time and we had the money in the bank to pay him and his time freed up we got started. He is amazing, super nice, and his drawings were perfectly what I wanted with just a few tweaks. After completing that plan I was planning to get a contractor to help me implement the solution (using the terminology from the technical world in which I exist.) But then all hell broke loose… The big crack We didn’t quite finish the architectural plan when suddenly I go into my husband’s “man cave” next to the bathroom where I’ve been using the bathtub and I’m like, “Did you want to tell me the crack in the wall had expanded and is now HUGE?!” I’m freaking out. My husband never lived in a house that needed extensive repairs or had been remodeled. Things related to the house don’t phase him that much and most of the home repairs and planning is on me, which I am fine with. But I didn’t realize what was happening in that room because I never go in there. I grew up in remodels. I know a lot of the pitfalls. While my dad was trying to fix a ceiling it fell on his head — and he’s pretty particular and careful about how he does things. (His parents spoke German if you know what I mean.) He ended up building a church and his own house. Along the way he pulled all the trim in a historic house in Yelm, Washington used for a church parsonage, numbered it, fixed the walls, and then put all the trim back exactly as it was before he started. For anyone who says they need to rip out trim, windows, and other historic features, I know the truth. Yes it costs more. Yes it’s a pain. But I know it can be done. And if you’re going to buy an antique, why not restore it and maintain the antique features? Otherwise, what’s the point? Go buy a new house if that’s what you really want. Oh and if you live in the historic district in Savannah you are forced to do that by regulation. I am not in that neighborhood but I still want to maintain the historic qualities of our home. So anyway back to our beloved crack. The back of the house was clearly remodeled. When we ripped off the ceiling and part of the walls in the back room we found newspapers from 2008. The back of the house…is shoddy to say the least. We found out from a neighbor that at some point that part of the house caught on fire which likely is what led to the less than ideal repairs. I’ve always planned to rip a lot of it off and redo it while maintaining any historic features. But we weren’t quite ready to start. Well, now was the time. I frantically told the architect we need to hold off for a minute (well more than a minute) and he agreed. I called the structural engineer again with the idea that I needed a plan that worked with our pretty much complete architecture but apparently we had a miscommunication. He gave me another report. I have never worked with a structural engineer before so apparently I don’t use the correct words or whatever to communicate what I need because I wanted a solution — not another report. But it all worked out in the end and Brian was great. Drainage I wasn’t sure what to do at that point but remember that river flowing beside and under our house? And the HVAC system that we changed to push the water out the other side? Well, I figured that water might be exacerbating the problem under that wall so I searched around trying to find someone to deal with our drainage problem. This is not as easy as it sounds. There are not a lot of companies that just do drainage. Luckily I got a recommendation for Drainage Experts in Savannah through a community group. That was a lucky break. Frank came over and gave me a quote and they put in a super extensive drainage system all around the outside of our house and underneath it. He did a VERY good job as far as I can tell. I also got my neighbor to chip in and fix his gutter pipes that were sending water under our house and exacerbating the problem. They put in a huge pump and now all the water flows out into the sewer instead of heading under our house and into our neighbor’s yard. Luckily it seems the city has fixed the sewer issues in front of our house. Cool. In addition to the drainage another company put in some gutters. They were very cost-effective and quick. Professional Grade Gutters . They helped us out more later with some of the other issues below. So now that the drainage issue is solved, we can continue with the architecture and plan right? Not so fast… More cracks One of the problems in our inspection report was that we have these cement blocks on the roof holding the deck up in the back. And the roof is not exactly the right angle. OK so? Well, those blocks are literally sitting ON THE ROOF. What I learned from Frank is that they should have beams from the deck post all the way down to the ground. Also under that weird new fangled roof is the failing beam — the one thing I thought I had to worry about in the house — that would cost $5–15K to fix according to the contractor. Yeah right. I had already called a roofing company to fix the leak above that beam and our first contractor put up supports under that beam according to what the structural engineer told me to do. Only they did not put the support beams in the right place on top of the piers under the house according to subsequent report from the structural engineer. * Sigh. * So my plan with the architecture is to move the deck to the edge of the house and have the beams go from the deck all the way to the ground and remove those stupid cement blocks. And somehow we’ll find a way to merge those two roofs and replace that beam. And as I’m dealing with the water and trying to come up with a plan — from someone, anyone — the bathroom tile in the upstairs bathroom where a tub sticks out of the side of the house starts cracking very fast all the way up the corner. It literally cracks and wakes me up at night. And another wall in the man cave is cracking floor to ceiling. And a kitchen wall seems like it’s getting crushed. And I swear a crack in the back room got bigger like the back of that room is cracking off. Oh yeah and a brown crack appeared in our kitchen ceiling. And a crack appeared end to end in a historic fireplace mantle which kills me. And there are brown spots in ceilings around chimneys which I’m told is called rust and may be due to leaks around them or water coming in through them. Everyone who has lived here a long time tell me all this happens in old houses and yes you should fix it but no it’s fine. It will just keep cracking. No big deal. You’ll know when it’s really a problem when the ceiling falls down or something like that. So then there’s a windstorm and a balcony falls off a historic mansion next to Forsyth park. NOPE. Not gonna wait for that to happen. Working on this NOW. A plan…anyone please…a plan ACK! So I need a contractor to give me a plan to fix all this but I know the first step is to fix the foundation. After doing a lot of research and through discussion with a relative I know there’s a way to slowly raise the house from underneath by adding jacks and slowly pushing up the house to adjust the floors without breaking things . The problem with the companies that come and jack up your house all at once is that they jack the house up really fast, break a bunch of things, and the floors still won’t be level because the because the historic wood may be permanently bowed. Multiple people told me that the solution is to fix the floors by rebuilding them on top of the existing foundation. Regardless of how you end up fixing the foundation, I don’t see how doing that alone is going to solve all the problems. It doesn’t make sense to me. But that seems like the obvious place to start. I’m wondering if someone can start the process of raising the house in various places to help solve the problems. So I am frantically trying to find a contractor or anyone to help us and I want to do that thing to raise the house and fix the various issues. I talked to many people again including a guy from one of those foundation companies that jacks the house up who tells me he smells mold in the cracking bathroom and I should cut a small hole in the wall. And Frank came over and suggested that maybe the floor wasn’t built well enough to hold up the tub jutting out the side of the house. But we can’t tell that until the tub is pulled out and floor is inspected. And here’s where it gets nerve wracking. What if something has to be fixed that affects the bathroom below — the bathroom I never intended to fix in the first place and which the other contractor assured me would not be affected by other repairs. We’ll see. Leaks, mold, roofs, and chimneys After all this, it seems like the bathroom floor might be the source of our big crack — not the foundation? Or both. I don’t know. But anyway I cut a hole in the bathroom and yes mold and water damage. And this moldy smell all started when we did the drainage project and put in the new gutters. I’ve had many people inspect and tell me there’s no problem with the drainage. The river beside our house is pretty much non-existent. Everyone tells me there’s no water under the house. It might be related to the gutters. I call the gutter company to come back and inspect to try to pinpoint the source of the moldy smell and water damage there and possibly in other parts of the house. And at that point the gutter person sends me a photo and he’s fixing leaks in a roof…OK cool. Now I know he can do more than gutters and they did a really good job last time. We’ll see what he says. I finally get a contractor who agrees to come out and help us come up with a plan — for $5K. I’m ok with that actually. He seemed like he would be really good. I really liked this contractor but he wants to work in a certain way and I’m not sure we can start that right away. But I still want the plan and the budget so I can figure out what to do. How can you decide what to do without knowing the plan and the cost? But before he got back to me I had also started talking to foundation companies and the gutter company that actually can perform other types of services besides gutters. The company name on the new quote comes from Greg Loper of Professional Grade Gutters. And it is NOT as cheap as I expected. But he has like 85 pages of things to fix including something our new contractor said might be very expensive (and still may be) — dealing with the leaky and possibly failing chimneys. They ended up figuring out that there were leaks around the bathroom (there are gables? or something related to a pitched roof over that part of the house that sticks out). In addition, the front porch roof has problems — the wood is rotting and in the end he said it was worse than he thought. I have plans for that roof anyway. We had the flashing and mortar on the chimney fixed, added more gutters, fixed a lot of little leaks all over the roof and holes allowing sideways rain to get into the house. They could have done more with the siding but we have plans to redo that part of the house so that is momentarily on hold. We were also supposed to get caps on the chimneys but he apparently forgot that detail. We paid the invoice anyway because I knew he’d get back to fix it eventually. Missing chimney caps was also on our inspection report, but I didn’t think much of it. But in hindsight, the birds in our chimney every spring were due to the missing chimney caps (something I had mentioned to Greg) and perhaps the rain in the chimney was contributing to the fact that our chimneys seem to be failing and perhaps causing mold and rust on ceilings. I’m not sure. We have a crack in the historic woodwork in one of our upstairs bedrooms which makes me very sad and was told that could be related to a failing chimney. But wait. There’s more! Back to the foundation Besides the typical Ram Jack solutions (they advertise all over on TV here) I found another foundation company that repairs the pilings and wood instead of putting in jacks. They work with a lot of historic houses and had good reviews for the most part. I got quotes from them and the jack company that gave me the $17K quote earlier. What I find odd is that same company came back with a $58K quote this time for the same house. What? The house has not changed that much. The only difference is that now we are working with a structural engineer. In the meantime, it turns out my possible new contractor knows the structural engineer and the architect. Awesome they all work together and they all recommend each other which is promising. But before I signed the paperwork to have him help me come up with a plan, Brian Sapp got back to me about the foundation plans I sent him and says that he can do a design and then the foundation companies will implement the foundation according to the plan and then he will inspect it. YES . That is what I want. A design. A plan. Someone to inspect it to make sure it is done right. That’s exactly what I want. One caveat with Brian Sapp’s design is that he says he can only design the fix for the house the way it is today with no consideration of the architectural plan or what will be in the future. It’s too complicated to do that all at once. For that reason, I hold off on hiring the new contractor until we can get this initial foundation work done. In addition, the contractor says we have to move out and there’s no way we can break up the project in any way shape or form. Hmm. I’m thinking about that. It sounds like monolithic software projects versus micro-services. But anyway, first things first. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We ended up hiring Evolution in Action to come in an repair pilings, piers and beams under the house. They seemed like they had the specific experience we needed for a historic house and a lot of good reviews. We got a quote and it was reasonable for the work that needed to be done. Brian Sapp’s company came up with a design. Once they completed the design we met with him and Henry at Evolution in Action and went over the plan. Then when Evolution in Action was available they got started and finished the project in a very short amount of time, all things considered. Of course there were complications along the way due to a house that is over a century old with many “revisions” along the way. But in the end I feel relieved that part of the project is complete. I can’t see everything under the house but I trust that Brian’s crew inspected it appropriately and besides that Henry’s crew seemed to know what they were doing. What I can see looks very good. The leaning piers under our laundry room are now nice and straight. The floors are still crooked but that was part of the plan. The problem is that if you just start jacking up a house and try to level the floors fast then you might actually crack and break other parts of the house so we just got it stabilized under there for now and will work on fixing all the walls, ceilings and floors next. The good thing is that the tile in the bathroom that was cracking at night and waking me up has stopped. That is a relief. It used to crack and our dog would bark. One night it woke me up at like 3 a.m. right before we did the project with a huge cracking sound. The crack literally started and went all the way up the corner in like a month. Perhaps the foundation was the majority of the issue. There were beams that were literally not resting on anything because the historic mortar had deteriorated and the piers had sunk. I guess we’ll find out but I’m not going to wait that long. Twas the night before Christmas… And all through the house…creatures were stirring. RATS. We keep our house pretty clean. I do the dishes every night due to the cockroaches. I’m not a fan. There were like two days where I lapsed because I was urgently finishing a project but then I got right back on it. I was feeling very guilty about this until someone told me that when they renovate old houses around here the rats scatter and look for a new home. Turns out we had a house across the street where some questionable activities were taking place and the people just got kicked out. I don’t know how or why there was just a realtor lock on the door one day. They just renovated that house including wrapping it in plastic and fumigating it. A guy working over there told me you could literally stick your fingers through the wall. They have been fixing that up for a few months and now it is beautiful. I wonder if that was the source of our problems. I discovered the rats when I opened the drawer where our oven mitts are and — this so gross but I’m sharing anyway — one of the oven mitts was chewed up and there was rat poop in the drawer. My husband does a lot of the cooking (which I love — I’m a lucky gal) and insists he didn’t see it. Anyway I was about to throw up and I threw ALL the mitts away, took everything out of the drawers until I could solve the problem, and proceeded to disinfect those drawers. I also washed all the towels. ACK. We did various things to eradicate the critters. We already have an exterminator and I immediately called them and they immediately had someone come out and reposition the outdoor rat traps which I think made no difference. I started opening the drawer each night, burning a candle in it, and spraying air freshener everywhere on top of scrubbing everything with lemon counter cleaner since I read they don’t like that smell. I got peppermint balls and we have one of those ultrasonic devices which I’m not convinced does much. The peppermint balls didn’t seem to deter our rats either. But in the meantime, about those chimney caps. Our dog had been sniffing around one of the downstairs fireplaces. We had it covered up with a whiteboard when the birds were in the chimney and a tv in front of the fireplace. That was a temporary configuration until we got the chimney cap on there and we want to move a couch that is too big for the room into the back room once that is fixed. I was afraid to even move that whiteboard fearing there might be a rat’s nest behind it. Was the dog smelling rats in our chimney? Well, that question was answered when a rat ran into the living room while we were eating and watching TV. I screamed and my husband claims he never saw it and doesn’t even believe they exist I guess. I immediately called the exterminator again and they came back and put in some sticky traps inside and told me there was nothing behind that white board. Phew. I saw that rat another time and asked for a quote to block all the holes like our exterminator recommended. $7,000. To plug holes. For RATS. That is not what I want to spend $7,000 on right now. Some other people including my mom recommended other types of rat poison and traps and I researched how to plug the holes on the house. There are a lot of complications with that like we plan to tear off and change parts of the house where holes need to be fixed. But that said, I knew some of the primary entry points besides the attic. Chimneys. Under sinks. Any other holes. So I frantically call the gutter company and Greg came out ON CHRISTMAS EVE to help us out. THANK YOU. I knew they would take care of it. I read that rats can go on roofs down chimneys so that solves one problem. We already had the flashing around the chimneys patched up and all the holes in and around the roof for the most part. There are some other holes where they can get into the attic we will deal with later. But my theory is if we can plug the holes inside the house at least they can only get into the attic and under the house — and we have other mitigations for them in those locations. I researched and figured out how we can patch up the chimneys we never use and don’t plan to but before doing that I burned a ton of incense in the problematic fireplace. Supposedly this could be a fire hazard but it’s just smoke not fire and I was watching it. I blocked off the fireplace so the smoke from the incense would mostly go up the chimney. I was reading how people smoke moles out of their holes and such and that gave me the idea to smoke them out. I don’t know if it helped or not but I don’t think they could be in the chimneys while I was doing it. And right after I did that the chimney caps went on. So if the only way they could get into the chimneys was through the roof that is no longer an option. Next I will block the chimneys so they can’t get from inside the chimney into the rooms in case they can get from the attic down the chimneys somehow. I also read about rat trails and it was really clear that the rats were coming up through the holes around the kitchen sink plumbing. I had put a liner in there and blocked the holes to try to block bugs but the rats chewed right through it. I figured out how to block those holes with wire after reading up on exclusion and spent the day before Christmas Eve working on that disgusting project. I threw out the exterminator’s sticky trap with rat droppings all over it. Clearly that wasn’t effective. After researching all this I figured that the rats were coming up through that hole and going behind the cabinets into the drawer with the mitts. Hopefully that is now cut off. I had already blocked the wide open holes in the wall behind the oven with insulation and put great stuff in a lot of the cracks between things in the kitchen but I hadn’t done a good enough job on this hole under the sink — and ultimately now I think that was the primary entry point for both varmints and bugs. What I also learned was that you should use steel wool to plug any holes in your house except those that could be exposed to water. For the holes exposed to water you should use copper wool. I bought all that off Amazon and started plugging any other holes I could find. I also got some stronger rat poison (sorry rat lovers) off Amazon and going to put that around the chimneys in the attic because our exterminator said there was evidence of recent activity up there. Phew. Joy. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. Hopefully 2026 is our year for fun home improvement! So about that structural engineering design… I was trying to design the new architecture to work with the existing pilings with one exception — a small wall that I want to move where the two pilings below it possibly have to move but we’ll see what our engineer says when we get there. That way we will hopefully minimize the changes to fix the structural problems as far as the blocks under the house are concerned. In other words where those deck beams are resting on the roof on cement blocks, pull them to the edge of the house so the posts go from the deck all the way down to the ground on top of existing pilings. Although the structural engineer would not look at the future plans, I did ask for one request. I don’t even know how to read his plans — I didn’t really try because I just trusted those guys all knew what they were talking about and would do the right thing. But I asked him to just make sure all the piers or pilings (blocks) in the back of the house support as much weight as the pilings on the side that already support two stories. I figure (is this logical?) that if the pilings can support two stories then they will be able to support one story and a deck posts. No? So what I am hoping (TBD) is that those piers will support moving the deck posts off the roof to the edge of the house with no additional changes to the bricks, blocks, and cement underneath them. We’ll see. We may still need to make revisions depending on how all the weight gets distributed when we deal with that beam in the back room. These are things I have no clue about and have not bothered to research. I have my own work to do. But we have two weird roofs — an old and new one — on the back of the house and I’m not sure if and how those can be moved or changed and what sort of beams need to go where to support that. I’ve heard talks of ibeams and such and I don’t know how that all works or if we even need those if we change the back ceiling to be supported by the perimeter support. I am planning to keep doors and windows between existing beams and such so hopefully that keeps it simpler but we’ll find out. I’ve got various recommendations and connections and trying to figure out how we will proceed in the new year. All I know is I lived in remodels growing up so I know what that is like. The front half of our house seems to be mostly fine for the moment. We can block off the back part. But then maybe we can’t. Stay tuned if you really want to know. So you say you want a house… When you buy a house it’s not just the cost of the house you’ll need to consider as you’re probably aware. Foundation issues are no joke. Over $25K. Structural engineer — multiple thousands. Architect — over $10K and maybe more than the original estimate when all said and done. Drainage — $12K. Back yard projects, gardening, storage, grill gazebo, outdoor wiring and plumbing issues > $15K. Bathroom project > $10K. Sewer line and plumbing issues $4K? Roof, chimneys, gutters, leaks > $15K. Indoor fans, temporary support beams, drywall, wiring projects, plumbing issues, fix attic stairs, etc. etc. etc. ??? Oh and the biggest projects are not done yet. And in some other parts of the country these prices might be even higher. Even with all those issues, we love our house and I’m just looking forward to the day when it’s all done! Unfortunately this is why I don’t have a lot of bandwidth to work for free and donate time everywhere right now when people ask me for my time. We have a lot of bills to pay. Looks like this will be my focus again in 2026. I’m hoping that some of my research in the AI and security space will pay off and will mostly be going to fix more house issues at the moment. I’m working on tools to improve my coverage on penetration tests. We’ll see how that works out. As always, health, family, and friends come first, but I’m hopeful that we make some progress on all of the above.

    "title": "Was CISOs von Moschusochsen lernen können",
    "summary": "Von Moschusochsen können sich CISOs eine Scheibe abschneiden – wenn es nach unserem Autor geht. Wirestock Creators – shutterstock.com Drittanbieter-Risikomanagement ist für CISOs und Sicherheitsentscheider eine signifikante Herausforderung. Wird sie nicht (richtig) gestemmt, drohen weitreichende geschäftliche Konsequenzen – bis hin zum Stillstand der Produktion. Das wurde in den vergangenen Monaten von diversen Cyberattacken auf Drittanbieter unterstrichen. Zum Beispiel, als die russische Hackergruppe APT29 (auch bekannt als “Cozy Bear”) im Juni 2024 die kostenlose Remote-Access-Software TeamViewer ins Visier nahm , die im Unternehmensumfeld weit verbreitet ist. Selbst, wenn Sie TeamViewer nicht einsetzen – ähnliche Tools gibt es auch von diversen, anderen Anbietern. Beispielsweise von Perimeter81, AnyDesk, GoToMyPC oder LogMeIn. Die entscheidenden Fragen sind dabei: Welcher Drittanbieter wird als nächstes angegriffen? Und können Sie es sich leisten, diesbezüglich ein Risiko einzugehen? Drittanbieter sind Ihr schwächstes Glied Leider verlassen sich so gut wie alle Unternehmen in zu hohem Maße auf zu viele verschiedene Drittanbieter, die in ihre Softwarelieferketten und Geschäftsprozesse eingebettet sind. Dabei reden wir nicht über zwei oder drei Third-Party-Partner, sondern mit Blick auf populäre Software-as-a-Service-Angebote eher über Hunderte oder Tausende, auf die sich Unternehmen jeden Tag verlassen. Das Risiko, das einer Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern inhärent ist, steigt entsprechend drastisch an – und nicht nur, wenn ihre Anzahl überhandnimmt. Weitere Risikofaktoren in diesem Bereich sind beispielsweise: Eingeschränkte Transparenz. So gut wie alle Anbieter bieten potenziellen Kunden diverse Daten an, um ihre Fähigkeiten anzupreisen. Dabei kommen in einigen Fällen allerdings Informationen zum Einsatz, die nicht aktuell sind und somit die aktuelle Risikolage nicht adäquat widerspiegeln. Mehr Komplexität. Diverse Drittanbieter arbeiten selbst mit Zulieferern und Subunternehmen zusammen, von denen Sie möglicherweise nichts wissen. Unausgereifte Prozesse. Nicht wenige Third-Party-Anbieter arbeiten mit Cybersecurity-Richtlinien und -Standards, die weniger ausgereift sind als Ihre eigenen. Geringere Investitionen. Letztgenannter Punkt hängt oft auch damit zusammen, dass viele Drittanbieter ein begrenztes Budget für Cybersicherheit zur Verfügung haben. Das kann sich auf das Sicherheitsniveau ihrer Tools und Services auswirken. Zwar wurde eine Reihe von Best Practices und Playbooks entwickelt, um diese Lücken zu schließen – diese haben sich in weiten Teilen allerdings nicht bewährt: Vendor Assessments verkommen regelmäßig zu papierbasierten “Ankreuzübungen”, die nur Zeit fressen, aber nicht dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren. Auch im Rahmen von Vertragsverhandlungen dafür sorgen zu wollen, dass strengere Sicherheitsanforderungen bei Drittanbietern angelegt werden, hat in vielen Fällen nichts bewirkt. Einige Unternehmen setzen auf Continuous Monitoring, um einen Überblick und mehr, datengetriebene Einblicke in das Sicherheitsniveau von Drittanbietern zu erhalten. Andere implementieren mit Blick auf Third-Party-Partner Incident-Response-Pläne , um Strategien zu entwickeln und einzuüben, falls es bei diesen zu einem Sicherheitsvorfall kommt. Insbesondere die letzten beiden Punkte können für Unternehmen hilfreich sein. Allerdings adressieren auch diese Maßnahmen das Risiko in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbietern nicht vollumfänglich. Vielmehr stellen sie ein Mittel dar, um zu überwachen und zu reagieren, falls es zu einer Cyberattacke kommt . Die Moschusochsen-Strategie Ich bin stolzes Mitglied des “Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center” ( FS-ISAC ) und habe zusammen mit anderen CISOs aus der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche den Vorsitz des strategischen Ausschusses in der Asien-Pazifik-Region inne. Das Konsortium bietet Finanzdienstleistern auf der ganzen Welt ein umfassendes Cyber-Intelligence-Netzwerk, um sich untereinander über möglicherweise bevorstehende oder bereits laufende Angriffskampagnen auszutauschen. Weil viele verschiedene Unternehmen der Branche mit unterschiedlich ausgeprägtem Knowhow und Ressourcen an Bord sind, sind die Mitglieder in der Lage, eine umfassende Perspektive zu erhalten, die sie alleine nicht erreichen könnten. Das FS-ISAC ist insofern ein hervorragendes Beispiel dafür, wie wir als Sicherheitsentscheider zusammenarbeiten können, um uns besser gegen Risiken abzusichern . Das ist die Essenz dessen, was ich als “Moschusochsenstrategie” bezeichne. Der Hintergrund: Werden Moschusochsen von Wölfen angegriffen, bildet die Herde einen Kreis, in dessen Mitte sich die schwächeren Mitglieder befinden. Die Hörner der “Frontline”-Tiere sind dabei nach außen positioniert. Für die Angreifer ist dieser gemeinschaftliche Verteidigungswall kaum noch zu überwinden. Ich bin der festen Überzeugung, dass sich diese Strategie auch auf das Drittanbieter-Risikomanagement übertragen lässt. Ähnlich wie bei den Moschusochsen die Kälber sind die Drittanbieter, auf die wir uns verlassen, die schwächsten Herdenmitglieder. Werden Sie in Mitleidenschaft gezogen, wirkt sich das auf unsere kritischen Geschäftsprozesse aus . Der Unterschied zu den Moschusochsen: Wir bilden keinen Kreis, in dessen Mitte sich die Drittanbieter befinden. Stattdessen wäre es angebracht, sich im Kollektiv darüber auszutauschen, wenn die Sorge besteht, dass die Cybersecurity-Maßnahmen bei einem Third-Party-Anbieter zu wünschen übriglassen und verstärkt werden sollten. Noch wichtiger wäre allerdings eine gemeinsame Übereinkunft darüber, den Drittanbieter bei seinen Bemühungen zu unterstützen. Das würde potenziell Koordinationsarbeit und unter Umständen auch eine Neuverhandlung von Verträgen erfordern – hätte aber den Vorteil, diese Schwachstelle, die uns alle betrifft, besser absichern zu können. Von der Theorie zur Praxis Ein solches Zusammenwirken könnte unter Juristen durchaus Bedenken aufwerfen – Stichwort Wettbewerbsrecht. Dennoch hat der Moschusochsenansatz das Potenzial, die Risikolage in Sachen Drittanbieter entscheidend zu verbessern – und Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen, Third-Party-Risiken besser zu managen. Das könnte – zum Beispiel – folgendermaßen aussehen: Bestimmen Sie, welche Drittanbieter Ihnen am meisten Sorgen bereiten und erstellen Sie eine “Hot List”. Tauschen Sie sich mit anderen Unternehmen aus, um diese Liste abzugleichen und die Kandidaten zu ermitteln, die Sie gemeinsam haben. Verhandeln Sie über einen gemeinschaftlichen “Schutzschild” für diese Anbieter. Denselben Ansatz haben wir bei FS-ISAC als möglichen Weg für die Zukunft diskutiert. Die ersten beiden Schritte sind relativ simpel zu bewerkstelligen – der dritte macht hingegen deutlich mehr Aufwand, aber auch den entscheidenden Unterschied. Ein praktischer Ansatz, um diesen umzusetzen, könnte dabei darin bestehen, dass die größten Unternehmen eine Führungsrolle einnehmen und kleinere unter ihre Fittiche nehmen. Vergessen sollten Sie dabei nicht, dass auch die Moschusochsen-Strategie ihre Grenzen hat: Wenn ein Bär angreift, machen sich auch Moschusochsen aus dem Staub – dann ist jeder auf sich allein gestellt. Das lässt sich ebenfalls auf die Cybersicherheit übertragen: Je mächtiger der Feind, desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass der Angriff in einen Kampf ums blanke Überleben ausartet. Aber auch wenn diese Strategie nicht auf jedes Szenario anwendbar ist, könnte sie unser kollektives Risiko erheblich minimieren.

    "summary": "This started out as a bit of an end-of-the-year grab bag of posts, but I don't like simply linking to things, dropping links with no explanation as to why; instead, I'd rather share the why behind what I found interesting about the post or article. And don't worry...I know after 2025, there are folks out there expecting a flaming bag full of dog poop dropped off on their doorstep, but rest assured...this isn't that. Anyway, as I was working on this post, it just sort of rolled into 2026, so I'll start off my first post of the year with a grab bag of things I found interesting right there at the end of 2025. What's in your Registry? CloudSEK recently shared this write-up on Silver Fox ; what I found most interesting was from \"Stage 4 - Valley RAT\", \"Stage 2\". Apparently, Valley RAT maintains configuration information in the following Registry path: HKCU\\Console In addition, downloaded plugins are stored in the following path: HKCU\\Console\\0\\d33f351a4aeea5e608853d1a56661059 All of this means that not only can you get a great deal of info, and develop a great deal of intel from the entries themselves, but they're also tied to a specific user account. When creating a timeline, paths like those used by the Valley RAT should really stand out. Speaking of Registry and persistence, DeceptIQ shared this write-up on Registry persistence on 27 Dec 2025. As long as I've been working with Windows systems...going back to about 1995, much further if we're talking about \"using\"...this isn't something that I've ever heard of, nor have I run across anything like this. Interestingly enough, the authors didn't just talk about the technique and reference it, but they also linked to a means for creating an NTUSER.MAN file, and even shared how the whole process might look. Information Sharing If you're interested in how shellcode is \"used\" on Windows systems, Valli-Nayagam Chokkalingam over at Adversary Craft shared this \"101\" write-up that you might find useful. I can't say that the write-up leads to viable detection methodologies, as ultimately, finding the shellcode amounts to seeing the bytes in Explorer.exe process memory. However, it is a good \"101\" level write-up for folks to start developing familiarity with the topic. A bit of \"saving the best for last\", but keeping up the \"info sharing\" theme, Brett shared a look back to the early days of DF/IR, and how it was built on PDFs and coffee . I remember those days, because at one point I was writing some of those PDFs, and reading many others. I was reading a lot of the docs that got shared not only to get the information from them, but also to help develop my writing style so that what I wrote up would be entertaining and useful to others. One of the thoughts that Brett's post brought to mind is how we consume information has changed over time. Like Brett said, it used to be PDFs, and in some cases, meeting for coffee (or beer/adult beverages). I started blogging in 2004 because at the time, it seemed like a great way to share information, in one easy-to-reach, easy-to-find location. I know that even since then, there have been folks who've been really successful with YouTube channels, some even getting to the point where they're sponsored. Also, training courses, even those that are self-paced and available online, have been available for some time. In his book Call Sign Chaos , Mattis said that \"our own personal experiences are not enough to sustain us.\" While this statement was directed at warfighters, it remains true for other endeavors, as well, and in particular, the various aspects of cybersecurity. Mattis talked about reading thousands of books, and even described his own reading to expand his knowledge ahead of a campaign. Brett taled about PDFs as a means of sharing knowledge and experiences. In both cases, it's incumbent upon someone to write, to document their experiences and share that knowledge.",

    "summary": "Spent few days analysing MongoDB, please summarize the analysis and findings. (Note I spend more time writing exploits, have dyslexia, and I'm not a native English, an LLM proofreads some sections, if this offends you, stop reading) MongoBleed, tracked as CVE-2025-14847, an unauthenticated memory disclosure vulnerability affecting MongoDB across multiple major versions. It allows remote clients to extract uninitialized heap memory from the MongoDB process using nothing more than valid compressed wire-protocol messages. This is not native RCE . It is a memory leak. it does not leave a lot of traces, It is silent, repeatable, and reachable before authentication. At internet scale, that combination matters more than exploit glamour. TL;DR for engineering teams What broke MongoDB’s zlib decompression path trusts attacker-controlled length metadata. Impact Unauthenticated heap memory disclosure. What leaks Raw process memory fragments including credentials, tokens, config strings, runtime metadata, and recently processed data. Auth required None. Noise level Low. No crashes. No malformed packets. Minimal logs. Exposure 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances observed via Shodan on 29 Dec 2025. Fix Upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression.

When a client negotiates compression, each compressed message includes an uncompressedSize field. The vulnerable flow looks like this: Client sends a syntactically valid compressed MongoDB wire-protocol message Message declares an inflated uncompressedSize MongoDB allocates a heap buffer of that declared size zlib inflates only the real payload into the start of the buffer The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON BSON parsing walks past real data into leftover heap memory Memory gets leaked out, not a lot of IOC to detect Root cause (code-level) The vulnerability originates in MongoDB’s zlib message decompression logic: src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cpp In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returned: return {output.length()}; output.length() represents the allocated buffer size , not the number of bytes actually written by ::uncompress(). If the attacker declares a larger uncompressedSize than the real decompressed payload, MongoDB propagates the allocated size forward. Downstream BSON parsing logic consumes memory beyond the true decompression boundary. The fix replaces this with: return length; length is the actual number of bytes written by the decompressor. Additional regression tests were added in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly reject undersized decompression results with ErrorCodes::BadValue. This closes the disclosure path. Why is this reachable pre-auth Compression negotiation occurs before authentication. The exploit does not require: malformed compression streams memory corruption primitives race conditions timing dependencies It relies on: attacker-controlled metadata valid compression Incorrect length propagation Any network client can trigger it, hence is super easy to deploy Exploitation reality A working proof of concept exists and is public, more details: Original PoC by Joe Desimone https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed/ Technical analysis and reproduction details https://doublepulsar.com/merry-christmas-day-have-a-mongodb-security-incident-9537f54289eb Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca The PoC: negotiates compression sends crafted compressed messages iterates offsets dumps leaked memory fragments to disk and saves it locally No credentials required. No malformed packets. Repeatable probing. What actually leaks Heap memory is messy. That is the point. Observed and expected leak content includes: database credentials SCRAM material session tokens API keys WiredTiger config strings file paths container metadata client IPs and connection details fragments of recently processed documents The PoC output already shows real runtime artifacts. This is not RCE, but steals pieces of memory, which is not as bad as RCE but still very dangerous (Heartbleed anyone) MongoBleed does not provide native remote code execution. There is no instruction pointer control. No shellcode injection. No crash exploitation. What it provides is privilege discovery . Memory disclosure enables: credential reuse token replay service-to-service authentication CI/CD compromise cloud control plane access A leaked Kubernetes token is better than RCE. A leaked CI token is persistent RCE. A leaked cloud role is full environment control. This is RCE-adjacent through legitimate interfaces. How widespread is this MongoDB is everywhere. Shodan telemetry captured on 29 December 2025 shows: 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances Version breakdown (port 27017): Version Count Query All versions 201,659 product:\"MongoDB\" port:27017 8.2.x 3,164 \"8.2.\" 8.0.x (≠8.0.17) 13,411 \"8.0.\" -\"8.0.17\" 7.0.x (≠7.0.28) 19,223 \"7.0.\" -\"7.0.28\" 6.0.x (≠6.0.27) 3,672 \"6.0.\" -\"6.0.27\" 5.0.x (≠5.0.32) 1,887 \"5.0.\" -\"5.0.32\" 4.4.x (≠4.4.30) 3,231 \"4.4.\" -\"4.4.30\" 4.2.x 3,138 \"4.2.\" 4.0.x 3,145 \"4.0.\" 3.6.x 1,145 \"3.6.\" Most are directly exposed on the default port, not shielded behind application tiers. Core behaviors that matter Unauthenticated Any client can trigger it. Remote and repeatable Memory offsets can be probed over time. Low noise No crashes. Logs stay quiet. Data agnostic Whatever was on the heap becomes fair game. This favors patient actors and automation. Detection guidance IOC Identification Network-level signals Look for: Inbound traffic to port 27017 compressed MongoDB messages Repeated requests with: large declared uncompressedSize small actual payloads high request frequency without auth attempts Process-level signals Watch for: elevated CPU on mongod without query load repeated short-lived connections memory allocation spikes abnormal BSON parsing warnings Post-leak fallout Check for: new MongoDB users role changes admin command usage anomalies auth attempts from unfamiliar IPs API key failures cloud IAM abuse new outbound connections If you see filesystem artifacts or shells, you are already past exploitation. Temporary protections If you cannot upgrade immediately: Disable zlib compression Remove zlib from networkMessageCompressors Restrict network access Remove direct internet exposure Enforce allowlists These are stopgaps. The bug lives in the server - hence patch Tooling and validation A full test suite is available, combining: exploit lab (vulnerable + patched instances) network scanner code scanner for repos and Dockerfiles Repository: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847 This allows: safe reproduction exposure validation pre-deployment detection Why this one matters MongoBleed does not break crypto it breaks data and memory The database trusts client-supplied lengths. Attackers live for that assumption. Databases are part of your application attack surface. Infrastructure bugs leak application secrets. Vulnerability management without reachability is incomplete.

I’ve put together a deep-dive forensic breakdown of exactly how the architecture failed. The TL;DR on the Architectural Breakdown: The Entry Point: A legacy Citrix remote access portal that was never fully migrated to modern identity governance. [ 05:02 ] The Fatal Flaw: Zero MFA. Valid credentials were used to walk right through the \"front door\" without a single challenge. [ 01:27 , 06:54 ] The 9-Day Dwell Time: Attackers spent over a week \"living off the land,\" blending into normal admin traffic to map domain controllers and move laterally. [ 07:30 , 08:02 ] Exfiltration Scale: Approximately 6TB of data (touching 1 in 3 US patient records) was stolen before the encryption payload was even detonated. [ 02:30 , 08:26 ] The Reliability Paradox: The systemic outage was actually triggered by the containment effort. Severing the \"infected limb\" logically and physically also killed the essential transaction engines and redundancy systems that were too tightly coupled to the primary infrastructure. [ 09:13 , 09:30 ] Key Takeaways for Senior Engineers & Architects: Identity is the New Perimeter: Firewalls are irrelevant if your IdP is weak. Without MFA on every single external entry point, you don’t have a perimeter; you have a welcome mat. [ 12:05 , 12:30 ] The M&A Quarantine Rule: Assume any acquired network is already compromised. Treat it as \"hostile internet\" until every endpoint meets your security baseline. Do not bridge the networks prematurely. [ 12:43 , 12:58 ] Complexity is the Sanctuary of the Adversary: The more complex your legacy footprint, the more shadows there are for attackers to hide in. Simplification isn't just an operational goal—it’s a security mandate.

    "summary": "First, I want to point out that AI/ML does not refer to LLMs, either their use/development of, or ability to integrate them into their own particular skill set. I'm referring to the use of unsupervised learning, clustering, embeddings, regression analysis, pattern detection, time series analysis...you know, that stuff. I'm a senior level analyst (threat hunter) that specializes in data science and machine learning. I picked up the additional skills while learning how to hunt through data to detect anomalies and how to differentiate them from normal behaviors but I use those as analytical tools. To paint a clearer picture, I code out these models and representations myself rather than using typical tools and bolted-on capabilities in existing SIEMs, so it's still much more into the weeds in the DS side. I mention that above to ask if those types of skills are sought after while looking through applications and resumes. I rarely see them in many job postings that aren't DS-specific roles. Personally, I see these skills as highly desirable in a top-tier analyst when paired with a competency and exposure to many of the most common tools and platforms in modern security operations because most of secops is reactive with extra time being available to proficient analysts who can knock out alerts quickly and efficiently. That extra time should be spent digging through data, low-level alerts, and logs, looking for anything that might have been missed. It doesn't need to be said that that is a lot of data to dive into. The bottleneck is analysts' ability to parse the information and correlate. And here is where I find those DS/ML skills really paying off. Sure, there's some bootstrapping time invested in building out a pipeline but once that is done (correctly) and it's put to use, it hoovers in data and spits out knowledge objects useful for hunting and meta-analysis. Sorry if it sounds like I'm on a soapbox, I was trying to explain the benefits of having the skills. Rather than relying on LLMs or bolted-on AI agents in security appliances to find the things that are missed, having a human involved in that process is necessary and would be an advantageous posture. Someone who isn't knowledgeable doesn't help because you don't know what you don't know (ie, lacking threat hunting and/or DS skills) and also, we know that LLMs hallucinate. I'm not dogging chatbots and intelligent agents, I'm just trying to block the \"yea, we use AI (LLMs) for that\" argument. Getting back to the original question--are those skills a plus for the roles you are looking to fill? Would you pass up a candidate if they had those skills over a similar candidate who didn't? Are leads in your organization looking to bring both cyber analytical and DS/ML skills together into a single role?

Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Post-American Internet (permalink) On December 28th, I delivered a speech entitled \"A post-American, enshittification-resistant internet\" for 39C3, the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Germany. This is the transcript of that speech. https://archive.org/download/doctorow-39c3/39c3-1421-eng-A_post-American_enshittification-resistant_internet.mp4 Many of you know that I'm an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF. I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call \"The War on General Purpose Computing.\" If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the \"Broadcast Protection Discussion Group,\" an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators. They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders. That rule was called \"the Broadcast Flag,\" and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule. We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years. Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked. Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack! And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door. Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a \"Post-American Internet,\" a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not happy about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say \"When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla.\" The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage. That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos. A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are everything. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want all the same thing as the original forces, but want enough of the same things to fight on their side. That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described \"libertarians\" who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel. And what's got me so excited is that we've got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but also people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, and national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty. My thesis here is that this is an unstoppable coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp. # So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the \"War on General Purpose Computing.\" That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is \"anticircumvention,\" Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true whether or not your modification violates any other law. Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an \"access control\" for a copyrighted work. So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about how to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even describe how they access a device or system face criminal liability. Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects. This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls \"Felony Contempt of Business Model.\" Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every other country in the world has passed a law just like this in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive. Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges. But why would Europe pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech importer. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this? Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which other countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question. Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law. Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws. Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws. And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too. I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft? Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me. They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, \"You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry.\" That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash. The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now! I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day? So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: \"Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you.\" This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking Greenland. Capitulation is a failure. But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy more expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says \"Ouch!\" And it's indiscriminate. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada. But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law? If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad. Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit. Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their own government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product. So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing. It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just one example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a 30 percent commission on every euro spent inside of an app. 30 percent! That's such a profitable business that Apple makes $100 billion per year on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors. Those competitors could offer a 90% discount every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and still make $10b/year. Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then Apple would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" With these guys, it's always \"disruption for thee, but not for me.\" When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral. Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break kings! It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class. I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly not an accelerationist. Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of. And while those stores could use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be more expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps. When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR. It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones. All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover. Back in October, Apple kicked the \"ICE Block\" app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a \"protected class,\" and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons. And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy. Apple's margin could be their opportunity. Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a much better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs. For one thing, this is a targeted response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais. Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans and everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies. It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in. So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars selling that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world. That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings. Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars? Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who I believe. This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service. The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire nation. The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to hack Outlook to brick the ICC – they own Outlook. Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose any of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he \"couldn't guarantee\" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened. It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em. John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they can't brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government. Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to \"digital sovereignty.\" But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned \"digital sovereignty\" from a nice-to-have into a must-have. So finally, we're seeing some movement, like \"Eurostack,\" a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on. But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories. We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are not going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform. Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers. Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work without the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it West Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall. Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation. So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be totally unreliable. This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks. This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the \"Underground Empire.\" But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump. Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links. But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub. It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy. They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use? Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world. Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem. But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative. No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start. But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code. This project is the only one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country. It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances. We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working. The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – those are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years. Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users, balancing out that liability among many players. Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's good that they've got a chatbot that \"produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer.\" Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale. This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that can't do your job. Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the workers stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt. Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers. When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: \"Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act.\" Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a fucking idiot suit and tell you \"Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie.\" Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit. AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders. When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship. But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you. Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing. Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't real. Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an \"NPC,” or all those \"Effective Altruists,\" who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today. Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the \"Genesis\" program, declaring that the US would begin generating annual \"moonshot\"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists. Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real. Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to do things telling you \"no.\" AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory. Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to reduce tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty. Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously? But crises precipitate change. Remember when another mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years behind in its energy transition, to ten years ahead of schedule. Because when you're shivering the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony. But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass. Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. Any country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder. Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter. Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive \"K-shaped\" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages. So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation. The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger. America is chasing the \"world without people\" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself. Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military \"right to repair\" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine. The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own. But what if European firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. \"Good news,\" because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable. Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year. Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic. Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share any of that money with BMW and Mercedes. Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest \"tax-inversion\" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea. Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed. It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people. There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company \"helpfully\" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform \"diagnostics,\" which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros. Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products. So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks. I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry \"Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?\" The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability. By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit. Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on. Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking weird how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding who you want to talk to? The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit. It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet! Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box. Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am hopeful. Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed. Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair. All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I and Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in China. This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power. Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations. The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level. And never forget that the post-American internet will be good for Americans. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies. The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a victim of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech. That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world. The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too. And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It's gonna be great.

    "title": "A supplier outage turned into a security incident halfway through incident response",
    "summary": "I work on the internal security team at a regulated payments company. We process card transactions for other businesses, so outages immediately hit revenue and compliance nerves at the same time. The incident response bridge was opened when a supplier that handles part of our transaction routing began timing out during peak volume. At the beginning it was framed as an availability issue, with transactions backing up and pressure building to provide a clear restoration timeline to the business. I joined because the integration touches regulated data, but the expectation was still that security would stay in the background unless something obviously malicious surfaced. About half an hour in, while people were debating rollback options, I started looking at the logs we were sharing. The retry traffic looked wrong. Requests were hitting endpoints that are not part of the documented production path. The supplier kept repeating that nothing had changed and that they were failing over internally to keep service alive. What they did not mention until later was that the failover path routes through an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked, which is why no alarms fired, but it bypasses one of our monitoring layers and handles data differently. We never designed it to run under load, let alone during an incident. At that point I said out loud that this stopped being a clean outage. The response was immediate pushback. Procurement jumped in to say the supplier had already been reviewed and approved. Someone referenced the third-party record and said Panorays showed no active issues, like that settled the question. The score had not changed, so in their minds the risk had not either. I am watching live traffic move through a path we do not actively control while the incident is still in progress and recovery speed has become the dominant concern. Everyone else wants to keep the scope narrow so the bridge can be closed and the issue treated as resolved. I am stuck trying to explain why a system behaving exactly as it was never meant to behave cannot just be dismissed as operational noise. How do I push to reclassify this without being remembered as the person who delayed recovery and forced old approval decisions back into active dispute? submitted by /u/Dismal_Marzipan1430 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Best phishing awareness platforms for 2025/2026: addressing realism gaps in internal security training.",
    "summary": "Over the last few years, phising awareness platforms and simulation softwares have become standard across orgs of all sizes. Most security teams now run phishing simulations, tracks and measures employees through dashboard and reports. Despite this, real world phishing attacks and business email compromise incidents continue to succeed. A common issue is that many phishing programs rely heavily on external phishing templates, training employees to recognize patterns rather than make decisions in realistic workplace scenarios. Approval request, shared docs, internal messages remain a frequent source of security fail. These attacks closely mirror everyday workflows and are often underrepresented in traditional phishing awareness training. As phishing techniques evolve in 2026, including AI generated phishing and highly targeted spear phishing, the gap between phishing simulations metrics and real risk is becoming harder to ignore. Reduced risk rates do not always translate into improved security behaviour. We are currently evaluating phishing awareness software and prevention platforms, looking for approaches that move beyond template driven simulations and focus on realistic phishing scenarios, internal and external context, and measurable reduction in human risk. Interested to hearhow others are addressing internal phishing threats today, whether by extending existing tools or exploring newer phishing awareness platforms designed around realism and less focusing on scores. submitted by /u/Ok-Author-6130 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Critical vulnerability in IBM API Connect could allow authentication bypass",
    "summary": "IBM is urging customers to quickly patch a critical vulnerability in its API Connect platform that could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication. The company describes API Connect as a full lifecycle application programming interface (API) gateway used “to create, test, manage, secure, analyze, and socialize APIs.” It particularly touts it as a way to “unlock the potential of agentic AI” by providing a central point of control for access to AI services via APIs. The platform also includes API Agent, which automates tasks across the API lifecycle using AI. A key component is a customizable self-service portal that allows developers to easily onboard themselves, and to discover and consume multiple types of API, including SOAP, REST, events, ASyncAPIs, GraphQL, and others. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-13915 , affects IBM API Connect versions 10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5, and version 10.0.11.0, and could give unauthorized access to the exposed applications, with no user interaction required. An architectural assumption is broken “CVE-2025-13915 is not best understood as a security bug,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia , chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “It is better understood as a moment where a long standing architectural assumption finally breaks in the open. The assumption is simple and deeply embedded in enterprise design: If traffic passes through the API gateway, identity has been enforced and trust has been established. This vulnerability proves that assumption can fail completely.” He noted that the classification of the weakness, which maps to CWE-305 , is important because it rules out a whole class of what he called comforting explanations. “This is not stolen credentials. It is not role misconfiguration. It is not a permissions mistake,” he said. “The authentication enforcement itself can be circumvented.” When that happens, he explained, downstream services do not simply face elevated risk, they lose the foundation on which their access decisions were built because they do not revalidate identity. They were never designed to; they inherit trust. “Once enforcement fails upstream, inherited trust becomes unearned trust, and the exposure propagates silently,” he said. “This class of vulnerability aligns with automation, broad scanning, and opportunistic probing rather than careful targeting.” Interim fixes provided IBM said that the issue was discovered during internal testing, and it has provided interim fixes for each affected version of the software, with individual update details for VMware, OCP/CP4I, and Kubernetes. The only mitigation suggested for the flaw, according to IBM’s security bulletin , is this: “Customers unable to install the interim fix should disable self-service sign-up on their Developer Portal if enabled, which will help minimize their exposure to this vulnerability.” The company also notes in its installation instructions for the fixes that the image overrides described in the document must be removed when upgrading to the next release or fixpack. This, said Gogia, further elevates the risk. “That is not a cosmetic detail,” he noted. “Management planes define configuration truth, lifecycle control, and operational authority across the platform. When remediation touches this layer, the vulnerability sits close to the control core, not at an isolated gateway edge. That raises both blast radius and remediation risk.” This is because errors in these areas can turn into prolonged exposure or service instability. “[Image overrides] also introduce a governance hazard: Image overrides create shadow state; if they are not explicitly removed later, they persist quietly,” he pointed out. “Over time, they drift out of visibility, ownership, and audit scope. This is how temporary fixes turn into long term risk.” Most valuable outcome: Learning He added that the operational challenges involved in remediation are not so much in knowing what has to be done, but in doing it fast enough without breaking the business. And, he said, API governance now needs to include up to date inventories of APIs, their versions, dependencies, and exposure points, as well as monitoring of behavior. “The most valuable outcome here is not closure,” Gogia observed. “It is learning. Enterprises should ask what would have happened if this flaw had been exploited quietly for weeks. Which services would have trusted the gateway implicitly? Which logs would have shown abnormal behavior? Which teams would have noticed first? Those answers reveal whether trust assumptions are visible or invisible. Organizations that stop at patching will miss a rare opportunity to strengthen resilience before the next control plane failure arrives.” This article originally appeared on InfoWorld .",

I have a PhD in experimental psychology and am working on assessments, helping carry out behavioral research studies for the federal government. I’m excited about this and I love the role, and I’ll be making low 6 figures. However, this role is not exactly common and I worry about what I would do next if I were to get laid off. Cybersecurity seems to be a lucrative field pay wise, and with my TS clearance I think I would be a sought after candidate. Plus, the cybersecurity roles will pay very well! I think this role will be quite stable for 4-5 years. In the meantime, evening and stuff, I’d like to start learning cyber security. I’d consider myself a fairly smart person but I have a very minimal coding background, just a bit of R. If some could point me down a path or to some resources that would be really great!
