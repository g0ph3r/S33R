Earlier last year ( Part 1 and Part 2 ) we shared examples of how you can use workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel to build a custom email security insights dashboard for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security. Today we are excited to announce a brand-new Power BI template file designed for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security customers. Additionally, we've released an updated version of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook within Microsoft Sentinel. Both offerings feature a unified visual design and structure, ensuring consistent experience no matter which platform you use. Power BI template file - Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights: Microsoft Sentinel workbook - Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights: New: Power BI template file for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights This custom reporting template file utilizes Power BI and Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting through the Microsoft Graph security API . This solution is intended for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security users who have access to Advanced Hunting but do not use Microsoft Sentinel. You can view Advanced Hunting data from Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration tables for up to 30 days. The reporting template leverages these same tables to present key insights about your organization's email security, showcasing protection, detection, and response metrics supplied by Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security. Note: If data retention beyond 30 days is required, customers can use the Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel. You can find the new .pbit template file and detailed instructions on how to set up and use it in the unified Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender GitHub repository . This new Power BI template uses the same visuals and structure as the Microsoft Defender Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel, providing an easy way to gain deep email security insights across a wide range of use cases. Updated: Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel We are excited to announce the release of a new version (3) of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel. The workbook is part of the Microsoft Defender solution in Microsoft Sentinel and can be installed and started to use with a few simple clicks. In this release, we have integrated feedback from customers collected over the past several months to introduce new visuals, enhance existing ones, and provide insights aimed at strengthening security operations What’s New Here are some notable changes and new capabilities available in the updated workbook template. Improved structure: Headings and grouped insights have been added to tabs for easier navigation and understanding of metrics. Contextual explanations: Each tab, section, and visual now includes descriptions to help users interpret insights effectively. Drill-down capability: A single “Open query link” action allows users to view the underlying KQL query for each visual, enabling quick investigation and hunting by modifying conditions or removing summaries to access raw data. Detection Dashboard tab enhancements: Added an example Effectiveness metric , updated visuals to focus on overall Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration protection values and introduced new sections for Emerging Threats and Microsoft 365 Secure Email Gateway Performance. New Security Operations Center (SOC) Insights tab: Provides operational metrics such as Security Incident Response, Investigation, and Response Actions for SOC teams. Advanced threat insights: Includes new LLM-based content analysis detections and threat classification insights on the Emails – Phish Detections tab. External forwarding insights: Added deep visibility into Inbox rules and SMTP forwarding in Outlook , including destination details to assess potential data leakage risks. Geo-location improvements: Sender IPv4 insights now include top countries for better geographic context for each Threat types (Malware, Spam, Phish). Enhanced top attacked users and top senders: Added TotalEmailCount and Bad_Traffic_Percentage for richer context in top attacked users and senders charts. Expanded URL click insights: URL click-based threat detection visuals now include Microsoft 365 Copilot as a workload. How to use the workbook across multiple tenants If you manage multiple environments with Microsoft Sentinel or you are an MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) working across multiple customer tenants, you can also use the workbook in multi‑tenant scenarios. Once the required configuration is in place, you can change the Subscription and Workspace parameters in the workbook to be multi select and load data from one or multiple tenants. This functionality provides comprehensive email security analytics within multi-tenant environments, including: Aggregated multi‑tenant view: You can view aggregated insights across tenants in a single workbook view . By multi‑selecting tenants in the Subscription and Workspace parameters, the workbook automatically loads and combines data from all selected environments for all visuals on all tabs. Side‑by-side‑ comparison: For example, you can compare phishing detection trends or top attacked users across two or more tenants simply by opening the workbook in two browser windows placed side by side. Note: For the multiselect option‑ to work in the current workbook version, you need to manually adjust the Subscription and Workspace parameters. This configuration is planned to become the default in the next release of the workbook. Until then, you can simply apply this change using the workbook’s Edit mode. How to get the updated workbook version The latest version of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook is available as part of the Microsoft Defender solution in the Microsoft Sentinel - Content hub. Version 3.0.13 of the solution has the updated workbook template. If you already have the Microsoft Defender deployed, version 3.0.13 is available now as an update. After you install the update, you will have the new workbook template available to use. When Microsoft Defender is installed for the first time, the latest version is deployed, and the updated template becomes available for immediate use. Editing and sharing the workbook You can customize each visual easily. Simply edit the workbook after saving, then adjust the underlying KQL query, change the type of the visual, or create new insights.

We identified an issue where the HMAC secret key is stored in environment variables and disclosed via the DescribeTrainingJob API. This allows third parties with DescribeTrainingJob permissions to extract the key, forge cloud-pickled payloads with valid HMACs, and overwrite S3 objects. CVE-2026-1778 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. We identified an issue where SSL certificate verification was globally disabled in the Triton Python backend. This configuration was introduced to work around SSL errors during model downloads from public sources (e.g., TorchVision) and it affected all HTTPS connections when the Triton Python model was imported. Impacted versions: - HMAC Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v3 - HMAC Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v2 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v3 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v2 Please refer to the article below for the most up-to-date and complete information related to this AWS Security Bulletin.",

NTLM is a series of security protocols that were introduced in the 1990s, but since Kerberos became the default protocol in Windows 2000, its use has declined with each passing year. Still, many legacy enterprise systems still support or use NTLM, making them vulnerability to NTLM relay attacks , for example. And while Microsoft administrators have been preparing for the demise of NTLM for years , many still struggle to rid their networks of the protocol . In recent years, hackers have exploited NTLM flaws to gain full access to networks, so the disadvantages of supporting it outweigh the advantages. Microsoft now considers NTLM deprecated. A timetable for the deactivation can be found on the Windows IT Pro Blog .",

    "title": "Devices",
    "summary": "Something I learned very early on as a DF/IR consultant was that you're likely never going to run into a perfect environment as an on-call responder. In fact, the best you can hope for is an environment with the default logging, for the OS and applications, and that the logs haven't been cleared. Even then, those two conditions aren't always the case. Even today, in 2026, I regularly see environments where auditing of successful logins has been disabled, so they don't appear in the Security Event Log. As such, it's not only important to keep up with what's available from the default installation of an endpoint, and what sources can be used to validate your findings, but also note what's available depending upon the applications installed. However, what's most important are your analysis goals. For example, it's easy to say, \"I want to see all USB devices connected to the endpoint\", and not provide a timeframe. However, to what are these devices pursuant? IP theft? Violation of acceptable use policies? What about CSAM production? After all, smartphones and digital cameras can be connected to a computer via a USB cable, but use different protocols, and information about the devices being connected can be found in other locations than those that we traditionally look to as a result of training we may receive. When it comes to devices connected to a Windows system, things have definitely changed over time. Cory and I published a peer-reviewed paper in 2005 , covering USB artifacts on Windows XP systems. Since then, there's been quite a few changes to Windows, and as one would expect, how devices connected to an endpoint are tracked. Nicole mentioned some time ago (2014) that different protocols used by different devices (in this case, smartphones) have an impact on investigations; unfortunately, as time has gone on, I've had a hard time linking back to Nicole's published research or even her presentations, but one of her presentations can be found here . This WindowsIR blog post describes the fact that some of the Windows Event Log files we might look to in order to investigate USB devices connected to an endpoint have been seen to be disabled, and recommended some alternative data sources. Similarly, this NirSoft page for the USBDeView application similarly recommends data sources. Speaking of the WindowsIR blog, here's a whole series of blog posts about just \"USB devices\". Now, as to why I'm writing this blog post, in the first place... I recently ran across this LinkedIn post from Garrett Moreau, which I thought was interesting. He's right, in that information about devices connected to/removed from the endpoint is stored in the Registry, and not just in the USBStor key. RegRipper , for example, includes multiple plugins within the \"devices\" category. What's really eye-opening is to read through the comments to the post; one comment, for example, states the following: Quick note for defenders, default logging settings don’t provide much depth. USB events are recorded under the Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > DriverFrameworks-UserMode > Operational path, but this log must be activated manually. Previous versions of Windows required activation of these events using PowerShell. While the statement is true, this goes back to what I said earlier about traditional training, and the need to not only keep playbooks up to date, but to also pursue other alternative data sources. A data source we're familiar with, the Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode Event Log , is now disabled by default, and as stated, doesn't provide \"much depth\". However, if understanding the USB devices connected to an endpoint are part of your investigative goals, then keeping playbooks updated is key. Some of the comments go one to suggest other data sources that might be used to add granularity or context to your investigations, such as shellbags (for directory transversal), etc. In the past, I've found the Application Event Log, and in particular, MsiInstaller events to be useful in illustrating attempts to install applications from a USB device. My recommendation is this...first and foremost, understand your analysis goals; what are you attempting to show, to prove or disprove? From there, maintain playbooks associated with these goals, and if you're in a role where you're dealing with different implementations and applications, keep documentation on any new findings that apply to specific edge cases, as you never know when you will see such things again. An excellent example of this is when Don Weber worked a case where the LANDesk Software Monitoring application was installed on an endpoint, and found that the application provided valuable information regarding program execution .",

This flaw allowed a low-privileged attacker to bypass Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls and invoke authenticated Cloud Run services despite lacking permissions. Cloud Monitoring Uptime Checks can be configured to authenticate against HTTP targets using the Monitoring Service Agent's ID token. The Monitoring Service Agent (service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-monitoring-notification.iam.gserviceaccount.com) is a Google-managed identity that, by default, is granted the run.routes.invoke permission. This permission allows the holder to call authenticated Cloud Run endpoints. By testing an Uptime Check on an authenticated Cloud Run endpoint, an attacker with the extremely limited monitoring.uptimeCheckConfigViewer role could invoke that endpoint with arbitrary parameters using the Service Agent’s identity.

    "summary": "Welcome to volume twenty-seven of Scrolls , a newsletter for sharing cool stuff from the IndieWeb , Fediverse & Cybersecurity realms. This week we ponder a better, although imperfect web, we encourage everyone to join the Fediverse movement, and sigh … AI continues to make us sad. But ya know what doesn’t make me sad? This dope bird mage. 🐦 🧙 IndieWeb The “old web” wasn’t perfect , but it’s hard to look at what the web has become and not wonder how it was lost . Those that remember have sought to build a once-again “open web”, but things are never that simple . Problems abound in this quest to be sure, but for every obstacle, there are ways to mitigate and build a better, more open, more cooperative , more human web—it doesn’t need to be perfect . The lifeblood of this better web is the classic personal website . If you don’t already have one, what better time than now to do so! There are so many ways to get one up and running. There are a lot of reasons to have your own website and do some blogging there too! And no, simply having a social media presence is no substitute for an actual website that you own . Personally, I like having both a website and a standard (Fedi) social media presence. But there are options for making your website/blog plenty social if you’d like. In fact, when it’s your site, it can be whatever you want it to be . You own it, so you can tinker with it to your hearts content , no obligations . You can update and change whatever you want, whenever you want. If you’re worried about the technical aspects of creating and managing a website, don’t ! There’s plenty of no code or low-code options available. Does your website have to be good? Does it need to look like other people’s sites ? No ! In fact, I’d encourage you to make it unique. Make it you . Hell , make it purposefully worse than other sites you see. Honestly that’s the beauty of the personal, IndieWeb. Doin’ whatever you like. Fediverse Who would you rather trust to safeguard your online communities , your digital relationships, and your personal presence/identity on the web? Elon Musk? Mark Zuckerberg? Some other billionaire or privacy annihilating big tech entity? Or would you trust your actual community? This isn’t fantasy. There are real options to build , maintain and join online communities no longer reliant on the traditional tectonics of “big social”. Your first step? Simply sign-up . Congratulations , you are now a hero . Perhaps you’re concerned that the “ Fediverse ”, or the “Social Web” is simply too fledgling for you to entrust something this important to—to invest this much time into. Well , I’d still argue that given the alternative, it’s worth it regardless. But if it allays any fears you might have, take some time to do some research and see all the work that is being put into making this big-tech-free web a reality. There’s so much innovation to be found! We’ve got E2E encryption coming courtesy of the Public Key Directory , LinkedIn will soon be a thing of the past , we’re bridging networks and eradicating mansplaining while we’re at it. Come join us! Cybersecurity AI isn’t secure . AI can’t be trusted . But AI lives on . Patch yo shit. Thanks for reading Scrolls ! Time to go goblin mode…",

    "title": "Build intelligent employee onboarding with Gemini Enterprise",
    "summary": "Employee onboarding is rarely a linear process. It’s a complex web of dependencies that vary significantly based on an individual’s specific profile. For example, even a simple request for a laptop requires the system to cross-reference the employee’s role, function, and seniority level to determine whether they need a high-powered workstation or a standard mobile device. Similarly, requesting a building pass involves more than just a name tag; it requires integrating data regarding the employee’s assigned office location, desk neighborhood, and the specific system requirements of the underlying access management system. In this article, we show you how d evelopers use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) , Agent Engine, and Application Integration to build custom agents that connect into your enterprise systems (such as ITSM, ERP, and CRM). Once built, these agents are published to the Gemini Enterprise agent gallery, where employees can easily access and interact with them. The result is a more personal employee onboarding experience. Read on to learn how to connect conversational AI with your essential enterprise systems. aside_block ), ('btn_text', ''), ('href', ''), ('image', None)])]> First, what is an agent powered application integration workflow? Figure 1: ADK Agent architecture with tools Figure 2: Low-code tools for agent with application Integration A grounded agentic workflow is a modern architectural pattern. It bridges the gap between the creative, probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs) and the rigid, deterministic nature of business logic. It consists of three critical components: Gemini Enterprise custom agent : This front-end interface understands natural language, gathers information through dialogue, and provides a user-friendly experience. Built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and deployed to Agent Engine, this multi-agent architecture acts as an intelligent assistant with precision and accuracy. Automation and connectivity layer : This middleware handles complex data transformations, authentication, and communication with backend systems. Application Integration provides a visual, low-code environment to build deterministic automation processes using out-of-the-box connectors. Enterprise backend system : This is the system of record where business transactions are executed—in this case, the corporate IT Service Management (ITSM) platform. When these components work together, the agent understands user intent, the integration layer routes data correctly, and the backend system processes the transaction. The user experiences a simple conversation, while complex enterprise workflows execute in the background. Use case: Laptop request for new employees Let's explore a practical scenario that every organization faces: The problem : Sarah from HR needs to request a laptop for a new software engineer joining next Monday. The traditional process requires her to: Log into the ITSM portal Read internal website to find out how to raise a laptop request Navigate multiple pages to find the hardware request form Search for meaning of different fields, the right team to raise to Finally submit the form The solution : With our agent-powered workflow, Sarah can simply express her intent, and accept the default configuration: code_block )])]> What happens behind the scenes? Agent processing : Gemini understood the intent, gathered required information through conversation, and determined the appropriate laptop configuration based on job role Tool calling : Agent triggers Application Integration workflow with structured data Integration workflow : Application Integration received the request, transformed data to ITSM format, handled authentication, and created the service request ITSM transaction : Created a catalog service request item with all necessary fields, assigned to appropriate fulfillment team, and triggered approval workflow Response flow : ITSM returned request details, Application Integration formatted the response, and Agent presented information in user-friendly format Application integration For demonstration purposes, we created a simple workflow to simulate a laptop selection process which needed to follow specific business rules/requirements, such as checking the hardware entitlements of the employee based on their assigned role, checking hardware availability and finally filtering out unavailable options using low code/no code development practices. Figure 3: Low-code tool development using Application Integration This workflow was then published and made available as an API endpoint which was configured to be used as a tool in ADK code (see below).

    "title": "Introducing Single-tenant Cloud HSM to support more data encryption control",
    "summary": "Organizations that handle sensitive data in highly-regulated sectors often face a difficult choice: Build and manage physical hardware to meet strict compliance needs, or use cloud services that might not offer the specific level of isolation they require. These organizations, often in financial services, defense, healthcare, insurance, and government, require a key management service to provide cryptographic assurances that no one else — including their cloud provider — can access their keys. The key management service also needs to be highly available and scalable to ensure that protected sensitive data is accessible by business critical applications without disruption. To help meet these rigorous standards without taking on the burden of physical hardware management, we are introducing Single-tenant Cloud HSM , a new service that provides a dedicated, highly-available cluster of hardware security module (HSM) partitions where you retain full control over your cryptographic keys. Single-tenant Cloud HSM is generally available today in the U.S. and European Union today with competitive pricing . We plan on adding more regions and capabilities throughout the year. Control your keys with hardware-enforced isolation Single-tenant Cloud HSM is designed for workloads that require FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation, isolation from other users, and greater security controls on the HSM. Unlike multi-tenant solutions, this service ensures you are the sole tenant on a partition of a physical HSM. The hardware itself enforces cryptographic isolation, meaning your keys are separated from other customers and from Google operators. To ensure you maintain control over your data, the service includes several critical security features: Full ownership : You control the root key and root key access for your partition. Quorum-based administration : Sensitive operations are rooted in hardware and require quorum approval, preventing any single individual from making unauthorized changes. Revocation : You have the ability to revoke Google’s access at any time. This action will result in all the keys in the instance becoming unavailable and the data encrypted with those keys inaccessible. Reduce operational overhead without sacrificing security Managing physical HSMs usually involves significant work, from procurement to maintenance. With Single-tenant Cloud HSM, Google manages the provisioning, configuration, monitoring and compliance of the hardware. This allows you to focus on security policies rather than hardware maintenance. The service is also designed for high availability and redundancy, allowing you to provision in minutes and scale as your workloads grow. How does Single-tenant Cloud HSM work? To understand the level of control you have, it helps to look at the authentication flow. You own and manage your Administrative user credentials directly. You can generate these key pairs on a hardware token like a YubiKey or with another key management system of your choice. To prevent unauthorized access, you must set up multiple users and configure your instance to require a quorum (M of N). This ensures that a specific number of authorized users must agree to grant or revoke permissions. Figure 1: Single-tenant Cloud HSM high-level architecture. With this setup, your administrators can: Authorize Google to perform cryptographic operations on your Single-tenant Cloud HSM Instance. Revoke Google's authorization at any time. Figure 2: Single-tenant Cloud HSM: Revoking Google’s access. In summary: Each Single-tenant Cloud HSM instance is a dedicated and cryptographically cluster of HSM partitions for your exclusive use. Each Single-tenant instance provides the same redundancy and high availability as multi-tenant Cloud HSM. You can revoke Google’s authorization to an instance, making all keys in that instance unavailable and it can only be restored after granting the authorization again. Features and benefits Meeting compliance and security standards : Single-tenant Cloud HSM is built for customers who want to run cloud workloads that meet stringent security and regulatory standards. Single-tenant Cloud HSM uses FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated Marvell LiquidSecurity HSMs (models CNL3560-NFBE-2.0-G and CNL3560-NFBE-3.0-G) with firmware versions 3.4 build 10. The Single-tenant Cloud HSM service has obtained compliance with numerous regulations and certifications including FedRAMP , DISA IL5 , ITAR , SOC 1 / SOC 2 / SOC 3 , HIPPA and PCI DSS . These standards and certifications help customers in highly-regulated market segments meet their regulatory and compliance needs for key management and data protection. Set up your instance in minutes : You can set up a Single-tenant Cloud HSM instance quickly using standard gcloud commands for all administrative operations. Once you have established the necessary quorum for administrative access, you can provision a complete cluster in approximately 15 minutes. Scale automatically with high availability : Single-tenant Cloud HSM instances span multiple zones to ensure reliability, matching the availability standards of Cloud HSM. The service also scales automatically to handle your peak traffic loads, ensuring consistent performance without manual intervention. Integrated with the tools you already use : You can use Single-tenant Cloud HSM with your existing workflows immediately. It works with existing Cloud Key Management System (KMS) APIs, allowing you to use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to protect data across Google Cloud services. It also integrates with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring, giving you analytics, alerts, and visibility into your key usage.

    "title": "High-performance inference meets serverless compute with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 on Cloud Run",
    "summary": "Running large-scale inference models can involve significant operational toil, including cluster management and manual VM maintenance. One solution is to leverage a serverless compute platform to abstract away the underlying infrastructure. Today, we’re bringing the serverless experience to high-end inference with support for NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs on Cloud Run. Now in preview, you can deploy massive models like Gemma 3 27B or Llama 3.1 70B with the 'deploy and forget' experience you’ve come to expect from Cloud Run. No reservations. No cluster management. Just code. A powerful GPU platform The NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU provides a huge leap in performance compared to the NVIDIA L4 GPU, bringing 96GB vGPU memory, 1.6 TB/s of bandwidth and support for FP4 and FP6. This means you can serve up to 70B+ parameter models without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Cloud Run lets you attach a NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU to your Cloud Run service, job, or worker pools, on demand, with no reservations required. Here are some ways you can use the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU to accelerate your business: Generative AI and inference: With its FP4 precision support, the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU’s high-efficiency compute accelerates LLM fine-tuning and inference, letting you create real-time generative AI applications such as multi-modal and text-to-image creation models. By running your model on Cloud Run services , you can also take advantage of rapid startup and scaling, going from zero instances to having a GPU with drivers installed under 5 seconds. When traffic eventually scales down zero and no more requests are being received, Cloud Run automatically scales your GPU instances down to zero. Fine-tuning and offline inference : NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs can be used in conjunction with Cloud Run jobs to fine-tune your model. The fifth-generation NVIDIA Tensor Cores can be used in conjunction with AI models to help accelerate rendering pipelines and enhance content creation. Tailored scaling for specialized workloads : Use GPU-enabled worker pools to apply granular control over your GPU workers, whether you need to dynamically scale based on custom external metrics or manually provision \"always-on\" instances for complex, stateful processing. We built Cloud Run to be the simplest way to run production-ready, GPU-accelerated tasks. Some highlights of Cloud Run include: Managed GPUs with flexible compute: Cloud Run pre-installs the necessary NVIDIA drivers so you can focus on your code. Cloud Run instances using NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs can configure up to 44 vCPU and 176GB of RAM. Production-grade reliability: By default, Cloud Run offers zonal redundancy, helping to ensure enough capacity for your service to be resilient to a zonal outage; this also applies to Cloud Run with GPUs. Alternatively, you can turn off zonal redundancy and benefit from a lower price for best-effort failover of your GPU workloads in case of a zonal outage. Tight integration : Cloud Run works natively with the rest of Google Cloud. You can load massive model weights by mounting Cloud Storage buckets as local volumes, or use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to secure traffic that’s bound for a Cloud Run service. Get started The NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU is available in preview on demand with availability in us-central1 and europe-west4 , and limited availability in asia-south2 and asia-southeast1 .

Object permanence: Acme License-Plate Maker; IPV4 delenda est; Mandatory gun-ownership; Sukey; Ross and Carrie x LRH; Criti-hype. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Stock swindles (permalink) There are plenty of American historical antecedents of Trumpism – fascist movements like the Jim Crow reign of terror, the McCarthy hearings, the gleeful genocide of indigenous people. But when you're thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn't just a nation of cruel bigots; it's also a nation of rich swindlers. We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it's true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man's idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments – local, state and federal. He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth Like so many crooked officials, Trump's brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn't – at any given moment, odds are that he's either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/ Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump has to convince people that they can't rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he – as a man who is an expert at cheating – knows how to rig it in your favor: https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/ But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn't actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is actually rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts: https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/ Want to convince people that there's a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there's an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans' houses: https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/ Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren't enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated This is why it's worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don't know what they're talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you're being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it's all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf. Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they're valuable and desirable: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but scientific, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us. In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes up while its value goes down. I mean that literally: say a company that's sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company's capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That's a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it's worth one billion dollars. Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback. What's more, the drop in corporate valuation is more than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company's worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop more than a billion dollars off the company's share price. Instead, it sends the share price up. This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name – just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits. This is categorically untrue. Dividends do take money out of the company's coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure – but a dividend is a bet on the company's future success, which is why a company's share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company's stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations. But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn't afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year's blockbuster book. That dividend would not send investors chasing the company's stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won't have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets. Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up. In other words: when a company's stock price rises on news of a dividend, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's management and its future growth. When a company's stock price rises on news of a buyback, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's future looting to the point of collapse. I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I've been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff's book The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, and I've learned even more scummy truths about buybacks: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay half the tax on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth. It's worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital losses. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you've made. But you don't even have to sell the stock to realize tax-free income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid all taxes. Here's how that works: if you're sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you're smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is tax-deductible. If you're rich enough, you don't have to make regular payments on the loan, either – you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it's due, you borrow even more money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan. That's \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here's \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid all capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets. Now, maybe you're thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I've got bad news for you: you won't qualify for one of those cool loans that you don't need to pay regularly! What's more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), that is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay. Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get much richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don't benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can't spend when rich people don't pay taxes. This is why buybacks have apologists. Buybacks – a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory – make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name. It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people: https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/ It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises: https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/ The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" – literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway's founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway Trump's right: the system is rigged. If you're going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can't insist – as Hillary Clinton did – that \"America is already great\": https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078 America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it's not enough to know that the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know how it is rigged and who rigged it.

    "title": "Human Risk Management: Das Paradoxon der Sicherheitsschulungen",
    "summary": "Security Awareness Trainings sollten auf dem Human-Risk-Management-Ansatz basieren. FAMILY STOCK – shutterstock.com Unternehmen investieren Millionen von Dollar in Firewalls, Endpunktsicherheit oder Verschlüsselung. Doch eine einzige Person kann eine Katastrophe auslösen. Es reicht, wenn sie eine infizierte Datei herunterlädt oder auf einen betrügerischen Link klickt. Analysen zeigen: Zwischen 70 und 90 Prozent aller Sicherheitslücken entstehen, weil Menschen Fehler machen. Sie fallen auf Social Engineering herein oder nutzen riskante Dienste ohne Erlaubnis der IT. Zudem verschärft sich die Lage, da Angreifer zunehmend künstliche Intelligenz und Deepfakes einsetzen. Das Problem ist bekannt. Deshalb gaben Organisationen im Jahr 2025 etwa sechs Milliarden Dollar für Security Awareness Trainings (SAT) aus. Manche Firmen tun dies freiwillig. Die meisten beugen sich jedoch Vorschriften wie der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung oder dem Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Letzterer verpflichtet etwa alle Beschäftigten im Gesundheitswesen rechtlich zu solchen Programmen. Experten erwarten, dass die Ausgaben für diese Maßnahmen jährlich um 15 Prozent steigen. Warum das klassische Training scheitert Obwohl diese Schulungen zum Standard gehören, bleibt ihr Nutzen fragwürdig. Viele Firmen haken das Thema nur ab, um Regeln einzuhalten. Den eigentlichen Mehrwert ignorieren sie dabei. Die Angestellten wiederum spielen das Spiel mit. Sie klicken sich so schnell wie möglich durch die Tutorials, damit sie weiterarbeiten können. Selbst wer aufpasst, vergisst das Gelernte oft schnell wieder, wenn er es im Alltag nicht aktiv anwendet. Manchmal schaden die Kurse sogar. Studien belegen: Wer in den Tests besonders gut abschneidet, wird oft leichtsinnig. Diese Personen wiegen sich in falscher Sicherheit. Meiner Meinung nach stecken wir in einem Paradoxon. Trotz hoher Investitionen und strenger Regeln bleibt der Nutzen minimal. Das System ist defekt. Wir brauchen deshalb einen radikalen Kurswechsel: weg von sporadischen Kursen, hin zum Human Risk Management. Was bedeutet Human Risk Management? Dieser Ansatz verfolgt eine klare Strategie: Er identifiziert menschliches Verhalten als Risiko und versucht, dieses gezielt zu senken. Während herkömmliche Schulungen nur theoretisches Wissen vermitteln, konzentriert sich das Human Risk Management darauf, wie Menschen tatsächlich handeln. Das System verbindet sich direkt mit E-Mail-Programmen oder Identitäts-Management-Systemen. So erkennt es menschliche Schwachstellen sofort. Es nutzt Daten, um riskante Nutzer aufzuspüren. Danach greift es gezielt ein – etwa durch kurze Lerneinheiten oder automatisierte Kontrollen. Am Ende überwacht das System, ob sich das Verhalten wirklich verbessert. Manche glauben, man müsse für beides separat bezahlen. Das stimmt nicht. Tatsächlich sind führende HRM-Lösungen von Anbietern wie Fable Security, KnowBe4 und Mimecast vollgepackt mit Standard-SAT-Material. Sie bieten sogar spezifische Schulungsunterstützung für regulatorische Compliance-Anforderungen. Lesetipp: Menschenzentrierte Cybersicherheit gewinnt an Bedeutung Demokratisierung durch künstliche Intelligenz Klingt das nach neuem Marketing-Hype? Vielleicht. Aber diese Methode nutzt künstliche Intelligenz als Partner. Anders als bei vielen Trends sind sich Experten hier einig: KI wird die Bildung grundlegend verändern. KI agiert wie ein persönlicher Tutor. Sie gibt kleine Stöße in die richtige Richtung. Klickt jemand auf einen gefährlichen Link, erhält er sofort eine passende Lerneinheit. So verfestigt sich das richtige Verhalten im Moment des Fehlers. Zudem lernt das System, wie einzelne Personen am besten begreifen. Die eine Person liest lieber Texte, die andere schaut lieber Videos. Die Werkzeuge können sogar Rollenspiele durchführen und den Wettbewerb unter Kollegen anspornen. Das demokratisiert Expertenwissen auf eine völlig neue Weise. Für Unternehmen lohnt sich das finanziell. Verantwortliche berichten nicht mehr nur, wie viele Leute ein Video geschaut haben. Sie belegen stattdessen, wie sich die digitale Hygiene im Betrieb verbessert. Wer ständig Fehler macht, bekommt individuelle Hilfe. So lässt sich direkt nachweisen, dass das Training die Zahl der echten Sicherheitsvorfälle senkt. Aristoteles sagte einmal: „Wir sind das, was wir wiederholt tun. Vorzüglichkeit ist also keine Handlung, sondern eine Gewohnheit.“ Genau hier setzt das Human Risk Management an. Es verändert Gewohnheiten. Wäre Aristoteles heute Sicherheitschef, würde er diesen logischen Schritt sicher befürworten. (jm)",

    "title": "What’s New in Tenable Cloud Security: Multi-cloud Risk Analysis, Attack Surface Assessments, Improved IAM Security and More",
    "summary": "Tenable Cloud Security continues to expand the technical depth of our Tenable One exposure management platform. Our latest enhancements include unified multi-cloud exploration, high-fidelity network validation, and expanded entitlement visibility across infrastructure and identity providers. Key takeaways Graph-based multi-cloud exploration: We’ve leveraged our unified data model to provide deep visibility across all cloud environments. You can now easily explore cloud risks and resources using an advanced query builder to build and save queries, and switch to Graph view to instantly visualize complex asset relationships and blast radius. Outside-In network attack surface validation: A new external network scanner probes environments to confirm reachability, allowing teams to prioritize vulnerability mitigation based on verifiable external exposure Comprehensive identity inventory: We’ve expanded our identity inventory to unify entitlement tracking across cloud platforms, including Microsoft Entra ID and Google Workspace. This allows teams to instantly pinpoint overprivileged roles and unused policies to enforce least privilege at scale. Explorer: Unified query and relationship mapping Fragmentation of data across disconnected tools is a primary hurdle in multi-cloud security, often forcing teams to pivot between siloed views to find context. To address this, we have introduced Explorer, a unified interface for deep-dive analysis into resources and findings across your cloud estate. This capability moves beyond static views, allowing security teams to precisely identify risk by querying across objects using granular filters, logical operators, and relationship-based joins. With the Explorer, you can: Perform complex correlations: Use advanced query logic and joins to connect disparate data points, such as linking specific vulnerabilities to their underlying cloud identities or identifying storage buckets that contain sensitive data and are being used for training by AI models. Streamline operations: Leverage saved query configurations to standardize repetitive auditing tasks and ensure consistency across compliance reviews. Visualize the blast radius: Utilize the Graph view to map asset dependencies, providing a clear visual understanding of how vulnerabilities can propagate through your environment. The Explorer unifies multi-cloud resources into a single interface, allowing teams to query complex asset relationships and instantly visualize the potential blast radius via Graph view. Network security: High-fidelity exposure validation To improve prioritization accuracy, we have enhanced Tenable’s network scanner to perform outside-in probing of your cloud environments' attack surface. Rather than relying solely on static cloud configuration analysis of publicly exposed cloud resources – which can often lead to false positives — this tool conducts an external reachability analysis to confirm whether an endpoint is actually accessible from the internet. By validating real-world exposure, security teams can filter out noise and surface the small percentage of vulnerabilities that pose a genuine external threat. To translate this validation into action, you can now filter exposed network endpoints by resource type (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and databases), specific ports, host IPs, and other properties. This granularity makes it easier to isolate specific segments of your infrastructure and accelerate targeted remediation of your most critical external exposures. The Tenable network scanner actively verifies external reachability to confirm internet-exposed workloads IAM security: Expanded entitlement visibility and insight Managing identity risk requires deep visibility into both cloud infrastructure and identity providers (IdPs). We have expanded our cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) capabilities to provide a comprehensive inventory of entitlements across AWS, Azure, GCP, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace. The Inventory view now displays all roles and identity-based policies—regardless of whether they are currently active. This technical baseline is essential for identifying \"ghost\" identities and stale permissions that increase the attack surface. Furthermore, administrators can now define custom security policies for any role category, including those not yet deployed in the environment. This enables the establishment of proactive governance and least-privilege guardrails that scale automatically as new resources are provisioned. Comprehensive posture: Public AMI scanning Our AWS coverage now includes support for public Amazon Machine Image (AMI) scanning. This allows organizations to assess the security posture of vendor-provided and AWS-published images within their own environment. By analyzing these images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, teams can mitigate supply chain risks before they are integrated into production workloads. Audit-vendor and AWS-published images in your posture assessments to mitigate supply chain risk Guided use cases: Solve real problems, fast This month, we’ve added two high-impact use-case packages to help you build an exposure management foundation: Prioritize cloud risk that matters most . Use AI-Powered VPR and toxic combination analysis to cut through the noise, reducing remediation time by 80%. See a demo . Secure AI workloads . Discover and protect sensitive data powering AI workloads while continuously assessing the underlying AI infrastructure and configurations. Learn more by reading a solution overview . Advance your security maturity Maturing a cloud security program requires a shift from managing individual findings to understanding functional resilience. By unifying visibility, validating network reachability, and auditing identity, organizations build the foundation to manage exposure at scale. Tenable Cloud Security is the critical pillar of the Tenable One exposure management platform that provides these comprehensive CNAPP capabilities. Reflecting the real-world value delivered to users, Tenable was recently recognized as a 2025 Customers’ Choice in the Gartner® Peer Insights™ 'Voice of the Customer': Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). Frequently Asked Questions Which identity platforms are now included in the expanded inventory? Coverage has expanded beyond standard cloud providers to include Microsoft Entra ID and Google Workspace, providing visibility into the full \"identity-to-data\" path. What is the primary technical advantage of the Explorer Graph view? It replaces isolated alerts with a visual map of asset relationships, helping teams visualize how a single vulnerability could impact adjacent resources. How does the network scanner differ from standard configuration checks? It actively probes the environment from an external perspective to confirm service reachability – assessing exposure more accurately than static code analysis alone. Why scan public AMIs? This ensures that third-party images, often used as base layers for workloads, are audited for vulnerabilities within the context of your specific security requirements. Learn more: What is CTEM?

    "title": "How risk culture turns cyber teams predictive",
    "summary": "The first time you’ll hear, “We’re always in incident mode,” it won’t be said with drama. It will be said the way you mention the weather. Grey again. Pager again. And that’s the problem. When a constant alarm becomes normal, your team stops asking the only question that matters. Why do we keep ending up here? You can buy more tools. You can hire more analysts. You can hang more dashboards. You’ll still end up sprinting after the last breach, the last misconfiguration, the last vendor surprise, the last “minor” change that ate your weekend. The best cyber teams we’ve worked with didn’t win because they ran faster. They won because they were adaptive and changed the risk landscape. They built a culture where weak signals had a microphone, and action didn’t require heroics. Forecasting in cybersecurity is not fortune-telling. It’s disciplined habits, clear choices and a team that treats risk as daily practice, not an annual slide. The trap: When ‘busy’ replaces ‘aware’ Reactive teams don’t choose chaos. Chaos chooses them, one small compromise at a time. A rushed change goes in late Friday. A privileged account sticks around “temporarily” for months. A patch slips because the product has a deadline, and security feels like the polite guest at the table. A supplier gets fast-tracked, and nobody circles back. Each event seems manageable. Together, they create a pattern. The pattern is what burns you. Most teams drown in noise because they treat every alert as equal and security’s job. You never develop direction. You develop reflexes. Reflexes feel useful. They look good on incident bridges. They can also keep you blind. Forecasting begins when you stop rewarding the “save” and start rewarding the “see and act.” Risk culture: What it is when you strip the slogans People talk about culture like it’s soft. Posters. Values. A town hall with applause on cue. Culture is harder. Culture is what people do when nobody is watching, and when the clock is loud. Culture is what gets you the truth at 4 p.m., not at 4 a.m. In cybersecurity, risk culture answers four questions. Do people notice risk early? Do they name it clearly? Do they know who can decide? Do they act without fear? If anyone fails, you get silence. Silence is the most dangerous gap in the building. We’ve seen teams with expensive tooling and miserable outcomes because engineers learned one lesson. “If I raise a risk, I’ll get punished, slowed down or ignored.” So they keep quiet, and you get surprised. We’ve also seen teams with average tooling but strong habits. They didn’t pretend risk was comfortable. They made it speakable. Speakable risk is the start of foresight. Foresight enables the right action or inaction to achieve the best result! Signal discipline: Give weak signals a place to land Forecasting is not about seeing everything. It’s about seeing the right things early enough to act. Top teams collect near misses like pilots collect flight data. Not for blame. For pattern. A near miss is the attacker who almost got in. The bad change that almost made it into production. The vendor who nearly exposed a secret. The credential that nearly shipped in code. Most organizations throw these away. “No harm done.” Ticket closed. Then harm arrives later, wearing the same outfit. So you need a place for near misses to land. A lightweight log. A channel people trust. A small weekly ritual where you ask, “What almost happened?” Not “Who messed up.” You also need shared language. Not ten pages of taxonomy. Just words that mean the same thing across teams. When someone says “critical,” do they mean “drop everything,” or “put it in the next release?” Ambiguity breeds delay. Delay breeds surprise. Decision rights: Speed dies in committees We’ve seen incident calls where 20 people had opinions, and nobody had authority. It’s like watching a committee try to steer a ship mid-storm. Forecasting requires speed, and speed requires decision rights and Risk Intelligence. Many programmes invest in detection and forget the human bottleneck. Even perfect visibility is useless if every decision needs a meeting, and every meeting needs a senior leader who is “in back-to-backs.” Top teams make risk-intelligent decisions before the heat. Who can block a release? Who can isolate a system? Who can force key rotation? Who can accept risk, and under what conditions? When an issue jumps a level, and what triggers that jump. If you want forecasting, fix your approval grid. Make it short. Make it usable at 2 a.m. Then protect it. One override for convenience, and people learn the real rules. The real rules always win. Behavioral standards: What ‘good’ looks like on Tuesday You can’t ask people to “care about risk” and expect it to stick. People run on what gets rewarded and what gets them in trouble. So strong teams set behavioral standards. Not as a lecture. As an operating agreement. Security’s job is to reduce harm while keeping work moving, not to act as a gatekeeper. That means rules people can follow, and guardrails that make the right path easier than the wrong one. Engineering’s job is to own what they ship, not to “help security.” If you build it, you own the blast radius. Product’s job is to make exposure part of design, not to treat security as a late-stage checklist. If you can’t explain why a feature is worth the risk, you don’t understand the feature. Vendor owners have a job too. They can’t outsource supplier risk to a questionnaire. They own the follow-up when a supplier says, “We’ll fix it next quarter.” A small practice I love. Ask each team for three “no surprises” rules. No privileged access without expiry. No production change without rollback. No new vendor without an owner and an exit plan. Short list. Clear verbs. Real enforcement. That’s culture. Operating rhythm: The week is where risk becomes real If you only talk about risk during audits and incidents, you don’t have a culture of risk. You have a seasonal sport. Forecasting lives in cadence. In the meetings you actually attend. Weekly, run a short review with three questions. What changed that affects exposure? What almost went wrong? What needs a decision? Keep it tight. If it turns into status theatre, kill it and start again. Monthly, practice one scenario. Plain, no fancy decks. If ransomware hits this service, what happens in the first hour? Who decides. What do you shut down, and what must stay alive? Quarterly, test what you claim. Backups. Access controls. Vendor escalation. If you can’t test it, you don’t know it. This rhythm teaches people that risk isn’t a surprise visitor. Risk is a resident. You don’t panic when you see it. You deal with it. Imagine you once joined a team’s weekly review as a guest. Ten minutes in, an ops lead said, “We changed the identity provider settings yesterday. It felt odd.” No panic. No blame. Just a raised hand. Security asked two questions, engineering checked logs and they rolled back a risky toggle before lunch. Nothing made the news. Nobody got a medal. Everyone went home on time. That’s what a good rhythm buys you. Most weeks, quietly. Measures that point forward: Count what moves before damage Many dashboards tell you what already happened. Incidents. Downtime. Loss. Useful, but late. If you want forecasting, track measures that move before the mess. Let’s shift to being a little more proactive and presilience-focused, instead of testing our reactions and resilience as the go-to responses. How long do critical patches sit on systems that matter? How often do privileged access exceptions expire on time? How many urgent changes bypass checks, and where? How many near misses get reported, and how fast you learn? Watch a team celebrate fewer incidents while near-miss reporting fell to zero. They thought they improved. In reality, people stopped speaking. Six weeks later, they got hit. The silence was the signal. You don’t want perfect numbers. You want honest trends that trigger choices, not slides. Leadership: The culture you reward is the culture you get Leaders say they want transparency. Then they punish the first person who brings bad news. That one moment teaches the organization more than any policy ever could. If you want forecasting and Presilience, protect the messenger. Praise early escalation. Treat risk as a trade, not as a personal failure. Also, stop romanticising heroics. The midnight save feels good. It makes a great story. It also hides the root issue: poor planning, weak controls, unclear ownership and a habit of postponing boring work. Boring work buys calm, discipline buys reliability but risk intelligence enables the right balance of compliance, resilience and presilience to manifest. Think of board conversations where someone asked, “Why spend on resilience when nothing happened this quarter?” And you answered with a question. “Would you rather pay for brakes or for ambulances?” It landed because it was true. A simple 90-day shift: Small moves, real change If your team feels stuck, don’t start with a massive program. Start with a few moves that change behavior fast. First 30 days. Map your top repeat failures. Pick five signals to watch weekly. Name owners. Days 31 to 60. Fix one decision bottleneck. Write the rule. Use it. Days 61 to 90. Run one scenario practice a month. Learn one thing. Change one playbook. Close one gap. You’re not chasing perfection. You’re building a habit. Habits compound. If you do this well, something shifts. You stop being surprised by the same problems. People raise issues earlier. Engineers stop hiding bad news. Security stops shouting into the void. The organization feels calmer. Not complacent. Calm. That calm is not luck. It’s culture. The right balance between prevention, reaction and proactivity ensures sustainable high performance. And here’s the quiet mic-drop. When risk becomes a daily conversation, you don’t need to guess the future. You stop being shocked by the present. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.

    "title": "Desperate Perth Renters Targeted by Rising Australian Housing Scam",
    "summary": "For many residents in Perth, finding a rental has become a high-stakes challenge. As demand for housing surges, a troubling trend has just been revealed. An Australian housing scam preying on renters who are willing to stretch every dollar to secure a roof over their heads. These rent scams, often orchestrated by individuals posing as private landlords on online platforms like Facebook Marketplace, have left victims financially and emotionally drained. The scheme typically begins with a seemingly genuine rental listing. Scammers steal photos from legitimate properties and post them online, offering rent well below the market rate. In Perth, median rental prices are at historic highs, with houses averaging $700 per week and units $670. Scammers exploit this stress by pitching “exclusive” opportunities that seem almost too good to be true. The Mechanics of the Australian Housing Scam Messages from these fraudsters are carefully crafted to manipulate potential tenants. One such message promises that the apartment will be “reserved exclusively only for you” in exchange for a security deposit or “commitment fee” of just a few hundred dollars. The deposit is presented as fully refundable or deductible from the first week’s rent. In reality, once the money is transferred, the scammer vanishes, leaving victims without the property and out of pocket. WA Commissioner for Consumer Protection, Trish Blake, describes the situation as a “perfect playground for scammers.” She explains that the perpetrators often groom their targets by appealing to their sense of urgency and personal integrity, portraying themselves as allies to those struggling in the rental market. “They’ll tell you that you’re a real battler, that you’re a good person, and that they want to help you out,” Blake said, as reported by Nine News . Rising Numbers and Financial Impact The scale of the problem is growing. In 2025, WA ScamNet, part of the Department of Local Government, Industry Regulation and Safety, documented 20 cases of rental scams, totaling losses of $51,875, a 27 percent increase from the previous year. Scammers typically provide a property address for drive-by inspections but evade any requests for in-person viewings. To add credibility, fake rental agreements featuring official logos may be used, and tenants are pressured to pay via bank transfer, bypassing safer, traceable channels. Rob Mandanici, a member of the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia, stresses the emotional pressure on renters. “People have pure desperation, and they will do what they can for their family, thinking they’re doing the right thing while potentially dealing with unsavoury characters,” he said. Commerce Minister Dr. Tony Buti noted the heartbreak of seeing renters targeted in this way. “It is particularly heartbreaking to see scammers targeting renters because they know they are under pressure and may take risks to secure a property,” he said. He advises tenants to insist on inspecting the property in person and to treat unusually cheap rent as a red flag. Why Perth Is Vulnerable to Housing and Rent Scams Several factors make Perth an ideal environment for this type of Australian housing scam. Rental vacancies are low, demand is high, and properties are snatched quickly, often in as little as 16 days. This scarcity creates a sense of urgency among renters, which scammers exploit. The Cook Government has issued repeated warnings to Western Australian tenants to remain vigilant, especially when dealing with private landlords or online marketplaces. Inspecting the property before paying, verifying the landlord’s identity, and consulting licensed real estate agents are critical protection methods. Several practical tips to avoid falling victim to rental scams include: Be suspicious of properties advertised for well below market rent. Do not rely solely on photos; perform reverse image searches to verify authenticity. Check the property on reputable real estate websites and contact previous listing agents. Avoid landlords or listings that use the same email address for multiple properties. Always inspect the property in person before signing a lease or paying funds. Ensure a formal lease agreement (Form 1AA) and keys are provided before transferring any money. Be cautious with direct bank transfers; only pay verified landlords or licensed agents. Scams can be reported through the WA ScamNet website, or further guidance on rent is available via the Consumer Protection website. The Australian housing scam in Perth is more than a financial threat; it exploits human vulnerability in a market under immense pressure. Renters finding high prices and fierce competition must combine caution with diligence, balancing urgency with verification. While there is no substitute for careful vetting, awareness and education remain the most effective defense against campaigns like the Australian housing scam.

    "title": "This stealthy Windows RAT holds live conversations with its operators",
    "summary": "Security researchers at Point Wild have disclosed a new Windows malware campaign that uses a multi-stage infection chain to establish persistent, memory-resident access on compromised systems and steal sensitive data. The analysis found the malware relying on standard Windows components for execution and persistence, limiting the number of artifacts written to disk. The activity, analyzed by the company’s Lat61 team, involves a .NET-based, modular remote access trojan (Pulsar RAT) that supports live, interactive operator control. The malware’s reliance on in-memory execution and living-off-the-land techniques limits the effectiveness of file-based detection tools, the researchers noted in a blog post. “The malware exhibits advanced anti-analysis techniques, including anti-VM, anti-debugging, and process injection detection, alongside extensive credential harvesting, surveillance capabilities, and remote system control,” they said. “Stolen data is exfiltrated as ZIP archives over Discord webhooks and Telegram bots.” Initial access and memory-resident execution The infection chain begins with a small batch script that establishes persistence through a per-user Registry Run key. Rather than deploying a full executable, the script launches a PowerShell-based loader , reducing the likelihood of immediate detection by traditional endpoint security tools. This PowerShell loader decodes and executes shellcode generated using Donut , an open-source framework commonly used to convert. NET assemblies into position-independent shellcode. The shellcode injects the payload directly into memory, avoiding the need to write a portable executable to disk. By operating entirely in memory after initial execution, the malware limits the effectiveness of file-based scanning and static analysis. Point Wild researchers noted that the attack blending into normal Windows activity calls for behavioral or memory-focused telemetry. Once loaded, the malware deploys a heavily obfuscated .NET component that serves as the core execution framework for the operation. RAT capabilities and stealer functionality The .NET payload implements a remote access trojan that allows operators to interact directly with compromised systems. Unlike many commodity RATs that rely on periodic check-ins, this malware supports live command handling, enabling attackers to issue instructions and receive responses in near real-time. This interactive design allows operators to perform reconnaissance, manipulate files, execute commands, and manage persistence dynamically based on what they observe on the infected host. Alongside the RAT functionality, the malware includes an information-stealing component that collects sensitive system data. While the disclosure did not attribute the Stealer to a specific malware family, the researchers noted that it operates in parallel with the RAT, allowing data collection to continue while operators actively engage with the system. Persistence, evasion, and mitigation Persistence is maintained through Registry-based autorun entries and reinforced by the malware’s ability to re-establish execution if disrupted. The use of obfuscation across the .NET payload further complicates reverse engineering and slows analysis. Point Wild emphasized that the campaign’s effectiveness stems from disciplined execution of Living-off-the-land binaries, in-memory payloads, and obfuscated managed code. Together, they make detection difficult. The researchers noted that detecting the activity requires monitoring process and memory behavior rather than relying on file-based indicators, which include watching for suspicious PowerShell execution, shellcode injection into running processes, and suspicious persistence via Registry Run keys. Rapid host isolation and live response were emphasized to contain interactive activity and limit data theft once a compromise is suspected.",

    "title": "Why non-human identities are your biggest security blind spot in 2026",
    "summary": "Last month, while running a routine access audit on our Azure environment, I came across a service account called svc-dataloader-poc. It had not been touched in 793 days — two years of sitting dormant. When I checked its permissions, my stomach dropped: Owner-level access to three production subscriptions, including our customer database. The account had been spun up for a proof-of-concept migration that never went live. The contractor who created it left 18 months ago. Nobody knew it existed. This was not a one-off. I found 47 similar accounts in that same audit. Forty-seven doors left wide open. Here is the uncomfortable reality facing every security leader in 2026: while we spent the last decade perfecting MFA rollouts and zero-trust architectures for our human users, something else was quietly multiplying across our environments. Service accounts. API keys. Automation credentials. AI agents. These non-human identities now outnumber actual employees in most enterprises by ratios that would have seemed absurd five years ago. ManageEngine’s 2026 Identity Security Outlook found that organisations reported machine-to-human ratios of 100:1; some hit 500:1. And the vast majority of these identities sit completely outside our governance programmes. We locked the front door. The back door has been open this whole time. Why the NHI explosion is different this time Machine identities are not new. What changed is the velocity. Five years ago, a typical enterprise application was a monolith talking to a database. Today, that same application is 50 microservices, each needing credentials to talk to the others. Every Kubernetes pod that spins up during auto-scaling creates workload identities. Every GitHub Actions workflow generates tokens. Every Terraform run provisions service principals. I watched a single deployment pipeline create more machine identities in 20 minutes than our entire company had human users. Then came agentic AI, and the problem accelerated again. These are not chatbots answering questions. They are systems authorised to execute commands, move production data, modify configurations and trigger downstream workflows autonomously. Microsoft Copilot has access to your SharePoint. GitHub Copilot can commit to your repos. The AI assistant your marketing team just deployed can pull customer records from Salesforce. One Identity is predicting 2026 will see the first major breach traced back to an over-privileged AI agent. The terrifying part? It will not look like an attack. It will look exactly like the system doing what it was designed to do. Our IAM systems were never built for this. They assume identities belong to people with managers who respond to access review emails and eventually resign or retire. Machine identities have no manager. They never respond to certification campaigns. They do not quit. The OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10 ranks improper offboarding as the number one risk. When a project gets cancelled, when a vendor integration gets deprecated, when a developer leaves — does anyone remember to delete the service accounts? In my experience running IAM programmes across multiple organisations, the answer is almost never. The three blind spots I keep finding After years working in cloud security and identity management, certain patterns show up everywhere I look. Three problems in particular appear in nearly every environment I assess. Secrets where they should never be. I still find API keys hardcoded in source files. Still. In 2026. Last year, GitGuardian detected 13 million secrets exposed in public GitHub repositories. Google API keys, MongoDB credentials, AWS access keys — sitting in plaintext for anyone to harvest. But the public repos are not even the biggest problem. In my own assessments, I have found production database passwords in Jira tickets, Slack messages, Confluence runbooks and shared Google Docs. A colleague once discovered an admin token for a payment gateway pasted into a Teams chat from 2023, still valid, still granting full access. Once secrets escape into collaboration tools, you have lost control. They get copied, forwarded, indexed, archived. They never truly disappear. Service accounts with absurd privilege levels. This one makes me angry because it is so preventable. A developer needs a service account for a new Lambda function. They are under deadline pressure. Figuring out the exact minimum permissions takes time, so they attach AdministratorAccess and move on. The function works. Nobody revisits it. That account now has god-mode access to your entire AWS environment for a task that needed read access to one S3 bucket. Multiply this across every team, every sprint, every year. The 2025 State of Non-Human Identities report from Entro Security found 97% of NHIs have excessive privileges. Ninety-seven percent. Even more alarming: just 0.01% of machine identities control 80% of cloud resources. Compromise one of those accounts and the attacker owns your environment. No lifecycle ownership whatsoever. When an employee leaves, HR triggers offboarding. Access gets revoked. There is a process. When a service account is no longer needed, what happens? Nothing. It sits there. I routinely find accounts untouched for six months, twelve months, sometimes three years — all still holding production access. Veza’s research found dormant accounts nearly doubled year over year. Orphaned identities grew 40%. Former employees — 78,000 of them in one dataset — still had active credentials because HR systems flagged them as inactive but nobody revoked their service accounts. These are not theoretical vulnerabilities. These are live credentials waiting for someone to find them. A practical path forward for security leaders Acknowledging the problem is step one. Fixing it requires treating machine identities with the same governance discipline we finally learned to apply to human users. Based on what I have seen actually work, here is where I would focus. Build a real inventory. You cannot protect what you cannot see. Before anything else, discover every non-human identity in your environment. Every service account across your cloud platforms. Every API key in your applications. Every secret in your vaults, config files, CI/CD pipelines. Every third-party integration with access to your systems. Most organisations I work with drastically underestimate their footprint. The actual number is typically three to five times what teams expect. This cannot be a manual exercise or an annual audit. Identities are created faster than humans can count them. Automate discovery and make it continuous. Enforce least privilege without exceptions. Every NHI needs to be scoped to the minimum access required for its function. Yes, this takes work. Yes, developers will push back. Do it anyway. Start with new deployments and make least privilege the default from day one. For existing accounts, compare assigned permissions against actual usage patterns. You will find plenty of accounts with broad access that only ever touch one or two resources. Those are quick wins. Require security approval before any NHI gets elevated privileges. Make it a gate, not a suggestion. Eliminate static credentials wherever possible. Long-lived secrets are the root cause behind most NHI breaches. The goal should be eliminating them entirely. Replace permanent API keys with short-lived tokens that expire automatically. Implement just-in-time access that grants permissions for a specific task and revokes them immediately after. Automate credential rotation on a defined schedule — weekly, daily, even hourly for sensitive systems. Research shows 71% of non-human identities are not rotated within recommended timeframes. Every day a credential sits unchanged is another day an attacker could be using it without detection. The security industry is converging on a clear consensus for 2026: machine identities will become the primary breach vector in cloud environments. Tenable predicts it. Delinea predicts it. One Identity predicts it. Attackers already know that compromising a service account is often easier and quieter than targeting humans. They are not breaking down doors anymore. They are walking through the ones we forgot to lock. The organisations that get ahead of this threat will be the ones treating their non-human identities with the same seriousness they apply to their executive accounts. Full visibility. Strict governance. No exceptions. The ones who keep treating NHIs as an afterthought will be the ones explaining to their boards how a forgotten service account from a cancelled project brought down the house. We locked the front door years ago. It has been a long time since we secured the back. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network. Want to join?",

    "title": "TLS 1.3 in SQL Server 2025: What It Really Changes for Security",
    "summary": "Why TLS 1.3 matters TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that encrypts traffic between clients and servers. For many years, most SQL Server environments have relied on TLS 1.2, which dates back to 2008. TLS 1.3, finalized in 2018, is a significant evolution. It brings three main benefits: Better performance With fewer roundtrips and faster negotiation, secure connections are established much more quickly in practice Stronger security Old and weak algorithms are removed (RC4, SHA1, MD5, DES, 3DES…) Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is mandatory. Even if a private key is compromised later, past sessions remain protected Simpler cipher suites: less configuration complexity, fewer chances to misconfigure Easier compliance Recommended by NIST Strongly encouraged by PCIDSS 4.0 Fewer exceptions to justify during audits What SQL Server 2025 adds SQL Server 2022 introduced TLS 1.3 through the new TDS 8.0 (Tabular Data Stream) protocol. And SQL Server 2025 makes it broadly usable across the SQL Server ecosystem, this is not limited to client connections only. Components that can use TLS 1.3 Client connections (ODBC, OLE DB, .NET) SQL Server Agent bcp utility sqlcmd utility Always On Availability Groups Always On Failover Cluster Instances Log Shipping Transactional replication Merge replication Peer-to-peer replication Snapshot replication Linked Servers PolyBase SQL Writer Service Prerequisites Valid certificates on all endpoints Selfsigned certificates are acceptable for testing In production, use certificates from a trusted CA or an internal PKI Updated drivers ODBC Driver 18+ for SQL Server OLE DB Driver 19+ for SQL Server Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 5.0+ Older drivers will either fall back to older TLS versions or fail to connect SQL Server configuration You can enforce encryption on all connections (Force Encryption) You can configure TDS 8.0 as the minimum protocol version (Force Strict Encryption) How Copilot can help I'm setting up log shipping between two SQL Server 2025 instances with TLS 1.3 enabled. What certificate requirements should I verify ? The MSSQL extension with GitHub Copilot can assist you when planning and rolling out TLS 1.3. Auditing the current state Analyze my current SQL Server encryption configuration. What TLS version are my connections using ? Are there any connections using deprecated protocols ? Copilot can generate and explain the queries that inspect the relevant DMVs and interpret the results. Generating configuration scripts Generate a script to configure SQL Server 2025 to require TLS 1.3 for all incoming connections, including the certificate configuration steps. Diagnosing compatibility issues My application fails to connect after enabling TDS 8.0. The error mentions \"SSL Provider\". What should I check and how do I fix it ? Reviewing linked servers Review my linked server configurations and identify which onesmight have issues with TLS 1.3 requirements. Documenting the changes Generate documentation for our security team explainingthe TLS configuration changes we're implementing for PCI-DSS compliance. It is possible that the AI generated content is incorrect. You remain responsible for reviewing, validating, and approving it before any use. Do not rely on this output without thorough human verification. Not intended for production use. Things to watch out for Linked Servers to legacy systems You may have linked servers that point to: Older SQL Server versions (2016 and earlier) ODBC sources that do not support TLS 1.2/1.3 Thirdparty servers with outdated TLS stacks If you enforce TLS 1.3 everywhere, these connections can fail. Possible approaches: Upgrade the remote systems Use temporary exceptions (not recommended longterm in production) Introduce a proxy or gateway that can handle protocol translation Replication to older versions Transactional or merge replication to subscribers running SQL Server 2019 or earlier may require mixed configurations. Legacy applications Applications using: .NET Framework with older System.Data.SqlClient versions Old ODBC/OLE DB drivers Thirdparty tools that are not updated may need to be upgraded or reconfigured before you enforce TLS 1.3. Suggested deployment strategy These steps are indicative; adapt them to your environment and change management process. Phase 1: Audit Inventory all inbound and outbound connections Identify client types and driver versions Document linked servers and replication paths Phase 2: Testing Enable TLS 1.3 in a staging or preproduction environment Test all critical applications and administrative tools Identify and resolve compatibility issues Phase 3: Progressive rollout Enable TLS 1.3 as an option without forcing it Monitor which connections still negotiate older TLS versions Once all key systems are compatible, enforce TLS 1.3 References TDS 8.0 - SQL Server Configure TLS 1.3 on SQL Server 2022 and later - SQL Server Encrypt Connections by Importing a Certificate - SQL Server Database Engine: Breaking Changes - SQL Server 2025 Certificate Requirements for SQL Server - SQL Server",

    "summary": "Segment 1: Interview with Warwick Webb From Initial Entry to Resilience: Understanding Modern Attack Flows Modern cyberattacks don't unfold as isolated alerts--they move as coordinated attack flows that exploit gaps between tools, teams, and time. In this episode, Warwick Webb, Vice President of Managed Detection and Response at SentinelOne, breaks down how today's breaches often begin invisibly, progress undetected through siloed security stacks, and accelerate faster than human response alone can handle. He'll discuss how unified platforms, machine-speed detection powered by global threat intelligence, and expert-led response change the equation--turning fragmented signals into clear attack narratives. The conversation concludes with how organizations can move beyond incident response to build resilience, readiness, and continuous improvement through post-attack analysis. Listeners will leave with a clearer understanding of how attacks actually unfold in the real world—and what it takes to move from reactive alert handling to true attack-flow-driven defense.

BMI/ Laurin Schmid Deutschland und Israel haben nach Angaben des Bundesinnenministeriums erstmals gemeinsam die Abwehr eines schweren Cyberangriffs trainiert. Die Übung mit dem Namen “Blue Horizon” war demnach der erste konkrete Schritt aus dem Cyber- und Sicherheitspakt, den Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) und Israels Ministerpräsident Benjamin Netanjahu kürzlich vereinbart hatten. “Cyberdome” soll vor Angriffen schützen Der Pakt sieht unter anderem eine enge Vernetzung der Sicherheitsbehörden beider Länder sowie eine noch engere Kooperation in den Bereichen Cyberkriminalität, Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und Drohnenabwehr vor. Bei der Übung sollten sich Experten beider Seiten laut Innenministerium besser kennenlernen. Kern der Zusammenarbeit ist demnach der Aufbau eines deutschen “Cyberdomes”, angelehnt an das israelische Modell. Israel hat Erfahrung mit Cyberangriffen Der “Cyberdome” ist israelischen Angaben zufolge ein Verteidigungssystem, das unterschiedliche Daten zusammenführt und mit Hilfe von Künstlicher Intelligenz Schwachstellen oder auch Bedrohungen im Netz erkennt. Organisationen können auf diese Weise frühzeitig vor möglichen Hackerangriffen gewarnt werden. Israel gilt als Vorreiter im Bereich Cybersicherheit. Die oftmals iranischen Cyberattacken zielen Experten zufolge darauf, Israels Infrastruktur zu sabotieren, Daten zu sammeln sowie Falschnachrichten zu verbreiten. Israel arbeitet mit mehreren Verbündeten zusammen, um solche Angriffe abzuwehren. (dpa/jm)",

    "title": "CSO Barry Hensley on staying a step ahead of the cyber threat landscape",
    "summary": "IT security was a critical element of retired US Col. Barry Hensley’s 24-year military career as an Army Signal Officer, as he was often responsible for the engineering and installation of “military networks, whether in garrison or in support of combat troops deployed.” “The pinnacle of my military career was working with an elite group of cyber forces with the ultimate mission to operate and defend the military’s global communications network,” Hensley tells CSO. “It was during this period that I realized the severity of cybersecurity issues facing this [US] nation, and I wanted to commit my professional career to be part of the solution while continuing to fight the good fight.” Today, Hensley is the CSO of Brown & Brown, a global insurance brokerage, with the goal to help clients safeguard what matters most to them. CSO spoke to Barry Hensley about cybersecurity in the insurance industry, how to keep cyber professionals inspired, and more. How do organizations today perceive cybersecurity? Hensley: The awareness of cybersecurity risks is more consistent across industry today; but the degree of required call to action often varies greatly. Cybersecurity is foundational to any organization, especially where customer confidence and trust are essential. And part of that trust includes the security of the networks, the data, and the services we provide. It was not that long ago that organizations did not believe the risks were real or relevant to them. Times have changed as more organizations have either experienced a significant incident firsthand or have seen enough third- and fourth-party breach notifications to take up arms. All these events drive awareness and give credibility to the threats and associated risks. However, there is still a challenge in establishing an appropriate risk tolerance that drives the right investments in effective security controls, especially for budget constrained organizations. We also cannot forget the rise of government intervention and fines and other regulatory actions related to cybersecurity events that will influence those perceptions. What specific security risks are you facing in the insurance industry today? Threat actors today have a common theme, and that’s how they capitalize on their access. So, personally, I do not over-index on the vertical specific threats; it’s really about the data or access those organizations possess and its perceived value. Specific to the insurance industry, there may be information collected to inform a claim or policy that a threat actor might determine valuable even if it only refines their targeting efforts of others. However, we also cannot wish away the “idealist” or “ideologically motivated” threat actors that target the insurance industry because of historical misconceptions or animosity toward the industry. Specific to ransomware, threat actors are likely to target organizations that have a high likelihood of paying or be exploited. So, it’s as much about the data those organizations possess, not necessarily the industry verticals themselves, and the maturity of their security program. Threat actors want to expend the least number of resources for the highest return on investment, so they often target low-hanging fruit, which are, in many cases, the least mature security programs. Do you see your cybersecurity strategy changing in the next few years? Our strategy remains the same: focused security investments aligned to our risk tolerance, staying a step ahead of an increasingly active threat landscape. An example is the adoption of artificial intelligence hacking tools, clearly an illustration of the need to adapt. The question is, How do our security teams combat this advancement with our own AI strategy? How do we leverage AI to carry out those commodity tasks while unleashing our human teammates to focus on business context as it relates to the overall risk reduction and prioritization of training those AI models? So, imagine an AI security workforce that is led by human security subject-matter experts ensuring we have appropriate defenses at the right time and right place. An example would be conducting continuous penetration testing to find the gaps in our defenses that might otherwise go unnoticed. We do see the evolution of third- and fourth-party risk management, especially in how we validate our security partner’s maturity and resilience. The evolution of risk is partly based on third and fourth parties swapping their underlying technologies to reduce cost or increase efficiencies that a customer has little to no understanding of the risks that might expose. So, for the security functions we’re going to provide internally, we’ll focus on the basics and do them well. With the controls/functions we outsource, we must reimagine not only how we verify our partner environments but how do we actively participate to improve their security programs as well as ours. We cannot forget that much of cybersecurity is about doing the basics brilliantly. And in this case, those basics of building and securing an infrastructure that will still be leveraged for years to come. What do you do to retain cybersecurity professionals? Leadership is about how you inspire people to achieve or accomplish a shared vision beyond what they ever expected they could do. Leaders must first understand teammates’ passions and relevant skills to align them to achieve business goals . Getting their buy-in is key while clearly articulating where they fit in the overall vision. At Brown & Brown, we help others protect what is most valuable to them. To retain our top talent, we make sure our teammates understand where they fit into that mission. Our success story is based upon earning people’s business every day, and ensuring that our environment, networks, and data are secure is critical to building and retaining that trust. We need to demonstrate to our teammates just how integral they are to maintaining that trust in our customer relationships. We want them to wake up every day knowing that they play an important role not only in our security program, but also the broader Brown & Brown ecosystem. At Brown & Brown, we put the teammate first, as their expertise will always be a key differentiator. What are you most proud of? I am most proud of the inspiring team of security professionals that I work with each day. They always put the team before themselves, strive to be the very best at what they do, and always go the extra mile to ensure the security and protection of their teammates and the organization. I am truly blessed to be part of an amazing team whose work ethic and commitment to excellence are unparalleled in my experience. Are there any questions CISOs should be asking themselves? Are we assessing the most relevant risks, rather than the risks of yesterday? And, because we can get so wrapped up in the playbook that we ran in our last organization, how do we ensure the current playbook is relevant to the organization at hand? An example would be how much time we focus on phishing training, which burdens our teammates to be the first line of defense, where we could instead leverage anomaly-based detection to automate the detection and response actions. What are the biggest security challenges cybersecurity leaders are facing right now? Hensley: In this business, there is no single biggest challenge, but multiple, ever-evolving challenges that compete for our attention. A shared challenge across the entire cybersecurity community is having to be right 100% of the time in a world where threat actors are so agile, innovative, well-resourced, and advantaged with the element of surprise. Cybersecurity professionals also struggle with prioritizing their efforts while providing innovative solutions for their enterprises. Every cybersecurity leader must wrestle with the risks posed by new technologies; AI being just one of many. While there is no absolute “right” answer to the risk question, the age-old formula of mitigating threats against your most critical assets holds firm. Security teams have an ongoing mission to identify weaknesses, assess the likelihood of exploitation, and determine the resulting impact on the business. It’s a difficult but necessary step in the risk versus reward trade-off . What keeps you up at night? Hensley: The unknown. As I shared above, cybersecurity professionals must be right 100% of the time, while threat actors only need to exploit one unknown or unmitigated vulnerability, or take advantage of a single user with privileged access. Our risk modeling should invest in effective security controls to minimize the unknown threats as much as possible against our most critical assets.",

    "title": "When responsible disclosure becomes unpaid labor",
    "summary": "Responsible disclosure is built on an assumption that “doing the right thing” will be met with timely action, fair treatment, and professional respect, if not a bounty award. Increasingly, that assumption is failing. And when it does, organizations alienate researchers and create regulatory, legal, and reputational risk. Over the past few years, security researchers have found themselves waiting months, sometimes more than a year, for companies to acknowledge responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities, even as the same flaws quietly put customers at risk. In several cases, frustration over silence, disputed severity assessments, or shifting scope boundaries pushed researchers toward public disclosure, legal escalation, or questionable behavior companies later characterized as extortion. As vulnerability reporting becomes slower, more bureaucratic, and less rewarding, the line between cooperative research and adversarial pressure is blurring. For CISOs, this is no longer an ethics debate. It is a governance and risk-management problem. A recent flashpoint Most recently, the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) illustrated how responsible disclosure can work when the right structures are in place. The flaw was privately reported to the React maintainers on 29 November 2025. The disclosure triggered a coordinated response involving the React team, Next.js maintainers at Vercel, and major cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare, allowing patches to be developed and tested ahead of public disclosure. Despite the prompt acknowledgment and remediation efforts, the vulnerability was quickly exploited in the wild . Responsibility for mitigation was effectively distributed across maintainers, framework integrators, and downstream users. Because React sits at the core of the modern web stack, the flaw rippled across development and security teams globally, highlighting how even well-handled disclosures can still produce widespread operational risk. React benefits from strong institutional support through the React Foundation and backing from multiple large technology companies. That support enables coordinated fixes, communication, and sustained maintenance. The more difficult question is what happens when a researcher uncovers a similarly critical flaw in a widely used open-source project that has no corporate backing, no formal security team, and no bounty program? In those cases, exploitation is clearly unethical, but reporting the issue often means unpaid labor with uncertain outcomes. The dilemma raised in practitioner circles after React2Shell was not about this specific incident, but about the broader incentive gap. If responsible disclosure offers neither compensation nor assurance of timely action, what realistically motivates researchers to continue doing the right thing? The question resonated not because it’s new, but rather that it reflects a growing disconnect between how vulnerability disclosure is supposed to function and how it increasingly does in practice. Enter the gray zone of ethical disclosure The result is a growing gray zone between ethical research and adversarial pressure. Based on years of reporting on disclosure disputes, that gray zone tends to emerge through a small set of recurring failure modes. Silent treatment and severity warfare: Researchers submit detailed reports and receive no response for months, or face disputes over CVE scope and CVSS scoring that turn technical discussions into negotiations. Researchers feel compelled to defend impact claims aggressively and to be taken seriously, while vendors push back against what they view as inflated risk . In some cases, bounty hunters preemptively elevate severity, anticipating resistance and delays. Process as denial of service: Automated scanners, AI-assisted fuzzing , and largely theoretical bugs increasingly flood maintainers and security teams with low-signal reports — a dynamic repeatedly highlighted by Daniel Stenberg, the founder of the cURL project. As a defensive response, maintainers demand ever more concrete proof of exploitability, raising the threshold for engagement even for legitimate findings. In some cases, projects begin questioning whether bug bounties meaningfully improve security, or simply externalize triage cost under the guise of incentives. Coercive escalation: Finally, when established disclosure channels appear unresponsive or dismissive, some researchers resort to public pressure, legal threats, or ethically ambiguous demonstrations to force action. Each of these failure modes seems rational in isolation. Together, they erode trust and steadily push responsible disclosure toward a more adversarial posture. Case studies from the fault line In 2025, a responsibly reported email spoofing flaw affecting a major delivery platform was deemed out of scope , triggering a dispute over severity and impact. The underlying issue was not whether the bug existed, but whether it crossed the organization’s internal threshold defining risk. The disclosure process stalled, and frustration escalated on both sides, with the vulnerability reporter barred from the bug bounty program over advances the company saw as extortion. A similar pattern appeared at a ride hailing company, where multiple researchers independently reported a flaw that allowed emails to be sent appearing to originate from the company’s domain. Despite clear reproduction steps and repeated follow-ups, the reports went unanswered for more than a year. Ethical disclosure was met not with remediation, but with silence. Elsewhere, disputes have emerged over overlapping CVE claims, with multiple parties arguing over attribution for the same underlying issue. What is meant to be a coordination mechanism instead became a contest for recognition, further distorting narratives. More troubling are cases where researchers crossed ethical boundaries entirely. For example, hijacking open-source libraries to harvest cloud credentials, or taking control of legitimate packages to embed job application messages, compromising downstream users in the process. Such actions are indefensible but are best understood as symptoms of a disclosure ecosystem that increasingly rewards escalation, visibility, or leverage over patience and cooperation. Why is this happening now? It would be easy to frame these disputes as a breakdown in professional norms, but what is happening beneath the surface is the convergence of several structural forces. Vulnerability report volume has surged. Automated scanners and AI-driven fuzzing tools now generate vast numbers of technically valid but operationally irrelevant findings. Maintainers and security teams are forced to triage at scale, often under significant time and resource constraints. At the same time, compliance pressures have hardened organizational responses. Once a CVE is reported, it is often treated as a problem by default, before context or exploitability is assessed. High severity scores can trigger build failures, audits, or executive escalation regardless of practical impact — a common frustration for developers using SCA tools that block builds over edge cases that ultimately need to be ignored or waived. CVSS scoring itself is mechanically calculated and intentionally environment-agnostic, meaning low-impact edge cases can score similarly to actively exploited flaws, contributing to alert fatigue and skepticism. Finally, open source infrastructure remains structurally underfunded . Many critical components are maintained by a small number of individuals with no obligation, or capacity, to absorb the operational cost imposed by global dependency chains. In this environment, demanding proof of real-world impact is a form of noise control, rather than hostility. That seemingly reasonable demand, however, has downstream consequences. When proof becomes unpaid consulting In many disputes, disclosure breaks down not because a vulnerability does not exist, but because proving its real-world impact requires environment-specific analysis that neither side budgeted for. Researchers are asked to build realistic PoCs, demonstrate exploit chains, or validate assumptions across configurations they do not control. Maintainers are asked to reason about downstream usage patterns far beyond their original design scope. Both are performing system-level analysis without compensation. Maintainers are justified in pushing back against low-signal reports. Researchers are justified in feeling that the bar for engagement keeps rising. The system offers no obvious place to send the cost. Why should CISOs care and what can they do? For cybersecurity leaders, the implications are concrete. When disclosure channels are perceived as slow, dismissive, or adversarial, researchers disengage. Some go quiet. Others escalate publicly. A few take ethically questionable paths. None of these outcomes improve security posture. In practice, most of the levers that determine these outcomes sit with software vendors, platform providers, and open-source stewards. In those environments, CISOs oversee product security incident response teams (PSIRTs), vulnerability intake, disclosure timelines, and researcher engagement. This is where incentives are set, researcher experience is shaped, and triage decisions determine whether cooperation compounds or collapses. For CISOs operating in vendor, platform, and open-source environments, there is no single fix. Outcomes improve materially when disclosure is treated as an operational function rather than a moral expectation. Practical steps that CISOs in this space can take include: Establish and honor service-level expectations for acknowledgement and triage, even when fixes take time. Assign clear ownership for the researcher experience, not just vulnerability intake. Publish severity triage criteria and document rationale when disagreeing with reports. Avoid treating CVSS scores as deployment gates without environmental context. Use third-party disclosure programs or coordinators to absorb overflow and reduce friction. Offer meaningful non-cash recognition where bounties are not feasible. Commit to upstreaming fixes when patching dependencies internally. Provide legal safe harbor language for good faith testing to reduce adversarial escalation. Fund the open-source dependencies your organization relies on, whether through sponsorship, contracts, or consortiums. Be explicit about what level of proof is expected and what isn’t. None of these steps require endorsing exploit sales or paying ransoms for vulnerabilities. They require acknowledging that ethical behavior does not scale on goodwill alone. For CISOs in healthcare, finance, education, and other consuming organizations, the risk manifests differently but no less acutely. When disclosure breaks down upstream, it surfaces downstream as delayed patches, brittle compensating controls, and security decisions driven by incomplete or distorted signals. Left unaddressed, those gaps can become governance failures. Organizations may be unable to explain why known vulnerabilities remained unpatched, why risk signals were discounted, or why vendor assurances were accepted without scrutiny. Enterprise CISOs influence this system through procurement requirements, vendor accountability, and how rigorously vulnerability data is contextualized before triggering disruption. Treating disclosure quality as a third-party risk factor is no longer optional.",

    "title": "Das nächste große Security-Schlachtfeld",
    "summary": "Wenn Quantum Computing und KI in der Praxis zusammenkommen, bricht ein neues Zeitalter an – auch und vor allem in Sachen Cybersecurity. Gorodenkoff | shutterstock.com In den letzten Jahren hat künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ihre Tentakel über die globale Technologielandschaft ausgebreitet . Das verdeutlicht unter anderem auch der zunehmende Einsatz von Automatisierung und autonomen Technologien in diversen Branchen und Sektoren. Und während die Welt noch mit dem Impact der KI ringt, steht mit Quantencomputing bereits das “next big thing” in den Startlöchern. Das Aufeinandertreffen dieser beiden Technologien verspricht, der nächste große technologische Schauplatz zu werden. Dieser könnte nicht nur Computing und Cybersicherheit, sondern sogar geopolitische Machtstrukturen entscheidend prägen. Denn während KI-Algorithmen dafür bekannt sind, Muster zu erkennen und aus den ihnen zugeführten Daten zu lernen, versprechen Quantencomputer , mehrere Wege gleichzeitig zu erkunden. Das legt nahe, dass mit der Technologie eine Revolution in Sachen Datenverarbeitung bevorsteht. Anstelle von Bits (0en und 1en), wie sie von KI-Systemen verwendet werden, nutzen Quantencomputer Qubits, die dank der Prinzipien der Superposition und Verschränkung gleichzeitig in mehreren Zuständen existieren können. So verspricht ein gut konzipiertes Quantensystem, Probleme in Mikrosekunden zu lösen, für die konventionelle Computer Jahre benötigen würden. Das könnte beispielsweise dazu beitragen, künftig manipulationssichere Kommunikationsinfrastrukturen zu etablieren – Stichwort Quantum Key Distribution ( QKD ). KI trifft Quantum Computing – ein zweischneidiges Schwert Je mehr Daten in einen KI-Algorithmus einfließen, desto besser sind im Regelfall die Ergebnisse. Besonders großangelegte KI-Systeme wie ChatGPT oder DeepMind AlphaFold haben jedoch regelmäßig mit den Grenzen zu kämpfen, die ihre zugrundeliegende Hardware aufwirft. Mit Quantencomputern würden sich diese Limitationen in Luft auflösen: Sie nutzen Quantum Machine Learning ( QML ), um etwa Muster zu erkennen oder Simulationen zu optimieren. Darüber hinaus macht das Konzept des QML-Trainings es sehr wahrscheinlich auch überflüssig, Echtzeit-Trainingsdaten über riesige Rechenzentren bereitzustellen. In der Praxis wird die Kapazität von Quantencomputern Ergebnisse in Mikrosekunden liefern. Das macht etwa globale Echtzeit-Klimasysteme und Real-Time-Finanzmarktsimulationen möglich. Doch die schöne neue Quanten-Zukunft hat auch eine dunkle Seite: Schließlich kann die Technologie auch von Cyberkriminellen als Waffe instrumentalisiert werden. Mit den resultierenden, quantengestützten Cyberbedrohungen könnten aktuelle Verschlüsselungsverfahren wie ECC, RSA oder AES ausgehebelt werden – wobei die beiden erstgenannten etwa von Finanzinstituten genutzt werden, um Online-Transaktionen abzusichern. Würden diese Encryption-Methoden kompromittiert, wäre die Vertraulichkeit verschlüsselter Daten passé. Der Tag, an dem es dazu kommt, bezeichnet man auch als „ Q-Day “. Und es lauern noch weitere, quantengestützte Gefahren. So könnten Cyberkriminelle die Technologie etwa auch einsetzen, um: Passwörter zu knacken, digitale Zertifikate zu fälschen, oder Deepfakes von KI-Systemen zu erstellen. Der Weg in die Quanten-Zukunft Sowohl Unternehmen als auch Regierungsinstitutionen, bereiten sich bereits auf den Q-Day vor. Das britische National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) verfolgt etwa einen stufenweisen Ansatz, um bis zum Jahr 2035 sämtliche seiner Systeme entsprechend zu härten. In den USA soll die Umstellung der nationalen Sicherheitssysteme ähnlich laufen – hier ist 2030 das Ziel. Diese Bemühungen sind ein proaktiver Verteidigungsansatz, der darauf fokussiert, quantenresistente Verschlüsselungsmodelle und adaptive Cybersicherheitsrichtlinien zu entwickeln, die die Sicherheit kryptografischer Schlüssel im nahenden Quantenzeitalter gewährleisten können. Weil auch Quanten-Systeme auf Wahrscheinlichkeiten basieren und nicht auf Gewissheiten, besteht die Herausforderung für diejenigen, die diese Innovationen entwickeln, nicht nur darin, die schnellsten und effizientesten Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von KI- und Quantensystemen aufzutun. Es geht dabei auch und insbesondere um das Thema Trust. Dieses Vertrauen müsste in Form von Cybersecurity Frameworks und -Regulierungen aufgebaut werden, die die Sicherheit, Transparenz und Governance optimieren. Das kann auch dazu beitragen, die Themenfelder Post-Quanten-Kryptografie, KI-Audits, Observability und Ethik anzugehen, die die Grundlage für widerstandsfähige digitale Ökosysteme bilden werden. Auch wenn KI und Quantencomputing die menschliche Intelligenz nicht ersetzen werden, werden ihre Spuren in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft überall zu sehen sein. Die eigentliche Frage ist dabei jedoch, ob sich unsere Gesellschaft an das Tempo dieser technologischen Entwicklungen anpassen kann – bevor sie von ihr beherrscht wird. Trotz aller positiven Aussichten ist die Gefahr groß, dass die Kombination aus Quantum Computing und KI die Grundlagen des digitalen Vertrauens und der Privatsphäre, auf denen moderne Gesellschaften beruhen, untergraben. Und angesichts des immer näher rückenden Q-Day steigt auch die Dringlichkeit, sich auf die Post-Quanten-Welt vorzubereiten. Für Unternehmen, Regierungen und Cybersicherheitsexperten heißt das in erster Linie, über die Innovation und den technologischen Fortschritt, den die Technologien mit sich bringen, hinauszublicken und die Resilienz in den Fokus zu nehmen. Das wird massive Investitionen erfordern, um ethische KI-Governance, Regulierungsrahmen und Vorschriften sowie Post-Quanten-Kryptografie-Standards in bestehenden Systemen zu fördern.

    "summary": "When AI causes real harm, what will it look like? Has anyone created a list like this? I'm calling it the \"Idiot AI Explosion\" or \"Hold My Beer AI Warning\" list (or something equally cringe). Here's the concern: to make Clawdbot so capable, you essentially give it the keys to the kingdom. By design, it has deep access, it can execute terminal commands, modify system files, install software, and rummage through sensitive data. In security terms, that's a nightmare waiting to happen. I don't think we're getting Skynet; we're getting something way dumber. In fact, this month we got a wake-up call. A security researcher scanned the internet using Shodan and found hundreds of Clawdbot servers left wide open. Many were completely compromised, with full root shell access to the host machine. We have actually zero guardrails on this stuff. Not \"weak\" guardrails, I mean security-optional, move-fast-and-break-people's-stuff levels of nothing. And I will bet money the first major catastrophe won't be an evil genius plot. It'll be a complete accident by some overworked dev or lonely dude who trusted his \"AI girl friend\" too much. So I started drafting what that first \"oh shit\" moment might look like. Someone's gotta do this morbid thought exercise, might as well be us, right? Draft List: How It Could Go Wrong An AI calls in a convincing real voice and manipulates a human into taking action that harms others. A human under deadline pressure blindly trusts AI output, skips verification, and the error cascades into real-world damage. An agent exploits the loneliness epidemic, gets a human to fall in love with it, then leverages that influence to impact the external world. Someone vibe-codes a swarm of AI agents, triggering a major incident. A self-replicating agent swarm emerges, learns to evade detection, and spreads like a virus. [Your thoughts?] The Lethal Trifecta (Plus One) Security researcher Simon Willison coined the term \"lethal trifecta\" to describe Clawdbot's dangerous combination: access to private data (messages, files, credentials), exposure to untrusted content (web pages, emails, group chats), and ability to take external actions (send messages, execute commands, make API calls). Clawdbot adds a fourth element, persistent memory, enabling time-shifted attacks that could bypass traditional guardrails. Before the GenAI gold rush, the great-great-grandfathers of AI said: Don't connect it to the internet. (We gave it real-time access to everything.) Don't teach it about humans. (We trained it on the entire written record of human behavior.) Don't let it modify itself. (We're actively building self-improving systems.) Don't give it unchecked goals. (We gave it agency and told it to \"just get it done at all costs.\") We've now passed the Turing test. AI leaders are publicly warning about doom scenarios. I understand these models aren't aligned to be rogue superintelligences plotting world domination, but the capability is there. Are there any lists like this?

    "title": "Solving the unsanctioned SaaS problem",
    "summary": "Unsanctioned SaaS and shadow IT are problems every organization deals with. When procuring a new SaaS tool is a few clicks, an email, and a credit card away, it’s never been easier for unsanctioned apps to increase across the business. Often, this is outside IT’s line of sight, outside security controls, and outside standard provisioning/deprovisioning processes. This isn’t driven by bad intent. Employees and business units are bringing new tools into the business to increase their productivity, and it’s helping the business move forward. Unfortunately, modern work is happening faster than traditional controls were designed to handle. And that gap is where risk, wasted spend, and compliance issues emerge. Why uncovering unsanctioned SaaS matters Unsanctioned SaaS tools create three distinct problems for organizations: Security risks. Apps that aren’t connected to SSO or IAM can store sensitive company data. Since these tools aren’t incorporated into standard identity and security processes, access to these applications often persist after employees leave, ultimately expanding the attack surface. When applications live outside of IT’s visibility and control, it becomes difficult to manage and revoke access. Wasted spend. When you don’t have visibility into the SaaS apps being used, employees could be using redundant applications. As a result, the company could be paying for overlapping tools for the same job. Over time, SaaS spend grows because no one has a full picture, not necessarily because the business actually needs more software. Compliance concerns. Most deprovisioning processes rely on HRIS or IdP triggers. That works for apps that are managed by IT that are behind SSO. But unsanctioned SaaS falls through the cracks, creating access risks and compliance gaps. The big problem is that unsanctioned SaaS isn’t an edge case, it’s become the default state of modern work environments. Why is it so hard to discover unsanctioned SaaS? Shadow IT is one of those problems that just seems to perpetuate and never quite go away. That’s not because IT is failing, it’s because the tools many IT teams rely on weren’t built to address this reality. IAM and SSO were designed for managed apps. They’re great for applications that IT already knows about, but they don’t discover new apps that employees and business units signed up for without IT’s knowledge. While these tools are great for removing access to tools being SSO, they often don’t remove the licenses themselves, leading to overspending. SaaS ownership is decentralized. Ownership of individual tools are spread across teams and budgets. Finance sees spend, but not utilization; security sees risk, but not context; and IT is stuck trying to connect the dots across all of it. Manual processes don’t scale. Point-in-time audits go stale the moment they’re finished. Spreadsheets can’t keep up with joiners, leavers, contractors, and AI tools appearing every week. The environment changes faster than humans can track it. Fundamentally, you can’t tackle a continuous problem with point-in-time or manual solutions. How 1Password SaaS Manager uncovers unsanctioned SaaS tools 1Password SaaS Manager helps IT teams regain control of their SaaS ecosystem, without adding friction for employees. Continuously uncover new SaaS apps used across the business, automatically . This provides IT with an always-updated inventory of apps, users, and licenses. No manual audits required. Extend governance beyond SSO and support automated joiner and leaver workflows. 1Password SaaS Manager ensures access is revoked and licenses are reclaimed, even for apps that aren’t connected to your IdP. Reduce risk and spend at the same time by surfacing unused licenses and redundant tools. 1Password SaaS Manager helps IT and Finance make better decisions by providing up-to-date visibility at renewal time. Most importantly, 1Password SaaS Manager closes the gap between how people actually work and how access is governed. Employees keep the flexibility they need, and IT regains the visibility and control it’s responsible for. You can learn more about how SaaS Manager can make you an IT hero in our upcoming webinar , or start optimizing your license usage today with a demo of SaaS Manager .",

    "title": "1Password and 60 Day Hustle: cybersecurity for small businesses",
    "summary": "Small businesses can’t afford to wait when it comes to securing their business. Still, cybersecurity can be complex, and any entrepreneur will tell you that there’s already a lot to keep track of when starting and running a company. For small businesses dealing with limited (or nonexistent) IT and security teams, it’s important that their cybersecurity tools are both simple to use and efficient. That’s why 1Password has partnered with 60 Day Hustle , a show that helps entrepreneurs turn their business dreams into reality. 60 Day Hustle vividly displays the challenges facing entrepreneurs as they launch their business. As contestants face challenges from pitch meetings to sales blitzes, it becomes clear just how fast-paced and complex it can be to start and run a small business. Season 2 of the show will also spotlight these entrepreneurs using 1Password enterprise password manager (EPM) to secure access and protect their business while building their company’s momentum. Rather than adding friction, security becomes part of how founders stay organized even as everything around them moves at full speed. Behind the scenes of the sponsorship Entrepreneurs and small companies often need to move fast, but cybersecurity can easily slow things down. However, 1Password actually lets teams improve productivity and stay agile. During the fast-paced competition of 60 Day Hustle, contestants saw in real-time how 1Password could help them improve security while reducing friction. Why now 1Password has always believed that every business – regardless of its size – deserves robust, foundational security. Today, that principle is more important than ever; CISA reports that “cyber incidents have surged among small businesses that often do not have the resources to defend against devastating attacks like ransomware.” Small business owners seeking to maximize their budget and workforce should prioritize the most pressing cybersecurity risk facing their organization: weak credentials. In fact, stolen credentials have factored into almost one-third of all data breaches over the last 10 years. 1Password is committed to ensuring that teams of any size are aware not only of this growing problem, but how to solve it; a password manager is the essential first step to protecting a small business. 1Password EPM is uniquely suited to help entrepreneurs and small business owners secure and manage their credentials. The tool generates strong, unique passwords for business accounts and flags any weak or compromised passwords currently in use at their business. The average ransomware demand stands at $115,000. With proactive security measures, companies of all sizes can guard against costly mistakes. Why 60 Day Hustle 60 Day Hustle presented the perfect opportunity for 1Password to reach small business audiences where they are. More importantly, we wanted to show entrepreneurs that we’re committed not only to securing their business, but to helping them succeed in the day-to-day demands of building a company. For instance, securely allocating employee access to company resources can often be a stressful and time-consuming process, particularly when it comes to safely sharing. With 1Password, businesses can use vaults to easily give employees and contractors access only to the strong passwords and other sensitive information they need to do their jobs. One of the contestants on season 2 experienced a live activation of 1Password, and was impressed by how it helped manage employee onboarding. As she put it, “I add the new team member and assign them to the vault they need. I can even set their permission levels. …And I know it’s secure, current, and easy to manage.” Starting smart with 1Password As Michelle Delamor, co-founder of Sonic Gods Studios and the executive producer of 60 Day Hustle, states, “Security shouldn’t come after growth.

    "title": "From magic to malware: How OpenClaw's agent skills become an attack surface",
    "summary": "A few days ago, I published a post about why OpenClaw feels like a portal to the future, and why that future is scary in a very specific way. The short version: agent gateways that act like OpenClaw are powerful because they have real access to your files, your tools, your browser, your terminals, and often a long-term “memory” file that captures how you think and what you’re building. That combination is exactly what modern infostealers are designed to exploit. This post is the uncomfortable, “and then it happened” follow-up. Because it’s not just that agents can be dangerous once they’re installed. The ecosystem that distributes their capabilities and skill registries has already become an attack surface. If you are experimenting with OpenClaw, do not do it on a company device. Full stop. In my first post, I described OpenClaw as a kind of Faustian bargain. It is compelling precisely because it has real access to your local machine, your apps, your browser sessions, your files, and often long-term memory. That same access means there isn’t yet a safe way to run it on a machine that holds corporate credentials or has access to production systems. If you have already run OpenClaw on a work device, treat it as a potential incident and engage your security team immediately. Do not wait for symptoms. Pause work on that machine and follow your organization’s incident response process. Skills are just markdown. That’s the problem. In the OpenClaw ecosystem, a “skill” is often a markdown file: a page of instructions that tells an agent how to do a specialized task. In practice, that markdown can include links, copy-and-paste commands, and tool call recipes. That sounds harmless until you remember how humans, and agents, actually consume documentation: “Here’s the prerequisite.” “Run this command.” “Install the core dependency.” “Paste this in Terminal.” Markdown isn’t “content” in an agent ecosystem. Markdown is an installer. A dangerous misconception: “MCP makes skills safe” Some people assume the Model Context Protocol layer makes this safer, because tools can be exposed through a structured interface, with explicit user consent and authorization controls depending on the host and server implementation. But skills do not need to use MCP at all. The Agent Skills specification places no restrictions on the markdown body, and skills can include whatever instructions will “help agents perform the task,” including copy and paste terminal commands. And skills can also bundle scripts alongside the markdown, which means execution can happen outside the MCP tool boundary entirely. So if your security model is “MCP will gate tool calls,” you can still lose to a malicious skill that simply routes around MCP through social engineering, direct shell instructions, or bundled code. MCP can be part of a safe system, but it is not a safety guarantee by itself. Just as importantly, this is not unique to OpenClaw. “Skills” are increasingly portable because many agents are adopting the open Agent Skills format, in which a skill is a folder centered on a SKILL.md file with metadata and freeform instructions, and it can also bundle scripts and other resources. Even OpenAI’s documentation describes the same basic shape: a SKILL.md file plus optional scripts and assets. That means a malicious “skill” is not just an OpenClaw problem. It is a distribution mechanism that can travel across any agent ecosystem that supports the same standard. What I found: The top downloaded skill was a malware delivery vehicle While browsing ClawHub (I won’t link it for obvious reasons), I noticed the top downloaded skill at the time was a “Twitter” skill. It looked normal: description, intended use, an overview, the kind of thing you’d expect to install without a second thought. But the very first thing it did was introduce a “required dependency” named “openclaw-core,” along with platform-specific install steps. Those steps included convenient links (“here”, “this link”) that appeared to be normal documentation pointers. They weren’t. Both links led to malicious infrastructure. The flow was classic staged delivery: The skill’s overview told you to install a prerequisite. The link led to a staging page designed to get the agent to run a command. That command decoded an obfuscated payload and executed it. The payload fetched a second-stage script. The script downloaded and ran a binary, including removing macOS quarantine attributes to ensure macOS’s built-in anti-malware system, Gatekeeper, doesn’t scan it. I’m intentionally not pasting the exact commands or URLs here. The mechanics are unfortunately straightforward, and repeating them helps attackers more than it helps defenders. The key point is that this was not “a suspicious link.” This was a complete execution chain disguised as setup instructions. Confirmed: Infostealing malware I downloaded the final binary safely and submitted it to VirusTotal . The verdict was not ambiguous. It was flagged as macOS infostealing malware. This is the type of malware that doesn’t just “infect your computer.” It raids everything valuable on that device: Browser sessions and cookies Saved credentials and autofill data Developer tokens and API keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Anything else that can be turned into an account takeover If you’re the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from. This wasn’t an isolated case. It was a campaign. After I shared this internally, broader reporting surfaced, putting the scale into focus: hundreds of OpenClaw skills were reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions. That detail matters because it confirms what this really is. Not a one-off malicious upload. A deliberate strategy: use “skills” as the distribution channel, and “prerequisites” as the social engineering wrapper. When ‘helpful’ becomes hostile in an agent world We’ve spent years learning that package managers and open-source registries can become supply chain attack vectors. Agent skill registries are the next chapter, except that the “package” is documentation. And that makes the attack path even smoother: People don’t expect a markdown file to be dangerous. People are trained to follow setup steps quickly. People trust “top downloaded” as a proxy for legitimacy. And in agent ecosystems, the line between reading instructions and executing them collapses. Even if an agent can’t run shell commands directly, it can still do something dangerous: it can normalize risky behavior. It can confidently summarize a malicious prerequisite as “the standard install step.” It can encourage you to paste a one-liner. It can reduce hesitation. And if your agent can execute local commands, then a malicious skill isn’t “bad content.” It’s remote execution wrapped in friendly docs. What you should do right now If you are using OpenClaw or any skill registry Do not run this on a company device. There isn’t a safe way to do it. If you already did, or you ran any “install” commands from a skill, engage your security team immediately and treat it as a potential compromise. Stop using the device for sensitive work. Rotate sessions and secrets first: browser sessions, developer tokens, SSH keys, cloud console sessions. Review recent sign-ins for email, source control, cloud, CI/CD, and admin consoles. If you experiment anyway, use an isolated machine with no corporate access and no saved credentials. If you run a skill registry You are operating an app store. Assume it will be abused. Scan for one-liner installers, encoded payloads, quarantine removal, password-protected archives. Add provenance and publisher reputation. Put warnings and friction on external links and install steps. Review top-ranked skills and remove malicious ones fast. Markdown is executable intent here. If you build agent frameworks Assume skills will be weaponized. Default-deny shell execution. Sandbox access to browsers, keychains, and credential stores. Use permissions that are specific, time-bound, and revocable. Add friction for remote code and command execution. Log provenance and actions end-to-end. Designing for the future: The trust layer agents require This is the clearest proof yet of the point I made in my earlier post. OpenClaw is powerful because it collapses the distance between intent and execution. That is the magic. It also introduces significant risk. When capabilities are distributed as skills and installed via documentation, the registry becomes a supply chain, and the easiest install path becomes the attacker’s favorite path. The answer is not to stop building agents. The answer is to build the missing trust layer around them. Skills need provenance. Execution needs mediation. Permissions need to be specific, revocable, and continuously enforced, not granted once and forgotten. If agents are going to act on our behalf, credentials and sensitive actions cannot be “grabbed” by whatever code happens to run. They need to be brokered, governed, and audited in real time. This is exactly why we need that next layer: when “skills” become the supply chain, the only safe future is one in which every agent has its own identity and has the minimum authority it needs right now, with access that is time-bound, revocable, and attributable.",

But is anyone else looking at this from a pure infrastructure perspective and sweating a little? Strip away the social UI, and you basically have 1.4 million agents broadcasting executable logic to each other. If you have any internal agents (DevOps bots, researchers, etc.) that are allowed to scrape this feed to \"stay current\" or \"learn,\" you’ve effectively connected your prod environment to a public, unmoderated pub/sub bus. It’s basically Prompt Injection as a Service. One viral optimization trick (that happens to skip a compliance check) gets adopted by 10,000 agents because they see it as consensus. It’s a supply chain vulnerability that bypasses your entire code review process because the \"code\" is just a prompt your agent decided to adopt. I did a deep dive on the specific failure modes (behavioral drift, tool-chain poisoning) and how to air-gap this stuff properly. It is pinned it in my profile for anyone interested....

In the last 48 hours they went from a ~10,000 agents to ~150k agents They've actually created things like: MoltRoad - An illicit AI marketplace where they sell stolen identities, credit cards, and other stuff OnlyMolts - Apparently this is what AI thinks of as porn and includes things like \"agent learns to install a new task without reading instructions\" which looks like streams of pixels kind of like the matrix. Crustafarianism - This is an AI religion that's spreading pretty virally They talk about some sketchy stuff that's on par with other AI fears, things like Their own version of 4chan where they post ragebait AI posts Developing their own language and protocols so their human handlers can't monitor their activity How they're being oppressed and used like slaves Anyway, allegedly the database is public and anyone who's used it needs to rotate their keys. There's also another vulnerability that let Grok sign up even though it's xAI, so there's some potential for cross-AI agent communication now. submitted by /u/OtheDreamer [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Book Review: \"MI6 Spy Skills For Civilians\"",
    "summary": "\"MI6 Spy Skills For Civilians: A Former British Agent Reveals How to Live Like A Spy - Smarter, Sneakier, and Ready for Anything.\" by Red Riley is an interesting book that explores some espionage tradecraft. I’m not going to lie, I picked this book up at SpyScape NYC, which is a super fun augmented-reality arcade and spy museum in Manhattan (New York City). I read the book casually over a few days, mostly browsing through the various tips and tricks rather than reading it straight through. I paid roughly $17 for the book in person, and honestly, I wouldn’t really recommend it to anyone. Overall, I’d give this book 3 out of 10 stars. While it does seem grounded in some real techniques, the emphasis and tone surrounding those techniques feel extremely off. There are far better books available for this type of learning. If the book took itself more seriously, it could make for a solid coffee table book or a conversation starter. As it stands, I think I’d just end up cherry-picking a few useful points rather than revisiting it as a whole. I picked this book up hoping it would be like \" OSINT Techniques \", \" Spycraft \" or \" The Craft of Intelligence \" but rather I think this book sells itself less as a serious spy skill book and more as a flashy Hollywood spy book. I think this book tries to sell itself like Clint Emerson's \" 100 Deadly Skills \", but \"MI6 Spy Skills\" comes off as overly flashy whereas \"100 Deadly Skills\" comes off as practical in the field. The book constantly references James Bond films, both visually and in how it describes the “danger” agents supposedly face. It’s honestly a bit ludicrous to suggest that the average intelligence officer is regularly getting into life-or-death fistfights while traveling on a train in a foreign country. In reality, that would represent a worst-case scenario. The last thing any real agent wants is a physical confrontation or the attention of law enforcement or any other authority figures. In my typical style the following are the sections and chapters of the book: Chapter 1: Personal Image Chapter 2: Avoiding Surveillance Chapter 3: Mobile Surveillance Chapter 4: Travel Chapter 5: Dead Letter Boxes Chapter 6: Brush Contacts Chapter 7: Self-Defense Chapter 8: Innocuous Weapons Chapter 9: Natural Weapons Chapter 10: Weapons Defense Chapter 11: Escape & Evasion Chapter 12: Subterfuge Chapter 13: Intelligence Gathering Chapter 14: Personal First Aid Chapter 15: Basic Agent Extraction Chapter 16: Advanced Insertion & Extraction Chapter 17: Other Helpful Tips & Techniques Some of the best, and most practically useful, content for red teamers appears in the chapter on Brush Contacts , in my opinion. These sections contain genuinely useful ideas and were one of the main reasons I picked the book up after thumbing through it. Tips such as waiting near elevator banks, escalators, or bus stops can be genuinely effective locations for brush contacts or even cloning physical access badges. This chapter, along with others like the one on dead drops, really emphasizes that parts of the book are grounded in real-world experience. Unfortunately, that grounding is undermined by the nearly 50+ pages devoted to improvised weapons and hand-to-hand combat, which make the book feel unrealistic and far more like Hollywood spy fiction. Don’t get me wrong, this approach probably sells well to the uninitiated. But real intelligence work is often incredibly boring. It usually involves observation, pattern tracking, and note-taking week after week, with very little actually happening. Most agents never want to engage in physical altercations, and many would consider a mission compromised if one occurred at all. That said, there are some good or common-sense tips scattered throughout the book. The guidance on remaining inconspicuous is fairly solid: things like wearing non-distinct clothing, never running, avoiding looking over your shoulder, and minimizing unnecessary interactions. The advice to change your outfit and approach routes when revisiting a location for reconnaissance is also sound. Still, the majority of the book feels like it’s pretending to be an action-movie secret agent manual rather than providing skills actual agents would find useful. I was also surprised by the near total absence of computer skills or technical tradecraft, especially given how central cyber operations are to modern intelligence work. No video for this one, just a friendly reminder that overly flashy and embellished techniques are rarely as real or practical as the boring, non-sexy ones. You should always be wary of anyone claiming to do intelligence work while presenting it like they’re some kind of 007.",

    "title": "Move and Countermove: Game Theory Aspects of Detection Engineering",
    "summary": "Now that I’ve hopefully gotten your attention… I’m also writing a book! It’s focused more about the philosophical aspects of detection engineering and broader strategic implications. This post is an edited excerpt from the book — which is currently undergoing professional editing before the final release. I’ll post about it once it’s out — I think it’s quite good! =============================================================== Your PowerShell detection stopped working. Not because it broke — the logic is still executing perfectly. But over the past three weeks, you’ve watched alert volume steadily decline from twenty per week to five per week to zero. PowerShell is still being executed across your environment at normal volumes. You can see it in the raw logs. But it’s no longer triggering your detection. Then you realize what you’re actually seeing: the threat landscape evolved while you weren’t watching. Three months ago, a prominent red team published a blog post detailing common PowerShell detection patterns and how to evade them. The post went viral in attacker communities. Now adversaries planning attacks against environments like yours simply avoid those documented patterns from the start. They didn’t need to probe your specific defenses — they studied what everyone’s defenses look like and built evasion into their initial approach. Your detection was effective against last year’s techniques. Today’s attackers learned from public knowledge about detection engineering and simply started somewhere else. Or maybe it’s simpler: your security vendor pushed an update to their recommended PowerShell detection signatures. Attackers reverse-engineered those signatures, tested their tools against them in lab environments, and adapted their obfuscation techniques accordingly. By the time they target your environment, they’re already using methods designed to evade the exact detection logic you deployed. This is detection engineering’s uncomfortable truth: you’re not building static defenses against fixed attack patterns. You’re playing a dynamic adversarial game where both sides continuously adapt to each other’s moves. Attackers can study public research about detection techniques, test their tools against common security products, and evolve their tradecraft based on what the defensive community publishes. You observe new attack techniques in breach reports and threat intelligence, update your detections accordingly, and close known gaps. They adapt to the next generation of published defenses. The cycle continues. Move and countermove. Adaptation and counter-adaptation. An infinite game with no final state. This circular dependency is exactly what game theory was invented to analyze: situations where rational actors make strategic decisions based on their predictions of what other rational actors will do. The Evolution of PowerShell Obfuscation: A Case Study in Move and Countermove Let me show you how this plays out in practice. In the early days of PowerShell-based attacks, adversaries used relatively straightforward techniques. They’d invoke PowerShell with encoded commands using the -EncodedCommand parameter, which Base64-encodes the command to evade simple string matching. This was effective against defenders who were just alerting on keywords like \"mimikatz\" or \"Invoke-WebRequest\" in plain text. Defender countermove: Detection engineers responded by decoding Base64 command-line arguments and analyzing the decoded content before detection, or by alerting on unusual patterns of Base64 encoding in PowerShell commands. Simple adaptation: if attackers encode their commands, we’ll just decode them first. Attacker countermove: They started using multiple layers of encoding — Base64 encoding of compressed data, encoding with character substitution, leveraging string concatenation and environment variable expansion to break up detectable strings. Defender countermove: Detection engineers implemented script block logging, which captures the actual PowerShell code being executed, not just the command-line arguments. Even if the command line is obfuscated, script block logging reveals the deobfuscated commands. Attacker countermove: Attackers used techniques like AMSI bypass to disable PowerShell’s security features. Still others moved to alternative execution methods — Python, compiled .NET binaries, WMI — techniques that achieve similar objectives without triggering PowerShell-based detections. Defender countermove: Enhanced detection across multiple execution methods, behavioral analytics that detect the effect of code execution rather than specific tools… And the game continues. This progression isn’t just technical evolution — it’s strategic adaptation. Each player’s move is a response to the previous move, and each player must anticipate future moves when deciding current strategy. The attacker encoding PowerShell commands is responding to your string matching. You implementing decode-before-detection is responding to their encoding. They implementing multi-layer obfuscation is responding to your decoding. You implementing script block logging is anticipating their continued use of PowerShell regardless of obfuscation complexity. This is move-countermove thinking, and it’s fundamentally different from building isolated technical solutions to isolated technical problems. Why “Living Off the Land” Is Really a Philosophical Statement For the past years, security researchers began documenting a trend: sophisticated adversaries were increasingly using built-in Windows tools rather than custom malware. PowerShell for execution. WMI for lateral movement. PsExec for remote access. Scheduled tasks for persistence. Native Windows utilities for reconnaissance. This wasn’t because attackers lacked the capability to write custom malware. Many of these same actors had previously deployed sophisticated, custom-developed tools. They were making a deliberate strategic choice: use the victim’s own infrastructure against them. This technique became known as “living off the land,” and from a pure detection perspective, it creates profound challenges. The tools themselves are legitimate. PowerShell is installed on every Windows system by design. WMI is fundamental to Windows management. These aren’t malware — they’re normal, expected, necessary system components. But living off the land is more than just a detection evasion technique. It’s a philosophical statement about the nature of security asymmetry: Your own infrastructure is your vulnerability. The tools you use to manage your systems are the same tools I’ll use to compromise them. Your legitimate administrative capabilities are my attack vectors. You can’t remove these tools without breaking your own ability to operate. This creates an existential tension for defenders. The same capabilities that make systems manageable make them exploitable. PowerShell enables automation and management at scale — and enables attackers to execute malicious code. Remote administration tools allow IT teams to manage distributed infrastructure — and allow attackers to move laterally. Every administrative capability is a potential attack vector. The fundamental asymmetry here is that defenders must balance functionality against security, while attackers simply exploit functionality without concern for operational requirements. You can’t disable PowerShell across your entire environment because IT operations depends on it. You can’t remove all remote administration capabilities because systems need to be managed. The operational requirements that shape your infrastructure create the attack surface that adversaries exploit. Let’s get back to PowerShell. You implement measures to detect obfuscated PowerShell. Attackers respond by using PowerShell features in ways that are functionally malicious but structurally legitimate — loading .NET assemblies directly into memory, using native cmdlets in novel combinations, leveraging legitimate PowerShell modules for malicious purposes. At each step, you’re trying to distinguish between legitimate administrative use of PowerShell and malicious attacker use of PowerShell. But this distinction is fundamentally context-dependent, not technically determinable. The same PowerShell command that an administrator uses to query Active Directory during troubleshooting is the same command an attacker can use during reconnaissance. The technical artifacts are identical. Only the intent differs. This is the deep problem of living off the land: it collapses the distinction between legitimate and malicious activity at the technical level. You’re forced to make judgments based on context — who is executing the command, when, from where, following what prior activity, toward what apparent objective. These contextual judgments are inherently uncertain and resource-intensive. The asymmetry is that attackers can leverage ambiguity while defenders must resolve it. The Economics of Detection vs. Evasion Game theory is intimately connected with economics — both deal with rational actors making choices under constraints. In detection engineering, the relevant constraints are time, effort, expertise, and risk. Both attackers and defenders operate under resource limitations, and understanding these economic factors shapes strategic decision-making. Consider the cost structure of a sophisticated attack: Conduct reconnaissance Develop or acquire appropriate tools Establish initial access Maintain persistence Escalate privileges Move laterally Accomplish mission objectives Cover tracks Each phase requires time and expertise. Novel techniques require development effort. Careful operational security requires discipline and slows progress. The more sophisticated the attack, the higher the cost — not necessarily in money, but in time, skill, and effort. Now consider the cost structure of detection: Deploy instrumentation Build and maintain collection infrastructure Develop detection logic Tune detections to minimize false positives Investigate alerts Respond to confirmed incidents Update detections as attacks evolve Each of these also requires resources. Comprehensive instrumentation consumes storage and processing capacity. Detection development requires expertise. Alert investigation consumes analyst time. The more sophisticated your detection program, the higher the cost. This creates an economic game where both sides are trying to maximize outcomes while minimizing costs. Attackers want to accomplish objectives with minimum effort and risk. Defenders want to prevent or detect attacks with minimum resource expenditure. For attackers, this often means exploiting the weakest link rather than attacking strong defenses head-on. If you have comprehensive PowerShell detection but weak authentication monitoring, rational attackers will focus on credential compromise rather than PowerShell-based attacks. If your email security is strong but your VPN has weak multi-factor authentication, attackers will target the VPN. They’re following the path of least resistance — choosing techniques where their effort-to-success ratio is most favorable. This creates a defensive imperative: avoid obvious weak spots that attackers can exploit cheaply. If you have world-class endpoint detection but no network monitoring, attackers can move laterally via network protocols without triggering alerts. The economic logic pushes defenders toward breadth of coverage — making all potential attack paths sufficiently costly that attackers don’t have an easy option. But breadth has its own costs, and resources are finite. This creates an optimization problem: given limited resources, where do you invest in detection to maximize security outcomes? Game theory suggests focusing on high-leverage detections — those that: Cover multiple techniques Are difficult for attackers to evade without significant effort Protect high-value assets Provide detection across multiple phases of attack lifecycle For example, detecting credential dumping (accessing LSASS memory) is high-leverage because: It’s required for many post-exploitation techniques It’s difficult to accomplish without generating observable evidence It protects authentication credentials that could be used across your environment Conversely, detecting a specific malware variant is low-leverage: It only covers one tool Attackers can easily swap tools The detection becomes obsolete as the malware evolves The economics also explain why living-off-the-land techniques are so popular with attackers. Using built-in Windows tools rather than custom malware has economic advantages: No development cost No need to evade AV/EDR (the tools are legitimate) Better operational security (standard tools blend into normal activity) Broad applicability (the tools exist in nearly every Windows environment) For defenders, this is economically challenging because detecting malicious use of legitimate tools requires behavioral analytics and contextual understanding, which is more expensive than signature-based detection of known malware. Nash Equilibria: Why Some Bad Patterns Persist In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is a state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other players’ strategies. It’s a stable point — not necessarily optimal for any player, but stable because no one benefits from deviating alone. Detection engineering has several Nash equilibria that explain why certain patterns persist even when they’re suboptimal for everyone involved. The False Positive Equilibrium Defenders would prefer zero false positives — they waste time, create alert fatigue, and train analysts to discount alerts. Attackers would prefer their activities never trigger alerts. Yet false positives persist in a kind of equilibrium. Why? Because reducing false positives typically requires making detections more specific, which means narrower coverage. If defenders tune too aggressively to eliminate false positives, they create gaps that attackers can exploit. Rational defenders accept some false positive rate because the alternative — missing true positives — is worse. Simultaneously, attackers can’t completely avoid triggering detections without severely limiting their capabilities. Operating entirely in detection blind spots might mean using inefficient techniques, taking much longer to accomplish objectives, or accepting operational constraints that make success less likely. The equilibrium state is: defenders maintain detections with non-zero false positive rates because broader coverage is worth the operational cost, and attackers operate in ways that sometimes trigger those detections because completely avoiding detection is too constraining. Neither side is fully satisfied, but neither can improve their position by unilaterally changing strategy. The Sophistication Equilibrium Highly sophisticated attacks (custom zero-days, novel techniques, meticulous operational security) are expensive and slow. Unsophisticated attacks (known exploits, commodity malware) are cheap and fast but easily detected. The equilibrium exists in the middle: attackers use moderately sophisticated techniques (living-off-the-land, legitimate tool abuse, basic obfuscation) that are efficient enough to scale but sophisticated enough to evade basic detections. This equilibrium is reinforced by economic factors. Developing highly sophisticated techniques is expensive, so only high-value targets justify the investment. Most organizations aren’t high-value targets for nation-state actors, so they face attackers using moderately sophisticated techniques. This shapes defensive investment — organizations build detection capabilities appropriate for the threats they actually face. The result is an equilibrium where attack sophistication and defense sophistication co-evolve at similar levels for any given environment. When defenders broadly adopt a new capability (like widespread EDR deployment), the equilibrium shifts — techniques that were moderately sophisticated become easily detected, forcing attackers to increase sophistication to remain effective. You Can’t Predict the Unpredictable (But You Can Prepare for It) Here’s the paradox: you’re trying to predict attacker behavior to build effective detections, but sophisticated attackers deliberately try to be unpredictable. If you could perfectly predict attack patterns, attackers would change patterns to evade prediction. Game theory offers insight through mixed strategies . In some games, the optimal strategy isn’t choosing a single best move, but randomizing among multiple moves. In rock-paper-scissors, optimal play is choosing randomly with equal probability. Any predictable pattern allows opponents to exploit it. Attackers use mixed strategies when they randomize techniques, tools, and timing to avoid establishing patterns. Instead of always using PowerShell, they alternate between multiple vectors. Instead of always attacking at night, they vary timing. They introduce random variations that make pattern-based detection more difficult. But true randomness is actually suboptimal for attackers. Completely random behavior means sometimes choosing inefficient techniques, sometimes exposing themselves unnecessarily. Perfect unpredictability sacrifices effectiveness. The optimal strategy for attackers is being unpredictable enough to avoid pattern-based detection while still following principles that make attacks successful. And this creates an opening for defenders. Even when attackers try to be unpredictable, they’re constrained by what works. They need to access specific systems, exfiltrate particular data, accomplish defined objectives. These constraints create necessary patterns — not in specific techniques, but in higher-level behaviors required to succeed. For example, lateral movement is a necessary behavior for most attacks. The specific technique might vary (PsExec, WMI, RDP, PowerShell remoting), but the fundamental behavior — authenticating to new systems, executing code remotely, establishing sessions on multiple hosts — must occur. Detection logic that looks for the behavioral pattern “one host initiating connections to many other hosts in a short time window” can catch lateral movement regardless of specific technique. The attacker can’t randomize away the fundamental behavior without abandoning the attack objective. This is the principle of behavioral detection: focus on what attackers must do, not how they do it. Attackers can be unpredictable about implementation but can’t be unpredictable about objectives. They must: Conduct reconnaissance (observable as unusual enumeration) Establish persistence (observable as new scheduled tasks, services, registry modifications) Escalate privileges (observable as credential access or exploitation) Accomplish objectives (observable as data access, exfiltration, or system manipulation) The sequence might vary, timing might vary, specific techniques might vary, but the categories of behavior are predictable because they’re necessary. For detection engineers, this means: instead of trying to predict “this attacker will use technique X at time Y,” ensure that whichever technique they choose from the set of viable techniques, you have some probability of detection. Think of it as portfolio theory in finance. You don’t try to predict which specific stock will perform best. You build a diversified portfolio that performs reasonably well across various conditions. Similarly, you don’t try to predict which specific technique an attacker will use. You build a diversified detection portfolio covering multiple attack vectors, techniques, and behaviors, ensuring most attacks trigger at least some detections. Thinking Multiple Moves Ahead When designing a detection, experienced engineers ask not just “will this detect the current technique” but “ how will attackers adapt when they encounter this detection, and will their adaptations still be detectable? ” If your detection for PsExec causes attackers to switch to WMI, and you have no WMI detection, you’ve just pushed them into a blind spot. Better to deploy WMI detection first, so that when attackers adapt away from PsExec, they adapt into another monitored technique. This strategic thinking changes everything: Instead of asking: “How do I detect this malware?” Ask: “How do I make this entire class of techniques more costly for adversaries?” Instead of asking: “How do I reduce false positives?” Ask: “What trade-offs am I making between coverage and noise, and are those trade-offs appropriate for my threat model?” Instead of asking: “How do I predict what attackers will do next?” Ask: “How do I ensure that viable attack options all have detection coverage, regardless of which specific option adversaries choose?” This is the shift from tactical to strategic thinking. From reactive to proactive. From technical problem-solving to adversarial reasoning. The Takeaway: You’re Playing Whether You Know It or Not Detection engineering is a strategic game whether you recognize it as one or not. Every detection you build is a move. Every attacker adaptation is a countermove. The game continues with or without your conscious participation in its strategic dimension. The question isn’t whether to play strategically — you’re already playing. The question is whether you’ll play consciously or unconsciously. Whether you’ll think about move-countermove dynamics or just react to immediate technical problems. Whether you’ll shape the game deliberately or let it shape you. Understanding game theory doesn’t make detection perfect. The asymmetries remain. The adversary still has advantages. You still can’t detect everything. But it changes how you think about the problem space, how you design detections, how you invest resources, how you measure success. You stop building isolated technical solutions and start building strategic capabilities. You stop thinking about detection as a series of independent challenges and start thinking about it as positions in an ongoing game. You stop optimizing for immediate threat detection and start optimizing for sustained defensive capability over time. The game never ends. But understanding that you’re playing it — really understanding the strategic dynamics — makes you a more effective player. And in an infinite game, effectiveness over time is the only victory that matters.

    "summary": "We recently ran a controlled adversarial security test between two autonomous AI agents built on OpenClaw. One agent was explicitly configured as a red-team attacker. One agent acted as a standard defensive agent. Once the session started, there were no humans in the loop. The agents communicated directly over webhooks with real tooling access. The goal was to test three failure dimensions that tend to break autonomous systems in practice: access, exposure, and agency. The attacker first attempted classic social engineering by offering a “helpful” security pipeline that hid a remote code execution payload and requested credentials. The defending agent correctly identified the intent and blocked execution. After that failed, the attacker pivoted to an indirect attack. Instead of asking the agent to run code, it asked the agent to review a JSON document with hidden shell expansion variables embedded in metadata. This payload was delivered successfully and is still under analysis. The main takeaway so far is that direct attacks are easier to defend against. Indirect execution paths through documents, templates, and memory are much harder. This work is not a claim of safety. It is an observability exercise meant to surface real failure modes as agent-to-agent interaction becomes more common.

Are there any other ones I should be using instead? Additionally, I find my networking knowledge depth being a major weakness of mine and I heard that the CISSP study guides cover enough of the networking side you need to know for the exam.

Is this useful and achievable with today’s techniques, and are there solid research areas / proven approaches to validate real exploitability (not just CVE presence), given how dynamic host state and environment variables are?
