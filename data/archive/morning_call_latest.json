  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Multiple critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows components (PowerShell, Outlook, Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver) actively exploited; urgent patching and detection needed.\n- React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) frontend vulnerability under active exploitation by North Korean threat actors deploying EtherRAT malware targeting cloud and internal APIs.\n- Critical Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) vulnerability enabling admin session hijacking via stored XSS actively exploited; hundreds of exposed systems reported.\n- WinRAR zero-day RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-6218) under active attack by multiple threat groups; added to CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n- Supply chain threat “Shai-Hulud 2.0” guidance released by Microsoft; ongoing risk from compromised software dependencies.\n- High volume of SSH brute force attacks observed from Eastern Europe; increased vigilance on Linux/Unix systems recommended.\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Microsoft Windows Zero-Days (PowerShell, Outlook, Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver)**\n  - What: Multiple zero-day vulnerabilities patched in December Patch Tuesday; some already exploited in the wild.\n  - Why: These allow remote code execution and privilege escalation on critical Windows infrastructure.\n  - Actions: \n    - Prioritize immediate deployment of December 2025 security updates.\n    - Monitor EDR alerts for suspicious PowerShell activity (T1059.001), Outlook exploitation attempts, and privilege escalation events.\n    - Review Windows event logs and Defender telemetry for exploitation indicators.\n    - CVEs: CVE-2025-XXXX (PowerShell), CVE-2025-XXXX (Outlook), CVE-2025-XXXX (Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver).\n\n- **React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) Exploitation and EtherRAT Malware**\n  - What: Frontend React vulnerability enabling internal API access; exploited by North Korean APTs deploying EtherRAT backdoor.\n  - Why: Enables stealthy remote access and lateral movement in cloud and web environments.\n  - Actions:\n    - Confirm patching status of React server components and related web apps.\n    - Hunt for unusual API calls and proxy tunneling behavior in cloud logs.\n    - Monitor for EtherRAT indicators and network anomalies.\n    - CVE-2025-55182 priority patching and detection.\n\n- **Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) Critical RCE via Stored XSS**\n  - What: Critical vulnerability allowing admin session hijacking and remote code execution.\n  - Why: Hundreds of exposed systems online increase risk of compromise.\n  - Actions:\n    - Verify patch deployment on all Ivanti EPM instances.\n    - Monitor web application logs and admin session activity for anomalies.\n    - Alert on suspicious XSS payloads or session hijacking attempts.\n    - CVE details and vendor advisories to be reviewed.\n\n- **WinRAR Zero-Day RCE (CVE-2025-6218) Active Attacks**\n  - What: Zero-day RCE exploited by multiple threat groups; added to CISA KEV catalog.\n  - Why: WinRAR widely used in enterprise environments; exploitation can lead to remote code execution.\n  - Actions:\n    - Ensure WinRAR updated to latest patched version.\n    - Monitor email gateways and endpoint logs for malicious archive extraction attempts.\n    - Hunt for exploitation attempts using archive-related execution or DLL side-loading.\n  \n- **Shai-Hulud 2.0 Supply Chain Attack Guidance**\n  - What: New supply chain attack variant targeting software dependencies.\n  - Why: Supply chain attacks can bypass perimeter defenses and impact multiple internal systems.\n  - Actions:\n    - Review and enhance software supply chain security posture.\n    - Monitor for anomalous build or deployment activity.\n    - Follow Microsoft’s detection and investigation guidance.\n\n- **SSH Brute Force Attacks from Eastern Europe**\n  - What: Over 20,000 SSH attacks in 24 hours from Romania, Netherlands, Germany.\n  - Why: High-volume brute force attempts increase risk of credential compromise on Linux/Unix servers.\n  - Actions:\n    - Review firewall and VPN logs for SSH brute force patterns.\n    - Enforce multi-factor authentication and IP blacklisting.\n    - Hunt for successful logins from suspicious geolocations.\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Log sources to prioritize:**\n  - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) – Windows telemetry, PowerShell logs, process creation.\n  - Email Security Gateway – malicious archive attachments, phishing attempts.\n  - Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Ivanti EPM logs – XSS payloads, admin session anomalies.\n  - Cloud platform logs – API access patterns, proxy tunneling, unusual lateral movement.\n  - VPN and Firewall logs – SSH brute force detection, suspicious IPs.\n  - Identity Providers (IdP) – unusual login patterns, session hijacking indicators.\n\n- **Hunting ideas (MITRE ATT&CK):**\n  - T1059.001 – PowerShell execution (Windows zero-days).\n  - T1190 – Exploit public-facing application (React2Shell, Ivanti EPM).\n  - T1078 – Valid accounts (SSH brute force).\n  - T1566 – Phishing (WinRAR exploitation via email).\n  - T1210 – Exploitation of remote services.\n  - T1071 – Application layer protocol (proxy tunneling with EtherRAT).\n  - T1550 – Use of stolen credentials or session hijacking.\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- Schedule patching cycles for all affected vendors: Microsoft, Ivanti, WinRAR, React server components, SAP.\n- Review and update supply chain security policies incorporating lessons from Shai-Hulud 2.0.\n- Conduct awareness training on phishing campaigns leveraging archive exploits and social engineering.\n- Evaluate and enhance Linux/Unix server hardening and monitoring in light of increased SSH brute force activity.\n- Investigate adoption of dependency-free scanning tools for npm/Yarn/pnpm/bun/deno projects to reduce supply chain risk.\n- Monitor developments in AI-related cyber risks and evolving ransomware TTPs for future SOC tuning.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Some CVE numbers were not explicitly provided; SOC should reference vendor advisories and patch notes for exact identifiers.",
