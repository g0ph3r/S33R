  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Multiple actively exploited vulnerabilities (Chrome 0‑day, React2Shell/CVE‑2025‑55182, WinRAR 0‑day, Microsoft/Outlook/PowerShell issues) require rapid patching and heightened monitoring, especially on user endpoints and Internet-facing web apps.\n- React2Shell exploitation is now clearly weaponized by APTs (including North Korea) and commodity actors to deploy RATs, miners, and Linux malware, giving direct paths from web frontends to internal APIs.\n- Critical infra/software used in enterprises (Fortinet cloud/SSO, Ivanti EPM, Splunk, Gemini Enterprise, Gogs, SAP) has fresh high‑impact flaws; SOC should verify exposure and watch for exploitation patterns.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Chrome 0‑day actively exploited (Google stable release)**\n  - What: Google patched a new Chrome zero‑day under active exploitation across Windows/Linux/macOS.\n  - Why it matters: High‑risk for drive‑by compromise via malicious websites; very relevant to staff browsing from corporate endpoints or VDI.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Confirm enterprise Chrome auto‑update enforced and > current fixed build; prioritize patch verification on high‑risk users (admins, trading, finance execs); increase scrutiny of EDR alerts from browser processes spawning unusual children (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, wscript.exe).\n\n- **React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑55182) – active exploitation by APTs & crimeware**\n  - What: Critical React Server Components vulnerability (“React2Shell”) is in CISA KEV and is being exploited in the wild to pivot into internal APIs and deploy EtherRAT, miners, and Linux malware (PeerBlight).\n  - Why it matters: Any Internet‑facing React/Next.js apps could provide direct access to internal APIs/data and serve as initial access for APTs (including DPRK) and crypto‑motivated actors.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Coordinate with app/platform teams to identify Internet‑facing React/Next.js apps and confirm patch/mitigation; add heightened monitoring for suspicious requests to those apps (anomalous HTTP methods, long query strings, path traversal, unexpected API calls) and for new outbound tunnels or RAT beacons from web servers.\n\n- **WinRAR 0‑day (CVE‑2025‑6218) & CISA KEV Windows flaws**\n  - What: WinRAR RCE vulnerability is under active attack by multiple threat groups; CISA also added new Windows/WinRAR flaws to KEV.\n  - Why it matters: Common phishing and post‑exploitation vector on user workstations and shared servers (weaponized archives via email or downloads).\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Verify WinRAR is either fully patched or removed/blocked on corporate endpoints; tighten email/web filtering for compressed attachments from external senders; hunt for recent execution of winrar.exe / unrar.exe followed by script interpreters (powershell/cscript) on endpoints not usually using compression tools.\n\n- **Microsoft December Patch Tuesday – multiple zero‑days + Outlook / PowerShell / Defender firewall issues**\n  - What: Microsoft fixed 50+ vulnerabilities including at least three zero‑days and critical issues in Outlook (remote code exec), PowerShell (0‑day RCE), Windows Defender Firewall (data disclosure), plus KEV‑listed Windows bugs.\n  - Why it matters: High chance of rapid weaponization; Outlook and PowerShell bugs can support phishing‑to‑RCE chains, bypassing existing mail controls; Defender firewall issue could aid lateral movement or data reconnaissance.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Confirm latest December patches are being deployed to all Windows servers and workstations with priority on Internet‑facing systems, Exchange/Outlook servers, management/bastion hosts, and domain controllers; raise alert sensitivity for abnormal PowerShell usage and Outlook child processes; monitor for spikes in exploit‑style suspicious events (blocked .dll loads, code injection, abnormal firewall rule changes).\n\n- **Network/security management appliances & monitoring tools (Fortinet, Ivanti EPM, Splunk, Gogs)**\n  - What: New critical auth‑bypass and RCE issues in FortiCloud/SSO and FortiSandbox, Ivanti EPM, Splunk Enterprise, and a Gogs zero‑day exploited in the wild.\n  - Why it matters: These systems have high privilege and network visibility; compromise = direct path to lateral movement, policy manipulation, and CI/CD abuse.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: With infra teams, rapidly inventory for exposed Fortinet cloud‑connected services, Ivanti EPM, Splunk Enterprise components, Gogs instances; ensure latest vendor patches are applied or systems isolated from the Internet; increase monitoring of management interfaces (VPN/WAF/firewall logs) for logins from unusual IPs, new admin accounts, or CLI/API changes done outside change windows.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Browser & document exploitation (Chrome 0‑day, WinRAR, Outlook RCE, Gemini Enterprise)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, endpoint Windows event logs, secure web gateway/proxy, email security, Google Workspace / M365 audit.\n  - Focus: Browser / Outlook / WinRAR / gemini.exe spawning scripts or LOLBins (PowerShell, cmd, wscript, mshta) (T1203, T1204); new browser extensions or add‑ins installed silently.\n\n- **React2Shell / web‑to‑internal API abuse**\n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs (Nginx/Apache/node), API gateway, container logs, Kubernetes ingress.\n  - Focus: Requests with unusual headers, encoded payloads, or template injection‑like patterns; excessive 4xx/5xx responses from specific IPs; spikes in calls from frontends to internal admin/debug APIs (T1190, T1195).\n\n- **APT and commodity malware using RATs and miners (EtherRAT, PeerBlight, Lumma/AMOS stealers)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, DNS, firewall, NDR/proxy.\n  - Focus: New binaries executed from temp/user profile/download paths; outbound C2‑style traffic (small, periodic HTTPS/WebSocket beacons to new FQDNs, especially dynamic DNS or newly registered domains) (T1059, T1105, T1027).\n\n- **Abuse of management and monitoring platforms (Fortinet, Ivanti EPM, Splunk, Gogs)**\n  - Log sources: Appliance audit logs, VPN logs, Splunk internal logs (_internal, _audit), web server/access logs.\n  - Focus: Logins from foreign or residential IPs; failed → successful admin logins; new API tokens or SSH keys; unexpected configuration exports, script deployments, or app updates (T1078, T1098, T1069).\n\n- **Windows post‑exploitation and PowerShell abuse (PowerShell 0‑day, Shai‑Hulud 2.0 guidance, general KEV Windows flaws)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Sysmon/Windows Security logs, AD logs.\n  - Focus: PowerShell with encoded commands or from Office/WinRAR/browser parent; script block logging with AMSI bypass patterns; new services or scheduled tasks created shortly after user logon (T1059.001, T1053, T1543).\n\n- **Cloud/AI SaaS abuse (Gemini Enterprise zero‑click, API gateway/BOLA vulnerabilities)**\n  - Log sources: Google Workspace / Gemini Enterprise logs, API gateway logs, IdP (SSO) logs.\n  - Focus: Access to large volumes of docs/mail/calendar from unusual geos/devices; anomalous token reuse; API calls enumerating objects or breaking normal user patterns (T1114, T1530).\n\n- **SSH and Linux attacks (20k SSH attacks, PeerBlight)**\n  - Log sources: Linux auth logs, SSH server logs, firewall/NDR.\n  - Focus: High‑volume SSH login attempts from single IP ranges; successful logins from new countries; SSH used as a tunnel (long‑lived sessions with high bandwidth) (T1110, T1572).\n\n- **Email and social delivery of stealers and fake updates (AMOS, Lumma, game update lures)**\n  - Log sources: Email gateway, proxy, EDR.\n  - Focus: Attachments or links advertising “updates,” “patches,” or “installers,” especially for games or AI/chat apps; ISO/ZIP archives with single executable; newly seen CHM or script attachments (T1566, T1204).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive React/Next.js exposure review**\n  - Work with development and architecture teams to catalog all React/Next.js apps (internal + Internet‑facing), ensure patching against React2Shell and related issues, and consider WAF rules/virtual patching where immediate code fixes are not feasible.\n\n- **Harden Windows & PowerShell usage baselines**\n  - Review and, where possible, enforce Constrained Language Mode, PowerShell logging (module, script block, transcription) and application control (AppLocker/WDAC) on high‑value systems; update detection content based on Microsoft’s Shai‑Hulud 2.0 and recent KEV guidance.\n\n- **Third‑party and admin tooling risk review (Fortinet, Ivanti, Splunk, Gogs, WinRAR)**\n  - Validate that these tools are minimized on endpoints, properly segmented, and restricted by admin‑only access; ensure vendor patch SLAs are met and that SOC has visibility into their audit logs by default.\n\n- **Cloud/AI SaaS governance (Gemini Enterprise, AI browsers, MCP/LLM integrations)**\n  - Coordinate with cloud security and data protection teams to define policies for AI assistant data exposure, logging requirements, and acceptable use; ensure AI‑related services are integrated into central logging and DLP.\n\n- **Ransomware and data‑theft playbook refresh**\n  - Update runbooks to incorporate latest TTPs from new Rust‑based ransomware (01flip) and current FinCEN/sector reports; rehearse rapid isolation and negotiation‑support procedures adapted for financial‑sector regulatory timelines.\n\n- **User awareness refresh on malicious archives and “updates”**\n  - Plan a short awareness push focused on malicious archives, fake update installers (games, AI tools, “ChatGPT plugins”), and safe handling of compressed email attachments, aligning with the WinRAR and stealer campaigns.",
