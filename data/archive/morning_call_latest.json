  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and a Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter 0‑day highlights immediate risk to Internet-facing apps and Windows endpoints.\n- Ransomware activity remains high (new VolkLocker ransomware, sector trend reports), with continued focus on exploiting misconfigurations and unpatched systems.\n- Identity and cloud security (AD → Entra ID migration, cloud file sharing/link-based access) remain key attack surfaces, especially for phishing-driven and lateral movement campaigns.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) actively exploited in the wild**\n  - What happened: Multiple threat actors are exploiting the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) affecting React-based web applications and services (incl. in cloud environments).\n  - Why it matters operationally: Potential for remote code execution on Internet-facing apps or internal portals, giving initial foothold for data theft and ransomware staging.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Coordinate with app/cloud teams to identify any exposed React/JavaScript-fronted apps possibly impacted; raise priority on monitoring for anomalous HTTP POSTs, webshell-like behavior, and unexpected outbound connections from web servers; flag any suspicious activity on React-based apps as P1 for triage.\n\n- **Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter 0‑day (CISA warning)**\n  - What happened: CISA warns of a Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter driver vulnerability being exploited in the wild (privilege escalation on Windows).\n  - Why it matters operationally: Enables local privilege escalation from user to SYSTEM, turning low-level compromises (phishing, browser/Office exploit) into full host takeover and ransomware deployment.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Validate if our Windows baseline includes this vulnerable driver version; add hunts for unusual driver loading, new kernel-mode components, and high-integrity processes spawned from low-privilege user contexts; escalate any chain of user‑level malware followed by rapid privilege escalation.\n\n- **Ransomware activity & VolkLocker development**\n  - What happened: New VolkLocker ransomware analyzed; hard-coded master key allows free decryption; other reporting shows manufacturing as a testbed for evolving ransomware tactics.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Demonstrates ongoing experimentation by ransomware actors and emphasizes need for fast detection and containment rather than relying on decryption luck.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Ensure all current ransomware playbooks are accessible and ready; double-check EDR alerting on mass file modifications, shadow copy deletion, and backup tampering; treat any newly observed file-encrypting behavior as an immediate containment event and verify if publicly available decryptors apply before considering ransom scenarios.\n\n- **React2Shell & cloud/IDP exposure (Google Cloud / UpGuard write‑ups)**\n  - What happened: Cloud-focused write-ups stress multiple actors targeting React2Shell within cloud environments and SaaS workloads.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Financial services often expose customer portals/APIs via public cloud; exploitation can bypass perimeter defenses and pivot into internal data or credentials.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Review WAF and cloud load-balancer logs for anomalies on React/SPA endpoints; increase scrutiny of cloud audit logs (GCP/Azure/AWS) for unexpected account creations, permission changes, or service account key generation linked to these apps.\n\n- **AD → Entra ID identity migration risks**\n  - What happened: Microsoft guidance on converting user SOA and identities from on‑prem AD to Entra ID is being highlighted.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Misconfigurations during hybrid identity or migration (over-privileged service accounts, mis‑scoped sync, weak conditional access) are prime targets for account takeover and ransomware operators.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Confirm with identity team whether any current AD/Entra migration is in progress; if yes, tighten monitoring for new global admin assignments, legacy auth usage, and new app registrations/service principals with broad permissions; escalate any anomalous sign‑in to high‑privileged Entra roles.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Web apps / React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)**\n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs, reverse proxies, cloud load balancers; EDR on web servers; cloud audit logs.\n  - Focus today (T1190, T1059, T1505): Hunt for unusual HTTP requests to React/SPA endpoints (unexpected methods, long/encoded parameters), new process spawns (cmd/powershell/bash/node) from web server processes, and new/modified JS/PHP/ASP/Node files in web roots.\n\n- **Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter 0‑day & local privilege escalation**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Security & System logs, Sysmon if available.\n  - Focus (T1068, T1069, T1078): Alert on low-privilege processes spawning high‑integrity child processes (e.g., Office/Browser → cmd/powershell → SYSTEM service), new or unsigned drivers, and token manipulation or UAC bypass behavior shortly after initial phishing events.\n\n- **Ransomware behaviors (VolkLocker + general trends)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, file servers, backup platforms, Windows event logs.\n  - Focus (T1486, T1490): Detect rapid file rename/encryption patterns, creation of ransom notes across many directories, use of vssadmin/wmic/powershell to delete shadow copies, and abnormal shutdown/stop commands against backup or AV services.\n\n- **Phishing and cloud file/link abuse**\n  - Log sources: Email security gateway, M365/Google Workspace logs, proxy/DNS, endpoint browsers.\n  - Focus (T1566, T1204, T1567): Look for emails with cloud-sharing links (OneDrive/SharePoint/Google Drive/etc.) from newly seen senders, links redirecting to credential-harvesting pages, and OAuth consent prompts to untrusted apps; monitor unusual file downloads followed by macro/script execution.\n\n- **Identity and Entra ID / IdP**\n  - Log sources: Entra ID / IdP sign-in and audit logs, conditional access, on‑prem AD logs.\n  - Focus (T1078, T1098, T1136): Hunt for impossible travel, atypical MFA failures, new app registrations, newly granted high-privilege roles, and changes to conditional access or MFA policies, especially linked to admin accounts or migration activities.\n\n- **Data theft and exfil, especially via cloud and “link sharing”**\n  - Log sources: DLP, CASB, cloud storage logs (SharePoint/OneDrive/Box/GDrive), proxies.\n  - Focus (T1537, T1567): Monitor for mass file downloads, public link creation for sensitive repositories, sudden spikes in sharing to external domains, and anomalous large uploads to unapproved cloud services.\n\n- **Dark web / Breach Forums re‑emergence**\n  - Log sources: Threat intel feeds, credential monitoring services.\n  - Focus (T1589, T1585, T1110): Cross-check newly reported credential dumps or “banking/finance” data sales with our domains and known user lists; feed any hits into targeted password reset and investigation.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patch & harden for React2Shell and related web stack issues**\n  - Ensure dev/app teams apply vendor fixes or mitigations for CVE-2025-55182; review secure headers, WAF rules, and input validation; consider code-level review for affected apps.\n\n- **Windows hardening and 0‑day response process**\n  - Incorporate the Cloud Files Mini Filter case into a broader Windows hardening review (driver allowlisting, EDR tamper protection, LSASS protections); test our fast‑track response for Windows 0‑days.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop & backup resilience**\n  - Run a short ransomware tabletop focusing on fast containment and communications; validate that critical backups are offline/immutable and restoration times are acceptable for key financial systems.\n\n- **Identity governance & AD/Entra hygiene**\n  - Work with IAM teams to review privileged role assignments, service account scopes, legacy protocols, and conditional access; codify monitoring requirements into standard baselines for any future migrations.\n\n- **Security awareness: phishing & cloud link usage**\n  - Update awareness content to emphasize risks of cloud-sharing links, OAuth consent screens, and “trusted-looking” internal-looking emails; align with news of real-world phishing that bypassed users.\n\n- **Threat hunting content refresh**\n  - Integrate current ransomware TTPs, React2Shell patterns, and Windows 0‑day exploitation behaviors into our hunting playbooks; schedule a focused hunt sprint in the next 1–2 weeks.",
