  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- Active exploitation of **React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)** in React Server Components/Next.js is delivering multiple malware families (incl. NK-linked EtherRAT, Linux PeerBlight). Any exposed React/Next frontends that proxy to internal APIs are at risk.\n- **Ivanti EPM** and **Fortinet FortiCloud/FortiSandbox** disclosed critical vulnerabilities (RCE, auth bypass, OS command injection) with many systems exposed online; exploitation is expected.\n- **WinRAR CVE-2025-6218**, other Microsoft Windows/Outlook/PowerShell flaws, and a **Windows Defender Firewall data disclosure bug** are now in CISA KEV / confirmed actively exploited. Patch Tuesday shipped fixes for three Windows zero‑days.\n- **Google Gemini Enterprise zero-click flaw** briefly allowed access to Gmail/Calendar/Docs via Gemini; patches are out, but we should review access logs for anomalous AI-assistant use against corporate Google tenants.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n#### 1. React2Shell – Critical React Server Components / Next.js vuln under active exploitation (NK APT, miners, RATs)\n\n- **What happened**\n  - Critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182, “React2Shell”) in React Server Components/Next.js now:\n    - Added to **CISA KEV**.\n    - Confirmed **active exploitation** across sectors.\n    - Used by North Korean actors to deploy **EtherRAT** and by others for **crypto miners** and **PeerBlight Linux proxy malware**.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Many modern customer‑facing and internal portals in financials use React/Next.\n  - Exploit can turn frontend into a **pivot into internal APIs/services**, enabling data exfiltration, account takeover, and malware deployment.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Scoping**\n    - Confirm with app/platform teams: do we run **React Server Components / Next.js** in any internet‑facing or partner‑facing apps? Are we using affected versions?\n  - **Patching / mitigation (coordinate, track)**\n    - Ensure vulnerable apps are **upgraded to vendor-patched versions** and/or **server-side mitigations** are applied (per Unit42, Salt Security, HackTheBox guidance).\n  - **Detection / hunting**\n    - **Web/proxy/WAF logs**:\n      - Hunt for unusual requests against React/Next apps: odd query strings, template injection-like payloads, anomalous headers, and spikes in 500/4xx errors.\n      - Look for requests to API endpoints via app that differ from normal (new methods/parameters).\n    - **EDR/host logs** on web servers/containers:\n      - New processes spawned by node/pm2/nginx, unexpected shells, curl/wget, or crypto-miner binaries.\n    - Watch for **outbound C2-like** traffic from webfronts (MITRE: T1071, T1090).\n  - **Containment**\n    - For any suspiciously behaving frontend, be ready to:\n      - Remove from internet, rotate secrets (API keys, DB creds), and review adjacent internal APIs for abuse.\n    - Coordinate with threat intel for any **IOCs from EtherRAT/PeerBlight** vendor reports.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) – Critical RCE / session hijack (stored XSS)\n\n- **What happened**\n  - New **critical Ivanti EPM vulnerability** enabling **admin session hijacking and possible RCE** via stored XSS (multiple reports, CVE this week).\n  - Internet scans show **hundreds of Ivanti EPM systems exposed**.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - EPM is a **central enterprise management tool**; compromise = **domain-wide code execution** and lateral movement.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Asset check**\n    - Confirm whether we or key vendors/MSPs run **Ivanti EPM**; identify exposed management consoles.\n  - **Patch/mitigation**\n    - Ensure latest Ivanti EPM patches are **applied immediately**, especially to internet-facing consoles.\n    - If patching is delayed, restrict console access via **VPN-only / IP allowlists**.\n  - **Detection / hunting**\n    - **Web/IdP logs**:\n      - Look for anomalous admin logins, especially from unusual IPs, countries, or at odd hours.\n      - Multiple failed logins followed by success for high-privilege EPM accounts.\n    - **EPM server logs**:\n      - Unexpected changes to packages, tasks, or agent deployment jobs (MITRE: T1484, T1059).\n    - **EDR**:\n      - Unusual processes spawned from EPM services (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe across many endpoints in short time).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Fortinet – FortiCloud SSO auth bypass & FortiSandbox OS command injection\n\n- **What happened**\n  - Fortinet released fixes for **two critical authentication-bypass issues in FortiCloud SSO** and a **FortiSandbox OS command injection** bug.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Fortinet gear is commonly used in financials; auth bypass on SSO or RCE on sandbox can lead to **network compromise** and manipulation of threat analysis results (hiding malware).\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Inventory**\n    - Check if we use **FortiCloud SSO**, **FortiSandbox**, or any related Fortinet SaaS services.\n  - **Patch / config**\n    - Coordinate with network team to **apply Fortinet patches immediately** or enable any recommended workarounds.\n    - Restrict management plane interfaces to **admin segments/VPN**, not open internet.\n  - **Monitoring**\n    - **Firewall / VPN logs**:\n      - Suspicious logins to FortiCloud / admin interfaces from unfamiliar IPs.\n    - **FortiSandbox logs**:\n      - Unexpected system commands or scripts initiated by the sandbox engine.\n    - Look for configuration changes or newly created admin accounts on Fortinet devices (MITRE: T1098).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. WinRAR CVE-2025-6218 & CISA KEV additions (Windows & WinRAR flaws under active attack)\n\n- **What happened**\n  - WinRAR **CVE-2025-6218** is under **active exploitation** by multiple threat groups; added to **CISA KEV**, along with several **Windows vulnerabilities**.\n  - Exploitation is typically via **malicious archives** delivered by email or web.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Many users, including in finance, still install WinRAR or compatible tools.\n  - Common vector for **initial access** by crimeware and APT (MITRE: T1204, T1566).\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Policy / exposure check**\n    - Validate if WinRAR is **allowed** in environment; if so, check versions and push upgrade to **patched versions**.\n    - If unsupported, consider blocking WinRAR via **application control**.\n  - **Email / web monitoring**\n    - Increase scrutiny of **archive attachments** (.rar, .zip, .7z) from unsolicited senders.\n    - Tune email gateways to **auto-sandbox all archives** from external sources.\n  - **Hunting**\n    - EDR: search for **WinRAR execution** (winrar.exe, unrar.exe) followed by:\n      - Dropping/starting atypical binaries or PowerShell.\n      - Process chains from mail client → WinRAR → script/binary.\n    - Proxy logs: downloads of **RAR files** from newly seen or low-reputation domains.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Microsoft December 2025 Patch Tuesday – 3 zero-days + Windows Defender Firewall & Outlook flaws\n\n- **What happened**\n  - Microsoft released December patches fixing **56+ vulnerabilities**, including:\n    - **Three zero-days** (one actively exploited hijacking Windows devices).\n    - Vulnerabilities in **Outlook**, **PowerShell (0-day)**, **Windows Defender Firewall service (data disclosure)**.\n    - CISA added several **Windows flaws** to KEV.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - These bugs are in **core Windows client/server and Outlook**, widely used in our environment, and are already exploited.\n  - Outlook and PowerShell bugs are ideal for **phishing-to-RCE** and **post-exploitation**.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Patch prioritization**\n    - Ensure December Patch Tuesday roll-out is **fast-tracked** for:\n      - Exposed servers (RDS, Exchange, IIS, DCs) and all **Outlook-heavy user groups** (finance, execs, traders).\n    - Confirm **PowerShell** and **Windows Defender Firewall service** components are updated.\n  - **Monitoring / hunting**\n    - **Email logs**:\n      - Look for **suspicious Outlook message properties** or malformed content linked to exploitation attempts (per MS guidance).\n    - **EDR / PowerShell logs**:\n      - Hunt for PowerShell execution with unusual parameters, encoded commands, or spawned from Outlook, browser, or Office (MITRE: T1059.001).\n    - **Windows Defender / firewall logs**:\n      - Unusual access patterns or attempts to query internal firewall configuration that may indicate data disclosure probing.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Google Gemini Enterprise – Zero-click data exposure into Gmail/Calendar/Docs (now patched)\n\n- **What happened**\n  - Google patched a **zero-click vulnerability in Gemini Enterprise** that could expose **corporate data** from Gmail, Calendar, Docs etc., when accessed via Gemini.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - If we use **Google Workspace + Gemini Enterprise** (or if third parties with our data do), attackers may have been able to access documents and emails via the assistant.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Scope**\n    - Confirm whether our organization (or critical vendors) use **Gemini Enterprise** integrated with Workspace.\n  - **Review logs**\n    - Check **Google Workspace audit / Gemini access logs** (if available) for:\n      - Anomalous Gemini queries by service accounts or from unusual IPs.\n      - Access to large volumes of documents or mail in short time windows (MITRE: T1114, T1530).\n  - **Awareness**\n    - Remind staff not to paste **sensitive internal data** into AI tools beyond approved use-cases and tenants.\n\n---\n\n#### 7.
