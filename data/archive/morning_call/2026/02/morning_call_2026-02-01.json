  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- New Kerberos relay attack vector (CVE-2026-20929) using DNS CNAME abuse poses lateral-movement risk in AD environments.\n- eScan antivirus supply-chain compromise shows that “trusted” security tools can deliver malware; reinforces need for strict EDR/AV control and telemetry.\n- SCADA/ICS DoS flaw highlighted; while we’re not an industrial operator, the pattern reinforces availability-focused monitoring for any OT-like or critical back-end systems.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n**1. Kerberos Authentication Relay via CNAME Abuse (CVE-2026-20929) – AD Lateral Movement Risk**  \n- What happened: New Kerberos relay technique abusing DNS CNAME records to route auth traffic and relay Kerberos tickets.  \n- Why it matters operationally: Enables domain lateral movement / privilege escalation without obvious password theft; can bypass some SPN-based protections (T1557, T1550.003).  \n- Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n  - Hunt for unusual Kerberos service tickets (TGS-REQ) to unexpected SPNs or hosts, and spikes in failed Kerberos auth from single endpoints (SIEM/AD logs).  \n  - Check DNS logs for high CNAME lookup volume or new CNAMEs pointing to internal AD-integrated services; escalate any ad‑hoc DNS changes affecting Kerberos-relevant names.\n\n**2. eScan Antivirus Supply-Chain Attack – “Security Tool as Malware Delivery”**  \n- What happened: eScan AV was reportedly abused in a supply-chain incident to deliver malware instead of protection.  \n- Why it matters operationally: Demonstrates that endpoint “security” agents can be abused as high-trust malware installers and may bypass allowlists (T1195, T1199, T1105).  \n- Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n  - Confirm we do not use eScan; if any instance appears in inventory or EDR, treat as high-risk and investigate processes, child processes, and network connections from that agent.  \n  - Tighten monitoring around all AV/EDR/updater processes: alert on them launching scripting engines (powershell, wscript, bash), cmd.exe, or unexpected network destinations.\n\n**3. SCADA / ICS DoS Vulnerability (Service-Impacting Availability Attacks)**  \n- What happened: Reported SCADA flaws allow remote DoS, impacting availability of affected industrial systems.  \n- Why it matters operationally: Pattern of easy remotely-triggered DoS is relevant to any critical back-end where availability is key (payments, trading, ATM/branch connectivity).  \n- Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n  - Review firewall/WAF rules for externally exposed management/OT-style interfaces; ensure rate limiting and blocking of malformed/probing traffic where possible.  \n  - Establish alerts for unusual spikes in traffic or error rates to critical internal services that could indicate DoS-style behavior; coordinate with NOC for joint triage.\n\n**4. Moltbook AI SaaS Leak – Tokens, API Keys, Email Exposure**  \n- What happened: Vulnerability in an AI SaaS platform leaked email addresses, login tokens, and API keys.  \n- Why it matters operationally: Similar AI/SaaS tools used by staff could leak corporate accounts or API credentials, enabling account takeover and data access (T1078, T1552).  \n- Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n  - Search corporate SSO and proxy logs for access to Moltbook or similar unapproved AI tools; flag any use from sensitive accounts and notify security engineering.  \n  - Monitor IdP for unusual logins/API key usage tied to AI-related SaaS; be prepared to force re-auth and revoke tokens if any affected service is confirmed in our environment.\n\n**5. RAMP Ransomware Forum Disruption (Law Enforcement Takedown)**  \n- What happened: FBI reportedly took the RAMP ransomware forum offline.  \n- Why it matters operationally: Affiliates may scatter to other forums, change TTPs, or accelerate ongoing operations; short-term turbulence can mean noisy or opportunistic attacks.  \n- Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n  - Maintain heightened monitoring for typical ransomware precursors: new C2 beacons, LSASS access, mass encryption-like I/O, and shadow copy deletion on servers/endpoints.  \n  - Re-validate rapid containment playbooks (EDR isolation, SMB blocklists, DC protection) and ensure on-duty staff know escalation paths for suspected ransomware activity.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Kerberos CNAME Relay (CVE-2026-20929)**  \n  - Log sources: AD security logs (4768/4769/4771/4776), DNS logs, EDR on domain-joined systems.  \n  - Hunt for: TGS requests for unusual SPNs, sudden change in Kerberos auth patterns from non-DC hosts, DNS CNAME queries for internal service names (T1557, T1550.003).\n\n- **Supply-chain via Security Tools (eScan case)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, endpoint application inventory, sysmon, proxy/DNS.  \n  - Hunt for: AV/EDR/updater processes spawning shells/scripting (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, /bin/bash), or making outbound connections to non-vendor domains (T1204, T1105).\n\n- **Potential DoS / Service Exhaustion (SCADA-style issues generalized)**  \n  - Log sources: Firewall, load balancers, WAF, API gateways, application logs.  \n  - Hunt for: Sudden spikes in requests from few IPs, malformed protocol traffic, repeated failures or 5xx errors against payment/banking APIs (T1498).\n\n- **Credential & Token Abuse from SaaS/AI Leaks (Moltbook theme)**  \n  - Log sources: IdP/SSO (Okta/AAD), CASB, VPN, email, cloud audit logs.  \n  - Hunt for: Logins from new geo/ASN right after AI/SaaS access, impossible travel, abnormal token creation/use, and API key use from previously unseen IPs (T1078, T1552).\n\n- **Ransomware Precursors Post-RAMP Takedown**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows event logs, backup systems, file servers.  \n  - Hunt for: Discovery (net.exe, nltest, adfind), credential access (lsass dumps, mimikatz-like signatures), mass file renames, vssadmin/WMIC shadow copy deletion (T1486, T1047).\n\n- **Malware on Android / Mobile (StopLamers investigation)**  \n  - Log sources: MDM/EMM, mobile security tools, VPN logs.  \n  - Hunt for: New or sideloaded APKs on managed devices, unusual always-on VPN sessions originating from mobile clients, anomalous DNS to known free-DNS/dynamic DNS providers.\n\n- **Data Breach / PII Exposure Themes (various leaks & settlements)**  \n  - Log sources: DLP, email gateways, file shares, cloud storage logs.  \n  - Hunt for: Bulk PII exports (spreadsheets, DB dumps), uploads to personal cloud, or mass emailing to external recipients with attachments (T1567.002).\n\n- **AI Agent Social Engineering / “Compressed Alignment” Attacks**  \n  - Log sources: Developer platforms, AI proxy/gateway logs (if any), web proxy.  \n  - Hunt for: Automated or scripted interactions with external AI endpoints from servers; unusual outbound POSTs carrying large prompts or code/data blobs.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Kerberos & DNS Hardening for CVE-2026-20929**  \n  - Security engineering to review Microsoft guidance when fully available; assess constrained delegation, SPN hygiene, DNS change control, and potential CNAME restrictions.\n\n- **Vendor & Toolchain Risk Review (eScan case)**  \n  - Reassess trust model for AV/EDR and other agents: verify supply-chain security posture of current vendors; ensure all update channels are TLS-validated and pinned where possible.\n\n- **Shadow IT & AI/SaaS Usage Governance (Moltbook & AI agent topics)**  \n  - Improve discovery and approval process for AI/SaaS tools; enforce SSO where possible; implement CASB controls and user awareness on API key handling and data sharing.\n\n- **Ransomware Readiness Posture Check (RAMP context)**  \n  - Validate backups (immutability and restore times), privileged access management, and segmentation; conduct a tabletop exercise simulating affiliate-style ransomware intrusion.\n\n- **OT/ICS & Critical Service Availability Risk**  \n  - Even without SCADA, map all systems where availability equals direct financial impact (payments, ATM networks, trading); coordinate with infra teams on DoS protection, redundancy, and monitoring baselines.\n\n- **Breach & Regulatory Exposure Learnings (Comcast/Citrix Bleed, RINA, journalist data leak)**  \n  - Use these cases to reassess our own incident notification, legal/regulatory coordination, and settlement-risk exposure; ensure data classification and retention policies are enforced and auditable.",
