  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation spikes observed against Adobe ColdFusion and unpatched internet-facing services; prioritize perimeter reviews and virtual patching.  \n- New HardBit 4.0 ransomware evolution and botnet/C2 tooling (RondoDox + C2 framework) highlight increasing sophistication in post-compromise operations.  \n- New GlassWorm macOS malware wave targeting crypto wallets underscores risk to trading/treasury teams using Macs or personal devices.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Adobe ColdFusion exploitation surge (SecurityAffairs – Christmas attacks)**\n  - What: Thousands of exploit attempts against ColdFusion instances observed globally over the holidays.  \n  - Why it matters: Any exposed CF-based app (legacy portals, internal tools moved to DMZ) is at high risk for RCE and data theft.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm whether we or key vendors run ColdFusion externally; if yes, urgently validate patch level and WAF coverage.  \n    - Add / tighten rules in WAF/IDS for ColdFusion exploit patterns; review past 14 days of WAF/HTTP logs for anomalous CF requests & web shells.\n\n- **RondoDox botnet using React2Shell to hijack unpatched devices (HackRead)**\n  - What: New botnet exploiting “React2Shell” in internet-facing devices/apps to conscript thousands of systems.  \n  - Why it matters: Compromised edge devices can be used as DDoS pivot, proxy for data exfiltration, or stepping-stone into internal networks.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Identify any devices/apps we run that match “React/Node-based” stacks mentioned in the article; verify patch/firmware status and external exposure.  \n    - Hunt in firewall/IDS logs for scanning/exploitation towards those services and unusual outbound C2-like connections from network appliances.\n\n- **HardBit 4.0 ransomware evolution (r/netsec, r/cybersecurity)**\n  - What: New version of HardBit ransomware with updated negotiation tactics and likely improved payload/evasion.  \n  - Why it matters: Financial sector remains a prime target; HardBit’s negotiation pressure and data-theft model may change impact profile and dwell time.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Ensure EDR and email filters are using latest ransomware and HardBit-related rules; check anti-ransomware policies are in “block” mode.  \n    - Run quick hunts for recent suspicious archive/script downloads and mass file renames or shadow copy deletion (last 7 days) on servers and endpoints.\n\n- **GlassWorm macOS malware targeting trojanized crypto wallets (r/cybersecurity)**\n  - What: New GlassWorm wave on macOS via trojanized crypto wallet apps.  \n  - Why it matters: Risk to staff dealing with digital assets/trading, and to BYOD/macOS endpoints used for work access (credential theft, lateral movement).  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Work with IT to verify that only approved wallet/trading software is allowed on corporate Macs; check MDM compliance & EDR coverage on all managed Macs.  \n    - Hunt for unapproved wallet executables, new unsigned apps, and unusual outbound connections from macOS hosts to newly-registered domains.\n\n- **Increased attacker focus on C2/botnet frameworks (RondoDox + C2 framework article)**\n  - What: RondoDox botnet and a public “C2 framework in modern C++23” tutorial highlight easier access to custom C2.  \n  - Why it matters: Expect more bespoke C2 patterns that evade static signatures and use legit protocols/infrastructure.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Tighten anomaly-based detections in proxy/NDR for rare destinations, unusual TLS fingerprints, and low-volume persistent beacons.  \n    - Validate that EDR detections for process injection, LOLBins (PowerShell, MSHTA, curl, certutil, bash), and unsigned binaries are enabled and not overly suppressed.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **ColdFusion & web app exploitation (item 13) – Initial Access / Web Shells (T1190, T1505.003)**  \n  - Review web server/WAF logs for: unusual POSTs to CFAdmin, upload endpoints, or .cfm files; spikes in 404/500 around ColdFusion paths.  \n  - Hunt for new or modified files in webroots (especially .cfm, .jsp, .php, .aspx) and suspicious child processes spawned by web server accounts.\n\n- **RondoDox / React2Shell – Edge device compromise & botnet C2 (T1133, T1071)**  \n  - Monitor firewall, NDR, and appliance logs for: outbound connections from routers, load balancers, or “should-be-quiet” devices to rare external IPs/ports.  \n  - Flag repeated HTTP(S) requests with unusual user agents or paths tied to React2Shell POCs (Regex-like scanning, atypical API endpoints).\n\n- **HardBit 4.0 ransomware – Execution & Impact (T1059, T1486, T1490)**  \n  - EDR: alert on mass file renames, rapid file writes with ransomware-like extensions, vssadmin / wbadmin / bcdedit usage, and shutdown of AV/backup services.  \n  - SIEM: correlate privilege-escalation events + new local admin creation + subsequent file encryption on file servers.\n\n- **macOS GlassWorm – Credential/Wallet theft & C2 (T1555, T1105)**  \n  - On macOS logs/EDR: detect new unsigned apps, quarantine events, and requests for keychain access from non-standard wallet/trading apps.  \n  - Proxy/DNS: look for macOS hosts reaching newly-registered domains, dynamic DNS, or crypto-related domains not in allowlists.\n\n- **Custom C2 & C2 framework trends (item 15) – Command & Control (T1071, T1090, T1571)**  \n  - NDR/proxy: hunt for long-lived, low-volume HTTPS sessions to single IPs, uncommon TLS cipher suites, or SNI mismatch (no SNI / IP-only).  \n  - SIEM: create baseline for per-host external connection patterns and alert on new rare destinations or protocol/port combinations.\n\n- **Ransomware negotiations & extortion patterns (item 1) – Data theft & exfil (T1041, T1567)**  \n  - Monitor egress for large data transfers to cloud storage, file-sharing, or TOR-exit-like IPs from non-backup servers.  \n  - Watch for archiving commands (7z, rar, tar, zip) on servers followed by outbound uploads.\n\n- **OT/critical infrastructure cyber-offense signal (Venezuela blackout article) – Lateral movement (T1021, T1040)**  \n  - For any connections to utilities/market infrastructure partners, monitor for anomalous RDP/SSH/VPN use outside normal schedules and geos.  \n  - Enhance alerts on new VPN device fingerprints or MFA anomalies for privileged accounts with infra/OT access.\n\n- **Data breach / honeypot discussions (ShinyHunters vs. Resecurity) – Credential theft use (T1078)**  \n  - Monitor for use of valid but anomalous credentials: impossible travel, unusual device fingerprints, logins from new ASNs to high-privilege accounts.  \n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- Coordinate with asset management to positively confirm whether any ColdFusion or React/Node-based externally exposed apps exist; if yes, schedule formal code review and patch/hardening plan.  \n\n- Review ransomware playbooks (including HardBit-like double extortion) with IR and legal: negotiation stance, data disclosure scenarios, and decision trees should be up to date.  \n\n- Strengthen macOS security baseline: enforce MDM on all corporate Macs, restrict unsigned apps, and define approved list for any wallet/trading tools used by finance teams.  \n\n- Enhance C2/botnet detection capability: evaluate or tune NDR/behavioral analytics for beaconing patterns, TLS fingerprinting, and anomalous DNS use.  \n\n- Update third-party risk questionnaires to explicitly ask critical vendors about ColdFusion usage, patch status, and exposure of legacy web tech.  \n\n- Incorporate recent botnet and ransomware TTPs (HardBit 4.0, RondoDox, GlassWorm) into purple-team exercises and tabletop scenarios for Q1.",
