  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Cisco Secure Email zero-day is being exploited in the wild; email perimeter devices may be directly targetable and leveraged for phishing and data theft.\n- CISA has added a WatchGuard Fireware OS flaw to the KEV catalog, implying active exploitation of perimeter firewalls.\n- Recent extortion/ransomware and ATM jackpotting cases underscore continued financial-sector targeting and abuse of insiders and trusted professionals.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cisco Secure Email zero‑day actively exploited**\n  - What: ~100+ Cisco Secure Email gateways reportedly exposed and exploited via an undisclosed zero‑day.\n  - Why: Compromised secure email gateways can be used to bypass anti-phishing controls, exfiltrate mail, or pivot into internal networks.\n  - Actions:  \n    - Identify if we run Cisco Secure Email/SMA/ESA; if yes, validate versions against Cisco advisories and ensure temporary mitigations are applied.  \n    - Increase monitoring of email gateway logs for anomalous admin logins, config changes, or malicious relaying; consider temporary geo/IP restrictions for admin interfaces.\n\n- **WatchGuard Fireware OS flaw added to CISA KEV**\n  - What: CISA added a vulnerability in WatchGuard Fireware OS to KEV, indicating confirmed exploitation in the wild.\n  - Why: WatchGuard devices are often internet-facing; compromise would give attackers network foothold and VPN/firewall control.\n  - Actions:  \n    - Confirm inventory of any WatchGuard devices (including subsidiaries/partners) and check against KEV details; ensure emergency patching or mitigations.  \n    - Monitor VPN and firewall logs for suspicious configuration changes, new admin accounts, and anomalous remote access from unusual locations.\n\n- **Windows-targeting campaigns via weaponized SVG and Office files**\n  - What: Report of attackers weaponizing SVG files and Office documents to deliver malware to Windows users.\n  - Why: Bypasses user expectations (image/doc files) and can evade some traditional content filters; high relevance for email and web vectors in financial users.\n  - Actions:  \n    - Tighten email and web filtering for SVG and macro-enabled Office attachments; enforce sandboxing and block or heavily scrutinize atypical file types.  \n    - Run targeted hunts in EDR for recent Office/Browser processes spawning scripting engines (wscript, powershell, mshta, cmd) and suspicious child processes.\n\n- **ATM jackpotting scheme using Ploutus malware (financial threat)**\n  - What: DOJ charged 54 individuals over ATM jackpotting with Ploutus malware.\n  - Why: Confirms sustained criminal capability and TTPs against ATMs and potentially other payment terminals; risk for any directly or indirectly managed ATM fleet.\n  - Actions:  \n    - Coordinate with ATM ops to verify current hardening: USB/port locks, whitelisting, secure boot, logging to central SIEM.  \n    - Monitor for any endpoints/servers communicating with ATMs running unsigned binaries, remote admin tools, or abnormal ATM management commands.\n\n- **Ransomware/extortion trends and insider involvement**\n  - What: Reports of cybersecurity professionals pleading guilty for involvement in ransomware, plus large-scale extortion via stolen user data.\n  - Why: Confirms ongoing extortion focus on sensitive data and risk from technically skilled insiders and contractors.\n  - Actions:  \n    - Recheck access logs for privileged accounts (admins, SOC, contractors) for off-hours or anomalous data access/downloads.  \n    - Emphasize strict MFA, just‑in‑time access, and alerting on large data exports from key file shares and databases.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Email & web gateways (Cisco Secure Email, SVG/Office malware) – ATT&CK T1566, T1204**\n  - Inspect logs for unusual attachment types (SVG, .hta, .lnk, macro-enabled docs), high volume of blocked or sandboxed emails, and spikes in URL rewrites or clicks from internal users.\n\n- **EDR/Endpoint telemetry – ATT&CK T1059, T1203, T1105**\n  - Hunt for Office, browser, and image viewer processes spawning cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, mshta.exe, or unusual DLL loads shortly after file-open events.\n\n- **Firewall/VPN/WatchGuard and other perimeter devices – ATT&CK T1190, T1133**\n  - Review admin login attempts from new geos, repeated failed logins, unexpected configuration changes, new VPN user creation, and firmware upgrade events occurring outside change windows.\n\n- **Privileged account and insider monitoring – ATT&CK T1078, T1552, T1530**\n  - Monitor SIEM/IdP for anomalous privileged logins (new device, geo, time), sudden expansion of group memberships, and large file or DB export operations by admins or SOC users.\n\n- **ATM/Payment infrastructure logs – ATT&CK T1068, T1072**\n  - For any directly managed ATMs: track console access, software installs, USB events, remote management sessions, and cash dispense anomalies vs. customer transaction logs.\n\n- **Data exfiltration / extortion behaviors – ATT&CK T1041, T1567**\n  - Alert on large outbound transfers (HTTPS, SFTP, cloud storage, personal email) from servers holding customer or transaction data; correlate with new or unusual tools (7zip, rar, rsync).\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS access (in light of extortion and AI/SaaS use) – ATT&CK T1528**\n  - Monitor sign-ins and activity for corporate accounts on major SaaS platforms for unusual locations, mass download, or “export all data” actions.\n\n- **DNS and proxy logs (command & control) – ATT&CK T1071, T1090**\n  - Look for newly observed domains shortly after users open SVG/Office attachments, DNS tunneling patterns, or HTTP(S) traffic to domains with low reputation or newly registered status.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- Validate with asset management and network teams whether Cisco Secure Email or WatchGuard devices are in use anywhere in the organization or subsidiaries; document ownership and patch SLAs.\n\n- Ensure email security stack is enforcing modern controls: disabling macros by default, attachment sandboxing, file-type spoofing detection, and specific rules for SVG and atypical file types.\n\n- Review and update ATM and payment terminal security baselines with fraud/ATM operations: physical port lockdown, OS hardening, application whitelisting, logging and monitoring coverage.\n\n- Perform an access review for privileged users (including SOC, IR, admins, third parties); tighten least privilege, enforce hardware-backed MFA, and implement stronger session monitoring.\n\n- Refine incident playbooks for:  \n  - Compromised perimeter appliance scenarios (firewall/email/VPN).  \n  - Data-theft-driven extortion (including rapid containment, negotiations support, and comms).\n\n- Schedule a short awareness push for staff on malicious attachments and unusual file types, emphasizing not to open unexpected images/Office docs from external senders and how to report them quickly.",
