  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of React Server Components “React2Shell” (CVE-2025-55182) and an unpatched Gogs zero‑day are delivering a range of malware; internet-exposed app servers and dev tooling are the main concern.\n- Google Chrome has yet another in‑the‑wild zero‑day; urgent browser patching is required to reduce drive‑by and phishing‑led compromise.\n- Multiple new malware families (NANOREMOTE, ValleyRAT, DroidLock, new ransomware variants) show continued abuse of cloud APIs, bring‑your‑own‑driver, and multi‑platform payloads; tighten EDR and cloud monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **React Server Components / React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) – active exploitation**\n  - What happened: Multiple vendors (Sophos, Cloudflare, Imperva, Qualys, CISA) report active RCE campaigns abusing React Server Components (React2Shell) to deliver varied malware.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any internet-facing web app using vulnerable RSC frameworks on our stack or third‑party SaaS could be a foothold for web‑to‑host compromise and data theft.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Coordinate with app/cloud teams to confirm whether we host or rely on React RSC-based services and whether patches/mitigations are applied; prioritize review of WAF and web server logs for anomalous POSTs to RSC endpoints, unexpected reverse shells, or webserver child processes spawning interpreters (node, python, bash, powershell).\n\n- **Unpatched Gogs Git service zero‑day – >700 servers hacked**\n  - What happened: A critical remote exploit against Gogs (self-hosted Git) has been used for months, with >700 known compromised instances and no official patch yet.\n  - Why it matters operationally: If any internal or vendor dev platforms run Gogs (or white‑labeled forks), they may be a high‑value entry point for software supply-chain and credential theft.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Confirm with DevOps that we do NOT run Gogs (directly or via third‑party); if present, move any Gogs instance behind VPN, restrict access, enforce strong auth, and immediately hunt for webshells, anomalous admin/logins, new SSH keys/repos and outbound C2 from those hosts.\n\n- **New Chrome in‑the‑wild zero‑day(s) – update browsers**\n  - What happened: Google and multiple vendors report another high‑severity Chrome zero‑day under active exploitation in the wild; patches are released.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Increases risk from drive‑by attacks via phishing or malicious ads/sites, leading to code execution on endpoints (esp. unmanaged/poorly patched browsers).\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Verify via endpoint management that enterprise Chrome/Chromium-based browsers auto‑update and are at latest version; raise a short advisory to staff to restart browsers today; monitor web proxy and EDR for exploitation artifacts (browser spawning unusual child processes, dropped executables).\n\n- **NANOREMOTE & other Windows malware using cloud APIs and BYOD drivers**\n  - What happened: NANOREMOTE uses Google Drive API for C2 on Windows; ValleyRAT uses a stealthy driver install to bypass Windows 11 protections; multiple malware campaigns are noted in the last 24h.\n  - Why it matters operationally: These techniques can hide C2 in legitimate cloud traffic and evade AV/EDR via vulnerable or stolen signed drivers, enabling long‑term footholds.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Review EDR telemetry for unsigned/suspicious kernel drivers and new drivers installed outside standard tooling (T1068/T1067.001); add hunts for abnormal Google Drive API usage patterns (service accounts, servers contacting Drive, bulk file listing/download), and unusual child processes spawned from drive sync clients or browsers.\n\n- **New phishing / consent-grant & infostealer activity (ClickFix/ConsentFix, macOS & AI‑chat abuse)**\n  - What happened: New “ConsentFix” and evolved ClickFix phishing flows abuse OAuth consent and official ChatGPT website/AI chats to deliver macOS infostealers and steal credentials/crypto.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Bypasses traditional email content filters by leveraging trusted brands, leading to persistent OAuth token abuse and theft of banking credentials from staff or high‑value clients.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Increase monitoring of IdP/OAuth logs for suspicious app consent grants (new apps, broad scopes, non‑corporate publishers) (T1528); tune email and web gateways for lures abusing AI/chat themes and fake ChatGPT/LLM share links; if available, run a quick search for high‑risk OAuth apps in our tenant and revoke/notify as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **React2Shell / RSC exploitation**\n  - Web server/WAF logs: hunt for anomalous POST/GET to RSC endpoints, unusual query parameters or large payloads; correlate with new processes from web server accounts (T1190, T1059).\n  - Application/host logs: flag shells/interpreters (node, python, bash, powershell) launched by web server processes, new outbound connections from app servers to uncommon IPs.\n\n- **Gogs / Git service abuse**\n  - If any Git services present: monitor auth logs for new admins, logins from unusual geos/ASNs, new SSH keys or tokens added; web logs for access to /install, /admin, /explore, and unexpected file uploads (T1552, T1606).\n  - Network logs: watch for Git servers making outbound HTTPS to unknown IPs/C2, which is atypical for internal‑only code hosts.\n\n- **Chrome zero‑day exploitation / drive‑by**\n  - EDR: detect browser processes spawning cmd.exe/powershell/wscript/mshta or writing executables to temp/user profile (T1204, T1203).\n  - Proxy/DNS: watch for spikes in traffic to newly registered domains from many endpoints in short time, especially following phishing campaigns.\n\n- **Cloud API/C2 (NANOREMOTE, LLM‑chat abuse)**\n  - Proxy/Cloud logs: monitor Google Drive, other cloud‑storage and AI/LLM domains for non‑browser user‑agents, unusual API calls (list/download many files, repetitive polling), or use from servers (T1105).\n  - Identity logs: detect anomalous access to AI/chat and cloud storage from privileged accounts or at unusual hours/geos.\n\n- **Malware/ransomware families (Warlock, VolkLocker, 01flip, DroidLock)**\n  - EDR: look for mass file modifications/encryptions, creation of ransom notes, stopping of backup/AV services, and use of lolbins for encryption (T1486, T1489).\n  - Network: SMB/WinRM/Lateral movement scanning from endpoints, and large outbound data transfers prior to encryption.\n\n- **Malicious VS Code extensions / developer tooling**\n  - Endpoint logs: inventory VS Code extensions on dev machines; monitor for VS Code spawning network tools, powershell, or encoding/decoding utilities (T1059, T1105).\n  - Web proxy: pay attention to extension downloads from unusual/non‑Microsoft marketplaces or GitHub repos.\n\n- **Windows driver abuse (ValleyRAT and others)**\n  - EDR/Sysmon: alert on new kernel driver installations, especially unsigned or not in our approved list; correlate with privilege escalation or disabling of security tools (T1068, T1562.001).\n  - Windows event logs: review Code Integrity and device guard logs for blocked/allowed but unusual drivers.\n\n- **ICS/OT advisories (CISA 12 ICS alerts) – for branches/ATM/physical security**\n  - If we run any Johnson Controls/Siemens/PLC gear in datacenters or branches: collect firewall/VPN logs around those networks, monitor remote access into OT segments, and flag direct internet connections from OT devices (T0888 – network boundary bridging).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patch and dependency review for React2Shell & RSC**\n  - Work with dev/application owners to inventory frameworks using React Server Components; ensure patches or recommended mitigations are applied and WAF rules are in place.\n\n- **Third‑party and internal code‑hosting risk review**\n  - Confirm all internal/external Git platforms (Gogs, Gitea, GitLab, GitHub Enterprise, etc.) are patched, access‑restricted, and monitored; update vendor risk questionnaires for any supplier using Gogs‑like systems.\n\n- **Enterprise browser and extension management**\n  - Enforce centralized Chrome/Edge policy for auto‑updates and restrict unapproved extensions; consider blocking developer‑oriented extensions on non‑dev endpoints.\n\n- **Hardening against OAuth/consent‑based phishing**\n  - Tighten IdP policies: require admin approval for high‑risk OAuth apps, restrict scopes, and implement user prompts/awareness about consent screens and AI/ChatGPT‑themed lures.\n\n- **Driver and EDR policy enhancements**\n  - Maintain a denylist of known‑bad or unsigned drivers; enable kernel‑mode driver blocking/attack surface reduction where supported, and test more aggressive EDR policies for BYOD‑style driver installs.\n\n- **Mobile and remote‑work security posture (DroidLock & others)**\n  - Review MDM/EMM controls for Android and iOS used by staff and VIPs; enforce store‑only app installs, device encryption, and remote wipe; refresh user awareness on sideloading and malicious apps.",
