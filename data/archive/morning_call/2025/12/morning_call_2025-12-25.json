  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of an old FortiGate flaw allows bypassing 2FA on firewalls; confirms continued risk from unpatched perimeter devices.\n- New WebRAT malware is being distributed via fake “PoC exploits” on GitHub, posing risk to red-team/engineering hosts and build environments.\n- Ongoing seasonal scam and job-fraud campaigns (including MENA-focused) increase phishing and fraud attempts against customers and staff.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **FortiGate 2FA-bypass vulnerability under active exploitation**  \n  - What happened: Actors are exploiting a three‑year‑old FortiGate firewall vulnerability to bypass 2FA and gain admin access.  \n  - Why it matters: Direct compromise of perimeter firewalls = credential theft, VPN hijack, pivot into internal network (high impact for financials).  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm whether any Fortinet devices exist (incl. third parties/branches); if yes, verify patch level and 2FA configuration today.  \n    - Hunt firewall/VPN logs for: new admin logins from unusual IPs, failed → successful logins without expected 2FA prompts, config changes outside change windows.\n\n- **Malicious “WebRAT” malware posing as GitHub PoC exploits**  \n  - What happened: WebRAT malware is being spread via GitHub repos that pretend to be exploit PoCs; opening/executing them infects the host.  \n  - Why it matters: High risk for our security team, developers and build systems that may download PoCs, potentially leading to initial access and C2.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Flag and review any recent downloads of PoC exploit code from GitHub/unknown repos on corporate devices; focus on security/dev hosts.  \n    - Tighten EDR policy on security and developer workstations: block unsigned scripts/binaries from user temp/downloads; monitor for new RAT-like persistence and outbound C2.\n\n- **Critical MongoDB vulnerability enabling data exposure (zlib-related)**  \n  - What happened: A newly highlighted critical MongoDB issue can expose sensitive data via zlib compression behavior.  \n  - Why it matters: Any internet‑exposed or poorly segmented MongoDB used by apps could leak customer or transaction data without authentication.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Inventory: confirm where MongoDB runs (on-prem, cloud, vendor‑hosted), and whether affected versions/configs are present.  \n    - For exposed or semi-exposed MongoDB, enable heightened logging, verify TLS/auth/ZAP rules, and work with platform teams to apply vendor guidance/patches ASAP.\n\n- **Seasonal scams & MENA-targeted fake job / quick-cash schemes**  \n  - What happened: Multiple reports of coordinated job scam and quick‑cash campaigns in MENA, plus general spike in festive-season consumer scams.  \n  - Why it matters: Increased phishing against customers and possibly staff; potential brand abuse using our name in fake job/loan/quick-cash offers.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Increase monitoring of email and web for brand impersonation (our domain/name in job offers, investment/loan pitches).  \n    - Tune phishing detections for job offer / urgent payment themes; ensure rapid triage of customer-facing fraud and abuse reports.\n\n- **Untrusted VPN/proxy apps intercepting traffic (Urban VPN case)**  \n  - What happened: A popular free VPN/proxy service was found to surreptitiously intercept AI chat content, implying deeper traffic inspection.  \n  - Why it matters: Staff using unapproved VPN/proxy on corporate devices could exfiltrate internal data and bypass our security stack.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Hunt endpoints for presence of known consumer VPN/proxy apps; enforce removal on corporate devices.  \n    - Reiterate via internal comms: only corporate-approved VPNs allowed; remind staff of data-handling policies, especially around AI tools.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Perimeter / VPN / firewall (FortiGate & similar)** – [ATT&CK: T1078, T1098]  \n  - Review last 30 days of admin and VPN logins: unusual geolocation, new IPs, logins outside business hours, multiple failed logins followed by success.  \n  - Alert on config changes (new local admins, SSO/2FA changes, new policies) without associated approved change ticket.\n\n- **Endpoint/EDR – PoC-based malware (WebRAT and similar)** – [ATT&CK: T1204, T1059, T1105]  \n  - Hunt for: recent execution of binaries/scripts from Downloads, Desktop, %TEMP%, or Git-cloned directories that connect to external IPs/domains.  \n  - Monitor for new scheduled tasks, Run/RunOnce keys, or services created shortly after decompression/execution of archives obtained from GitHub.\n\n- **Database and application logs – MongoDB exposure** – [ATT&CK: T1005, T1213]  \n  - Check MongoDB logs for unusual client IPs, spikes in query volume, or unauthenticated connections (if possible).  \n  - Correlate WAF/NGFW logs for HTTP(S) traffic directly targeting MongoDB ports (e.g., 27017) or unusual application endpoints performing bulk reads.\n\n- **Email gateway + proxy – phishing, job scams, seasonal fraud** – [ATT&CK: T1566]  \n  - Enhance rules for: “job offer”, “quick cash”, “work from home”, “urgent bonus/payout”, “account blocked for Christmas sale” themes, especially from free-mail domains.  \n  - Monitor clicks and subsequent downloads from such emails; prioritize triage where attachments or macro-enabled docs are involved.\n\n- **Endpoint / network – suspicious VPN/proxy use** – [ATT&CK: T1090, T1041]  \n  - Use EDR and software inventory to detect installation/execution of consumer VPN/proxy apps; correlate with outbound connections to atypical VPN ASNs.  \n  - Alert on TLS tunnels to uncommon ports or new long‑lived connections from endpoints not expected to run VPN clients.\n\n- **Cloud / Dev / engineering hosts – GitHub and tooling** – [ATT&CK: T1190, T1195]  \n  - Log and review outbound connections to GitHub from build servers and jump boxes; validate any new tools or PoC repos pulled in the last 7 days.  \n  - Monitor for curl/wget/git followed shortly by execution of downloaded file with elevated privileges (sudo, run as service).\n\n- **UEFI / boot-level research (DMA/IOMMU bypass)** – [ATT&CK: T1542]  \n  - Not an immediate mass threat, but stay alert for anomalies indicating boot‑level tampering: secure boot disabled, unexpected firmware changes, or EDR “sensor missing” events following reboots.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Perimeter hardening & patch hygiene**  \n  - Confirm all network edge devices (VPNs, firewalls, load balancers) are inventoried and on a strict patch SLA; classify any Fortinet presence as priority.  \n  - Implement periodic external attack-surface scans specifically looking for outdated appliance versions and default management ports exposed.\n\n- **Safe research / PoC handling policy**  \n  - Formalize guidelines for downloading/testing exploit PoCs (isolated lab networks, non-production VMs, code review before execution).  \n  - Provide a hardened “research enclave” for security engineers with strict egress controls and enhanced monitoring.\n\n- **Database security posture (MongoDB and others)**  \n  - Review all non-relational/NoSQL deployments (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc.) for proper auth, TLS, and network segmentation; remove any direct internet exposure.  \n  - Work with DB/platform teams to ensure security logging is standardized and centrally ingested.\n\n- **User awareness – scams & job fraud**  \n  - Run a short seasonal awareness push for employees focusing on job offers, investment/loan scams, and impersonation of our brand.  \n  - Coordinate with fraud and customer-services teams to share IOCs and typologies of current scams targeting customers.\n\n- **Endpoint & application allowlists**  \n  - Expand application control/whitelisting on critical admin and finance endpoints to block unapproved VPN/proxy, remote-access tools, and developer utilities.  \n  - Periodically review allowed browser extensions and client utilities that can proxy traffic or capture credentials.\n\n- **Third-party & vendor risk**  \n  - Ask key vendors (especially those managing firewalls, VPNs, or databases on our behalf) to confirm their patching status re: Fortinet and MongoDB issues.  \n  - Ensure contracts/SLA include timely notification and remediation of critical security advisories.",
