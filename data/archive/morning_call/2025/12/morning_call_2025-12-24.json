  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Critical RCEs in internet-facing infrastructure (WatchGuard Firebox/Fireware, n8n, Digiever, HPE OneView) are actively exploited with PoCs released; prioritize exposure checks and emergency patching/mitigations.\n- Ransomware and credential theft activity continues to lean on weak remote access (open RDP/SMB), fake tools (fake PoCs, npm package, Chrome “VPN” extensions), and social engineering (false human verification, tax-themed lures).\n- Multiple data-theft and browser/extension threats highlight ongoing risk to customer and employee credentials; tighten browser, npm, and extension controls and monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **WatchGuard Firebox / Fireware OS critical RCE (CVE-2025-14733) – actively exploited**\n  - What happened: Critical RCE in WatchGuard Firebox/Fireware used in real-world attacks; ~120K IPs reportedly exposed.\n  - Why it matters: Internet-facing firewalls are a common initial access vector for ransomware and persistent access into internal networks.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Inventory any WatchGuard Firebox/Fireware; confirm firmware against latest advisory; apply patches or vendor mitigations ASAP.  \n    - If exposed and unpatched, assume possible compromise: pull logs, look for abnormal admin logins/config changes, and consider password/PKI rotation.\n\n- **n8n automation platform RCE (CVSS ~10, PoC public, >100K instances exposed)**\n  - What happened: Critical expression engine isolation failure in n8n enables arbitrary code execution; multiple detailed writeups and PoC exploits out.\n  - Why it matters: n8n often holds API keys, secrets and has connectivity to core systems; compromise can pivot deep into internal/business workflows.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Identify any self-hosted n8n (on-prem or cloud); if internet-exposed, treat as priority-1 for patching or temporary access restriction (VPN-only, WAF).  \n    - Review recent n8n logs and hosting system logs for new/abnormal users, unexpected workflows, and shell/child-process creation.\n\n- **Actively exploited Digiever DS-2105 Pro authorization vulnerability (on CISA KEV)**\n  - What happened: CISA added a Digiever DS-2105 Pro authorization flaw to KEV following active exploitation.\n  - Why it matters: Even if we don’t use this exact device, it signals ongoing targeting of edge cameras/NVR/IoT for footholds and lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm whether any Digiever or similar NVR/camera systems exist in branches or data centers; if yes, restrict internet access and schedule patching.  \n    - For any internet-facing IoT/camera/NVR, review for strange outbound connections and admin logins from non-standard IPs.\n\n- **Ransomware trends: HardBit 4.0 + React2Shell / Qilin & water-utility attack**\n  - What happened: HardBit 4.0 abuses open RDP/SMB; React2Shell ransomware case tied to vulnerable web server; Qilin spreads via fake “human verification”; Romanian water authority hit by ransomware, taking ~1000 systems offline.\n  - Why it matters: Confirms attackers are still very effective with basic misconfigurations (RDP/SMB) and web app/RDP exposure; potential analog for our branches and OT-adjacent assets.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Validate no external RDP/SMB is open to the internet; if exceptions exist, verify MFA and log collection; review for brute-force patterns in last 7 days.  \n    - Re-check patch status and WAF coverage for public web apps (especially Node/React/Next.js stacks); hunt for webshell/CLI spawn from webserver processes.\n\n- **Credential theft via browser extensions and npm package (Chrome VPN extensions & fake WhatsApp API package)**\n  - What happened: Malicious Chrome “VPN” extensions and an npm package with 56K downloads were found stealing WhatsApp credentials/data and intercepting user traffic.\n  - Why it matters: High risk of credential exfiltration from developers, customer-support teams, and staff using unmanaged extensions or npm modules.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm browser-extension allowlists on corporate-managed browsers; block VPN/proxy extensions by default; alert on deviations.  \n    - For build/dev environments, enforce npm repository controls (private registry/allowlist); check for use of suspicious WhatsApp API-style packages and rotate affected credentials if found.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Firewall / VPN / network edge (WatchGuard, Digiever, similar) – Initial Access (T1190, T1133)**\n  - Monitor firewall logs for: new/unknown admin accounts, config changes outside maintenance windows, and logins from unusual geos/IP ranges.\n  - On any edge device, look for spikes in HTTP/HTTPS error codes, repeated requests to admin URLs, or access from scanning IPs.\n\n- **Automation/orchestration platforms (n8n, similar tools) – Command Execution (T1059), Lateral Movement (T1021)**\n  - Collect application logs and host EDR; hunt for shell/PowerShell/python processes spawned by n8n or node.js service accounts.\n  - Search for new/modified workflows that execute OS commands, connect to unfamiliar domains, or access new internal systems.\n\n- **RDP/SMB exposure and brute forcing – Valid Accounts (T1078), Brute Force (T1110)**\n  - From Windows event logs and network IDS: alert on multiple failed RDP logons followed by success, especially from external IPs or TOR/VPN ranges.\n  - Track SMB access to critical file shares from unusual hosts or service accounts; detect mass file rename/encryption patterns.\n\n- **Web applications (Next.js/React/Operation PCPcat, React2Shell) – Web Exploitation (T1190)**\n  - Web/WAF logs: monitor for anomalous POSTs to rarely used endpoints, long query strings, or payloads containing OS command characters (`;`, `&&`, `|`, `$( )`).\n  - EDR on web servers: flag new binaries, webshell-like files, or processes running under webserver accounts connecting outbound to rare IPs.\n\n- **Browser & extension misuse – Credential Access (T1555), Exfiltration to Cloud (T1567)**\n  - From endpoint and proxy logs: detect installation of new browser extensions, especially VPN/proxy, crypto, or messaging-related; correlate with connections to unknown extension CDNs.\n  - Look for browser processes making unusual connections to non-standard ports or high-risk countries, and POSTing large volumes of form data.\n\n- **npm / development environments – Supply Chain Compromise (T1195.002)**\n  - On dev endpoints/CI: log npm installs; alert on new packages with low reputation, typosquats, or direct GitHub/raw URLs.\n  - EDR: watch for node/npm processes accessing browser credential stores, keychains, or reading SMS/contacts-type data (where applicable).\n\n- **Phishing / social engineering (income-tax-themed lures, fake human verification, browser-based e-challan scams) – Phishing (T1566)**\n  - Email and proxy: detect tax-/payment-/fine-themed messages with links to non-official domains; use URL sandboxing.\n  - Web logs: watch for repeated visits to short-link or CAPTCHA/verification sites preceding malware downloads.\n\n- **Data theft & stealer malware (MacSync, WhatsApp data theft) – Collection (T1114, T1552)**\n  - EDR: alert on processes accessing browser storage, password managers, or messaging app data directories, especially from non-standard binaries.\n  - Monitor outbound TLS connections to newly seen domains shortly after such access.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Asset & exposure review for edge devices and automation tools**\n  - Complete inventory of internet-facing firewalls, NVR/cameras, automation/orchestration platforms (n8n, similar); enforce central logging and MFA where supported.\n\n- **Hardening RDP/SMB and remote access**\n  - Implement default-deny for external RDP/SMB; enforce just-in-time access, network-level authentication, and mandatory MFA for all remaining remote admin pathways.\n\n- **Browser and extension governance**\n  - Formalize extension allowlist for corporate browsers; block VPN/proxy, crypto wallets, and messaging extensions by policy; review MDM/Intune profiles.\n\n- **Secure developer and CI/CD practices**\n  - Introduce/strengthen internal npm registry with strict allowlists; integrate SCA (software composition analysis) and reputation checks into pipelines.\n\n- **Awareness training refresh**\n  - Short, targeted awareness push on: fake human verification, tax/payment-themed phishing, and risks of installing “free” VPNs or PoC tools from untrusted sources.\n\n- **Incident playbooks & threat hunting**\n  - Update ransomware and edge-device compromise playbooks with WatchGuard/n8n/Digiever-specific checks; schedule a focused hunt across last 30 days for related TTPs (edge exploitation → lateral movement → encryption).",
