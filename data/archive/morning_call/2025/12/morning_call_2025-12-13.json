  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑55182) and related React/Next.js RSC flaws is escalating globally; any internet-facing RSC / Next.js services must be assumed at risk.\n- Multiple Windows zero‑days and high‑impact vulns (Cloud Files Minifilter, Remote Access Connection Manager, Rasman 0‑day) plus actively exploited third‑party services (GeoServer, Gladinet CentreStack) raise risk of initial access and privilege escalation in Windows-heavy environments.\n- New stealthy malware and phishing tooling (NANOREMOTE using Google Drive C2, BlackForce and other AI‑driven MFA‑bypass phishing kits, fake collaboration app installers) increase likelihood of credential theft and covert remote access.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑55182) & React/Next.js RSC exploitation**\n  - What happened: Multiple sources report large‑scale, in‑the‑wild exploitation of React2Shell and follow‑up RSC vulnerabilities in React/Next.js, with toolkits publicly available.\n  - Why it matters: Any of our public web apps, portals, or APIs built on React Server Components / Next.js server actions could be used for RCE, source disclosure, or lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with app/platform teams whether we run any RSC‑enabled React/Next.js internet‑facing services; if yes, verify emergency patching/mitigations are in progress.  \n    - Increase scrutiny of WAF / reverse proxy logs for those hosts (suspicious POSTs to /_next, server action endpoints, unusual 5xx/4xx spikes); enable temporary tighter WAF rules and block known exploit patterns where vendors provide signatures.\n\n- **Actively exploited OSGeo GeoServer vulnerability (added to CISA KEV)**\n  - What happened: CISA and multiple outlets report an OSGeo GeoServer flaw is being actively exploited and is now in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n  - Why it matters: If we or key third parties use GeoServer for mapping/GIS (common in risk, branch, and asset‑location systems), compromise could provide direct access to internal data and pivot points.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify any GeoServer instances in our environment or exposed via vendors/partners; confirm patch or compensating controls with owners.  \n    - Hunt in web/proxy logs for unusual access patterns to GeoServer paths (/geoserver, WMS/WFS endpoints) and any subsequent internal lateral movement from those servers.\n\n- **Gladinet CentreStack / file‑sharing RCE actively exploited**\n  - What happened: Multiple reports show attackers exploiting a cryptographic flaw in Gladinet CentreStack file‑sharing servers for RCE.\n  - Why it matters: If used for file transfer with customers/partners, compromise can lead to data theft and staging of ransomware or backdoors.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm whether any CentreStack/Gladinet products are in use or hosted by vendors; if yes, check patch status or isolate from the internet until remediated.  \n    - Hunt for anomalous logins, new admin accounts, and unexpected outbound connections from these servers; monitor for suspicious file uploads (.aspx, .php, binaries, encoded scripts).\n\n- **Windows zero‑day / high‑risk components (Cloud Files Minifilter, Remote Access Connection Manager, Rasman)**\n  - What happened: CISA warns of active exploitation of a Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter 0‑day; separate advisories highlight privilege‑escalation/DoS bugs in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager and a Rasman 0‑day with unofficial patches.\n  - Why it matters: These components are present on many Windows clients/servers; exploitation can support local privilege escalation, persistence, or targeted disruption, especially on RDS/VPN gateways and terminal servers.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Prioritize monitoring of high‑value Windows servers (DCs, RDS, file servers, VPN gateways) for abnormal service behavior: crashes/restarts of Rasman/rasman.exe, Cloud Files driver errors, and unexpected privilege changes.  \n    - Coordinate with Windows platform team to validate current patch level vs latest advisories; flag any non‑patched high‑value assets for increased EDR alerting and blocking of unsigned or suspicious driver/service loads.\n\n- **Stealth malware & phishing (NANOREMOTE, fake Teams/Meet installers, advanced phishing kits with MFA bypass)**\n  - What happened: New NANOREMOTE malware uses Google Drive API as C2; fake Microsoft Teams/Google Meet installers drop a backdoor; new phishing kits (e.g. BlackForce) use AI and MitB techniques to bypass MFA and steal credentials at scale.\n  - Why it matters: These blend into legitimate SaaS (Google Drive, collaboration tools) and can bypass MFA, increasing risk of account takeover and covert remote access in our user base.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Intensify monitoring for unusual OAuth/API usage to Google Drive/Workspace and abnormal login patterns (impossible travel, new device fingerprints, unusual app consent grants); enforce conditional access where available.  \n    - Tune email/web filters and user‑facing warnings for fake Teams/Meet installers and credential‑harvesting pages; run a quick hunt for recent execution of installers from temp/Downloads launching network connections to unfamiliar domains.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Web apps using React/Next.js (React2Shell & RSC flaws)**  \n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs, container logs, reverse proxies.  \n  - Hunt for: Unusual POSTs/GRAPHQL calls to RSC/server action endpoints, spikes in 500 errors, long user‑agent payloads or encoded data; new processes spawned by web workers (T1190, T1059).\n\n- **GeoServer / CentreStack / similar middleware**  \n  - Log sources: Application logs, web server access logs, host EDR, firewalls.  \n  - Hunt for: Requests with unexpected parameters or encoded payloads to admin/API routes, new files in webroot, suspicious child processes from service accounts (T1190, T1105).\n\n- **Windows privilege‑escalation / driver exploitation**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Security/System logs, Sysmon if available.  \n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Service or driver installs/changes (Event IDs 7045, 6005/6006 anomalies).  \n    - Unexpected token manipulations or privilege escalations by non‑admin processes (T1068).\n\n- **NANOREMOTE & Google Drive C2**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, web proxy/DNS, Google Workspace/Drive audit logs.  \n  - Hunt for: Repeated Drive API calls from non‑browser processes, unusual OAuth tokens or service accounts, clients making high‑frequency small HTTPS requests to drive.google.com outside normal office tools (T1071.001, T1105).\n\n- **Fake collaboration app installers / GitHub malware repos / Docker images with creds**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, web proxy, software inventory, container registry logs.  \n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Executables launched from Downloads or user profiles shortly after visiting GitHub or third‑party download sites.  \n    - Containers pulled from public Docker Hub with embedded credentials; check for secrets in env vars and Docker configs (T1552).\n\n- **Advanced phishing & MFA‑bypass kits (BlackForce, AI‑driven kits)**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, IdP/SAML/OIDC logs, VPN, proxy.  \n  - Hunt for: High‑velocity login attempts using valid usernames from unusual IPs; session hijacking patterns (MFA success followed immediately by login from a different IP/device); abnormal consent to new “productivity” apps (T1566.002, T1111).\n\n- **Ransomware precursors (VolkLocker, general intrusion)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, AD logs, backup/orchestration systems.  \n  - Hunt for: New scheduled tasks or services under suspicious names, mass file access/encryption patterns, deletion/modification of backups or shadow copies (T1053, T1486, T1490).\n\n- **Chrome & browser exploitation / AI agent defenses**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, browser extension/integrity logs where available, proxy.  \n  - Hunt for: Browser crashes followed by process injections or new child processes; users installing unknown extensions; unusual outbound traffic immediately after visiting untrusted sites (T1189, T1203).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive review of React/Next.js and similar frameworks in our stack**  \n  - Work with dev teams to inventory all apps using React Server Components, Next.js server actions, and related frameworks; ensure patching cadence and WAF virtual patches are defined.\n\n- **Apply and validate patches for GeoServer, CentreStack, Apache Struts, Chrome, and Apache Tika**  \n  - Align with infra and app owners to patch or mitigate these components; consider temporary network segmentation or access restrictions for instances that cannot be patched immediately.\n\n- **Harden Windows endpoint/server baselines against current 0‑days**  \n  - Confirm attack surface reduction rules/EDR blocking modes are enabled on high‑value assets; ensure logging for driver/service installs and privilege escalation is robust and centrally collected.\n\n- **Strengthen phishing/MFA‑bypass defenses and user awareness**  \n  - Update phishing simulations and training to include AI‑generated lures, fake collaboration app downloads, and real‑time MFA relay; reinforce policies about downloading software only from trusted corporate stores.\n\n- **Review third‑party/partner exposure (file sharing, GIS, open‑source components)**  \n  - Ensure vendors using file‑sharing, GeoServer, or open‑source packages have patch/IR obligations in contracts; request current security posture for those components where relevant to our data.\n\n- **Secrets and image hygiene in CI/CD and containers**  \n  - Implement or tighten scanning of Docker images and code repositories for embedded credentials; enforce policies to avoid pushing production secrets to public registries or GitHub.",
