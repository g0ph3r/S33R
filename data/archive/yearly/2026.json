    "title": "Flock and Urban Surveillance",
    "summary": "Some years ago, I had a frustrating and largely fruitless encounter with the politics of policing. As a member of an oversight commission, I was particularly interested in the regulation of urban surveillance. The Albuquerque Police Department, for reasons good and bad, has often been an early adopter of surveillance technology. APD deployed automated license plate readers, mounted on patrol cars and portable trailers, in 2013. Initially, the department kept a six-month history of license plate data. For six months, police could retrospectively search the database to reconstruct a vehicle, or person's, movements—at least, those movements that happened near select patrol cars and \"your speed is\" trailers. Lobbying by the American Civil Liberties Union and public pressure on APD and city council lead to a policy change to retain data for only 14 days, a privacy-preserving measure that the ACLU lauded as one of the best ALPR policies in the nation. Today, ALPR is far more common in Albuquerque. Lowering costs and a continuing appetite for solving social problems with surveillance technology means that some parts of the city have ALPR installed at every signalized intersection—every person's movements cataloged at a resolution of four blocks. The data is retained for a full year. Some of it is offered, as a service, to law enforcement agencies across the country. One of the most frustrating parts of the mass surveillance debate is the ability of law enforcement agencies and municipal governments to advance wide-scale monitoring programs, weather the controversy, and then ratchet up retention and sharing after public attention fades. For years, expansive ALPR programs spread through most American cities with little objection. In my part of the country, it seemed that the controversy over ALPR had been completely forgotten until one particularly significant ALPR vendor—Flock Safety—started repeatedly stepping in long-festering controversies with such wild abandon that they are clearly either idiots or entirely unconcerned about public perception. I try not to be too cynical but I am, unfortunately, more inclined to the latter. Companies like Flock know that they are in treacherous territory, morally and legally. They know that their customers are mostly governments or organizations with elected leaders that are subject to popular opinion. They know that helping Texas law enforcement track down abortion seekers in other states is a \"bad look.\" They know all of these things, but they do not particularly care. They don't have to care: decades of incipient corruption, legal and political maneuvering, and the routine inefficacy of municipal politics has created an environment where public opinion doesn't matter. I can't definitely tell you where public opinion lies on ALPR, although it seems like the average person might be mildly in support. From at least my experience, in my corner of the world, I will tell you this: it doesn't matter. Police departments and the means by which they purchase and field technology are so isolated from the political process that it is extremely difficult to imagine a scenario where voters could affect change. Year by year, city by city, the police become more dug in. Law enforcement agencies across the country have found that the most straightforward way to address privacy concerns around surveillance technology is to keep the department's purchase and deployment of that technology a secret. Most city governments at least passively support this approach. The vendors of surveillance systems facilitate, support, and even demand secrecy through their contract terms. More recently, Las Vegas and the Bay Area have offered a model even more opaque to public scrutiny: law enforcement surveillance technology is simply purchased by wealthy private donors, almost invariably from the software industry, and then either the systems or their use are donated to the city. If carefully designed, these programs can be completely exempt from public information rules. They can take the form, for example, of a business association that runs its own private surveillance state, involving the public and ostensibly accountable police only when an arrest is made. We are privatizing mass surveillance. Flock continues to generate enormous press, mostly on the back of persistent investigation by 404 Media. More recently, security researchers have published significant defects in the design of Flock's technology that can make the original video publicly accessible. Just about every time that someone looks into Flock, the company turns out to be less ethical, the users less concerned about compliance, the design of the system itself less competent than charitable viewers had assumed. I'm trying not to be a doomer for Christmas, but I am sometimes frustrated with Flock coverage because it can miss the entire history of this issue. I think that a more contextually complete discussion of urban surveillance could be useful. And I am sitting in a coffee shop, in a trendy part of town, looking out the window at a PTZ camera on the side of a traffic light. That camera, I know, is owned and operated by APD's Real Time Crime Center (RTCC). Between the police department itself, city agencies that participate in the RTCC, and businesses that volunteer real-time access to their surveillance, there are thousands of others like it. Courtesy of a transit station, there are at least a dozen within my view. Whether or not this is a good or bad idea, whether or not it is effective in reducing crime, whether or not it will be leveraged against political opposition; these are tricky questions. I suppose what worries me is that it feels like hardly anyone is asking them any more. It took Flock's remarkable ability to step on rakes and the apparent victory of fascism in national politics for anyone to remember that the construction of ubiquitous surveillance is a project that started many years ago, and that has proceeded largely unhindered ever since. Domestic Signals Intelligence Within the tech community, there has historically been much attention to the ability to track people by passively observing Bluetooth traffic. This technique has been widely used, both in commercial and government applications. There are popular \"smart city\" street lighting systems, for example, that allow every street light to passively collect signatures of the people passing underneath it. To my knowledge, these techniques are not actually very widely used by law enforcement. There are, perhaps, two reasons: one of mechanisms of government, the other of countermeasures. First, \"smart city\" data collection systems are usually funded and deployed by municipal works or environmental departments. While police could make arrangements for access to that data, those arrangements would require the kind of inter-agency Memoranda of Understanding that tend to lead to far more public scrutiny than police acquisitions of surveillance products. Besides, since they aren't deployed for law enforcement purposes, they're often not useful sources for the areas that law enforcement find most interesting: higher-crime areas that are usually lower-income and, thus, less likely to have working street lights at all—much less \"smart\" ones. Besides, smartphones have widely adopted randomization of Bluetooth and WiFi identifiers, and protocol revisions have reduced the number of identifiers transmitted in plaintext. Passive signals intelligence just doesn't work as well as it used to, at least at the capability level of a municipality. Talking about Bluetooth and WiFi on phones does raise the question of the \"phone\" part, the cellular interface, which is targeted by the family of devices often known as \"Stingrays\" after the trademark of a particular manufacturer. Fortunately, improvements in the security design of cellular protocols is making these less effective over time. Unfortunately, the technology continues to advance, sometimes undoing the improvements of newer GSM revisions. Federal and local law enforcement continue to purchase and use these devices, largely in secret, benefiting from a particular model of federal ownership/local use that makes it especially difficult to get a police department to even confirm or deny that they have ever deployed them. \"Stingrays\" or IMSI surveillance is mostly a shadow world of rumors and carefully worded non-denials. Despite technical measures against them, they are clearly still in use, and thus clearly still useful. Optics Out in the rest of the world, visual surveillance is more salient than radio. Early rollouts of police-operated surveillance, dating back to at least the 1970s, generated some controversy over privacy implications. Two things have since happened: first, law enforcement have relied on an increasing number of public-private partnerships and commercial vendors to gain access to surveillance without directly owning it. Second, police video surveillance has largely been normalized, and no longer faces much opposition or even public notice. One of the interesting changes here is one of visibility: police video surveillance has often edged in and out of public awareness to fit the politics. In periods of pro-privacy, anti-surveillance sentiment, departments rely more on voluntary arrangements for access to cameras installed by others. In periods of pro-police, anti-crime sentiment, departments install cameras with flashing lights and police badges. Both types tend to persist after the next change in the tide. The public usually knows little about these systems, a result of intentional opacity by police departments and a general lack of interest by the press. That leads to a lot of confusion. Where I live, we do have an extensive network of police-operated cameras on intersection traffic signal arms. And yet, if you ask the average person to identify a police surveillance camera, they will point to the camera for the traffic signal's video-based lane occupancy sensing every single time. That's not a a police camera, it's barely even a camera as the video is rarely retained. All of these people, it seems, have worked themselves into a sort paranoia where they think that every camera is an eye of the police. Well, the police are watching them, from about ten feet over. The \"speed dome\" PTZ cameras get so much less attention, perhaps because they are usually mounted on the pole further from sightline, or perhaps because they are of a type more common for commercial surveillance systems that we have learned to simply ignore. Video surveillance is an interesting topic to me, philosophically. I am largely unconcerned with the privacy implications of most video surveillance installations (such as the one on my own house) because, historically, the video was recorded locally and generally reviewed only when there was a specific reason. The simple fact that reviewing large amounts of video is so time consuming meant that the pervasive surveillance potential of video surveillance was, at one time not so long ago, quite limited. Of course, the age of the computer has somewhat changed that situation. There are two phenomenon of the automation of surveillance that I think should be considered separately: first, machine vision has improved to an extent that computers can automatically process surveillance video to extract events and identities. Second, the appified, everything-social-media attitude of consumer products creates new dynamics in access to surveillance data, and those dynamics are spreading upwards into the commercial segment. Machine Vision Historically, much of the attention to video pervasive surveillance has centered around facial recognition. Facial recognition has indeed been applied to video surveillance for years, but I think that the average person vastly overestimates how effective and widely used facial recognition is. The vast majority of currently installed surveillance cameras do not produce video of sufficient quality for facial recognition. That has less to do with the quality of the video itself (although that is poorer than you think for most real systems) and more to do with the way that surveillance cameras are used and installed. Most cameras are positioned high up with wide coverage of a room; this perspective is ideal for reconstructing a series of events but just about the worst case for facial recognition. For most surveillance cameras, human faces are small and at indirect angles. There is little geometry that you can extract from a face that is about ten pixels wide and subjected to aggressive h264 compression, which is how most surveillance video comes out. Practical facial recognition systems involve cameras installed specifically for that purpose, roughly at eye level where they will get close-up, straight-on images of people who pass by. Next time you visit a bank branch, look by the exit doors for a conspicuously thick height strip. Height strips by exit doors were invented to allow clerks to give police a more accurate description of a robber, but they have since evolved to serve largely as subterfuge. Somewhere around 5' 6\", you will notice a small hole, and behind that hole is a camera. Several manufacturers offer these and they seem very popular in financial services. Kroger is more to the point: they've just been installing dome cameras right at eye height on their exit doors, for at least a decade. When discussing surveillance, it's important to remember that the vast majority of real-world video surveillance systems are old, inexpensive, and poorly maintained. Even where cameras are installed specifically for a good view of faces, there probably isn't any facial recognition in use, most of the time. Facial recognition products are expensive and don't currently manifest many benefits unless the organization is large enough to have a security department to work with the resulting data, which requires a degree of operational maturity beyond most surveillance users (e.g. gas stations). All of that said, there are plenty of real-world facial recognition deployments. Rite Aid, for example, prominently rolled out facial recognition to flag known shoplifters at their stores... a rollout that went so poorly that it lead to a lawsuit and an FTC settlement including the end of the facial recognition program and a five-year moratorium on further attempts. This is not to say that facial recognition on video surveillance isn't legal (although in some states it isn't or at least requires a lot of disclosure), but there is definitely a degree of legal and reputational hazard involved. The ACLU has periodically conducted call-around surveys on use of facial recognition. The most notable trend is that most large chains now refuse to talk about it. I could be wrong, but my experience with corporate communications behavior leads to me to interpret a refusal to comment along these lines: Home Depot, for example, is a very large company that will have various initiatives underway, and either confirming or denying their use of facial recognition would probably be wrong in some cases and expose them to compliance or legal risk in others. I would bet good money that Home Depot has some facial recognition technology deployed at some locations, but knowing how slowly security technology tends to roll out in that kind of company and how complicated the legal and compliance situation can become, it's probably limited. They are probably acutely aware of the controversy surrounding this type of surveillance and, given the example of Rite Aid, the ways a rollout could go wrong. That means that surveillance will spread slowly. But it will spread. At this point, I think it is inevitable that facial recognition will become widely used in video surveillance. I just think the point at which \"facial recognition is everywhere\" remains some years away, due to all the normal reasons: technical limitations, slow-moving bureaucracies, and a somewhat complex and unclear regulatory situation. It will inevitably happen, for the same reasons as well: aggressive sales by facial recognition vendors. There are some sectors where facial recognition is very common, although I don't get the impression that retail is one of these yet. Casinos, for example—some of the larger Las Vegas casinos have reportedly had facial recognition systems in use for decades, and Nevada law is very permissive of them. Casinos are, of course, pretty much ideal users. Large institutions with a lot of financial risk and large, sophisticated security departments. Few other businesses outside of Target can compete with the size and sophistication of casino security departments. There's a whole lot of money flying around, and they can spend some of it on expensive per-camera licensing without much leadership objection. License Plate Reading Popular attention to facial recognition has mostly fallen away as industry and media focus has shifted to another application of machine vision that is, it turns out, a whole lot easier: license plates. License plates are designed for readability, and most states use retroreflective paints that give you an absolutely beautiful high-contrast image under coaxial (i.e. mounted alongside the camera) infrared illumination. There's not much that is easier to read by machine vision. Automated license plate readers have been available for quite a long time: US CBP had an experimental ALPR installation at a Texas border crossing in 1994. That system was actually deemed a failure and removed, but technology improved and there were permanent installations at larger border crossings by the end of the 1990s. For a long time, the dominant vendor of ALPR equipment in the US was Motorola. Motorola's product line remains popular for vehicle-mounted systems, but the high price of the cameras, controllers, and software package had a side benefit of limiting the pervasiveness of ALPR. The equipment was just too expensive to put up all over the place. In Albuquerque, for example, the ALPR program long consisted of Motorola systems mounted on portable \"your speed is\" trailers. The portable nature of these setups made the expense more worthwhile, and besides, portability has its own utilities: an APD detective once told me, for example, of how they would leave ALPR trailers in front of the houses of people suspected to lead criminal gangs. While there was value in the intelligence collection, the main motivation was intimidation: while you might call the \"your speed is\" trailers a concealed system, they're not all that subtle, and one supposes that most vehicle-based criminals (the main kind here) are aware that they function as the eyes of the police. At some point, in response to growing budgets or lowered costs I'm not sure, APD began installing fixed Motorola ALPR systems on the light arms of major intersections. I know of around a dozen installations of this type in Albuquerque, which is the beginning of a widespread capability to monitor public movements but not exactly the dystopian pervasive surveillance of Minority Report. ALPR works pretty well, but it is not perfect. Cameras need to be installed with fairly narrow optics aimed at the right spot, and infrared illumination makes reading far more reliable. Speaking of Las Vegas, I used to use a certain casino parking garage with an ALPR-based payment system with some regularity. It printed the license plate, as read by the ALPR, on the parking ticket, which is why I know that it was almost comically inept at reading my very legible California plate. It always got about half the characters wrong. I have gotten much better results in my own home experiments with budget equipment, so I figure that system must have been very poorly installed or maintained, but I'm sure there are plenty of others out there just like it. That's the tricky thing about video surveillance, from the \"blue team\" side of the house: people don't tend to pay a lot of attention to it until there's been an incident, at which point they find out that the lens has had mud on it for the last three months (a much bigger problem with ALPR cameras that used to be mounted pretty low to the ground for a better look angle). I bring this up because I think that people tend to vastly overestimate the quality of real-world video surveillance, and I like to take every opportunity to remind people that the main failure case of retail video surveillance used to be failure to replace the continuous-loop tape cassette before it was completely demagnetized by repeated recording. Now, in 2025, the continuous-loop tape cassettes are pretty much gone, but maintenance practices haven't improved. Lots of the cameras you see in public only barely work or don't work at all. So it goes. Flock In 2017, though, a VC-backed (and specifically YCombinator) company called Flock Safety introduced a bold new idea to ALPR: a Silicon Valley sales model. Flock's system is built to be low-cost, and the sensors are smaller, simpler, and cheaper than Motorola's. I suppose they might be less effective as a result, but a reduced \"catch\" rate doesn't really detract from mass-surveillance ALPR installations that much. Flock has also greatly expanded their customer base, emphasizing sales to private organizations as well as law enforcement and government. Speaking of Home Depot, for example, Home Depot seems to have installed their own Flock cameras in all of their parking lots. Lowes Home Improvement has done the same. I wanted to know more definitely how much Flock systems cost, because I suspected they were making significant inroads just through low pricing. It's a little tricky to say definitively because Flock is a \"call for quote\" kind of company and I think they offer contracts on different price bases. Scouring contracting documents, meeting notes, etc., it seems like a \"typical\" cost for a Flock camera is around $4,000 with about $3,000 a year in per-camera software licensing fees. That might seem expensive but it compares well to the five-figure prices I have heard associated with Motorola systems, especially since the Flock offering is more \"white glove\" with installation and maintenance packaged. Motorola systems are usually purchased through an integrator who adds their own considerable margin. Flock also designs their cameras to be amenable to solar power, which radically reduces install costs compared to Motorola systems that usually need a utility worker out to splice power from a streetlight. More even than a price reduction, it makes Flock cameras much more available to organizations like HOAs that control territory in a sense but do not have the full bucket truck or utility work order capabilities of a municipal government. Another recent innovation in ALPR is less traceable to Flock but certainly seems associated with them: flexible funding sources. Police departments have limited budgets with which to acquire new technology, and technology vendors have to compete with other budget priorities like salaries, vehicles, and black-on-black tactical vinyl jobs for those vehicles. ALPR seems especially attractive for public-private partnership mechanisms, so there are a lot of Flock installations that were funded by business associations, HOAs, neighborhood associations, and other \"indirect\" sources. Some of these systems are owned and operated by the police with only the funding donated, others are owned and operated by the private group that paid for them. This can result in curious deployment decisions: sometimes the lowest-crime neighborhoods are the most replete with ALPR, as they tend to be wealthier and more politically organized communities with the wherewithall to put up the money. The most important thing to understand about Flock, though, is that it has built on Amazon's concept of \"Ring neighbors\" to build a sort of nationwide, ALPR-centric Nextdoor. Flock customers can basically check a box that allows other Flock customers to access data from their sensors, and of course Flock strongly encourages users to turn sharing on. While there are some audit and access controls available on Flock data sharing, they seem like pretty minimal efforts that are often ignored. Flock sharing has generated a lot of press, especially with some dramatic examples like use by a Texas sheriff to locate an abortion patient and use by ICE/CBP to track suspects. These are both examples that raise one of the most alarming aspects of the Flock situation: many states and municipalities have laws in place that limit or at least monitor collaboration of local police with other police agencies and federal law enforcement. Some people find this surprising, but it's important to understand that the United States is a republic of nominally independent governments. Laws, policies, and priorities can vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There is a specific historical thread, related to the tracing of escaped slaves, that has made resource sharing between different law enforcement agencies a known area of moral and legal treachery for a very long time. And yet, it turns out, most Flock customers seem to have sharing turned on, possibly entirely without their knowledge. There are now multiple well-established cases of local law enforcement agencies violating state laws by having data sharing with ICE/CBP enabled. It is possible for Flock users to turn off or restrict sharing, but I think a lot of them honestly don't know that. Some state Attorneys General have ordered Flock users to disable sharing, some have restricted or banned Flock products entirely, but in general it's a very messy situation. It appears that a lack of care by law enforcement and other Flock customers, facilitate and no doubt encouraged by Flock's motivation towards \"network effect\" lock-in, has resulted in widespread and brazen violation of privacy laws that is only now making its way to the courts. In other words, the tech industry happened. Acoustics I will not spend much time here discussing wide-area acoustic surveillance like ShotSpotter, in part because I have written a bit about it before . It's a complex issue: a well-designed gunshot detection system would probably be a good thing, but I find SoundThinking (manufacturer of the ShotSpotter system) to be profoundly untrustworthy. Futures The changes we are already seeing will continue: ALPR will become more ubiquitous, facial recognition will advance further into the public sphere, and the tech industry will continue to centralize data and facilitate queries by law enforcement. There's a lot of money to me made out of the whole thing, and funding towards law enforcement or public safety purchases are usually politically safe. Pretty much everything is stacked in the direction of more pervasive surveillance in the United States. Do you find that upsetting? It seems that some people do, and some people do not. I am probably not as opposed to surveillance of public spaces as the most vocal privacy advocates, but I am also convinced that vendor-enabled mass surveillance technology like Flock is subject to enormous abuse and will inevitably undermine constitutional protections. Unfortunately, vocal organizing against mass surveillance has become pretty limited. The ACLU is doing a lot of good work in this area, but I don't see much public organizing. The best thing you can do is probably to advocate for transparency. The most alarming part of this whole thing, to me, is the way that police departments have brazenly structured purchases of surveillance technology to get around public record and approval requirements. Companies like Flock and SoundThinking encourage this, and write it into their contracts. The end result is that many police departments have installed cameras and microphones in all kinds of places, and will not disclose when, where, how many, or how they are used. We should not allow that kind of secrecy, but preventing it seems to require legislation. The federal situation seems like a loss, so the best pressure point might be to lobby for municipal or state legislation that will require police departments to disclose their surveillance programs. Even better would be a requirement for review and approval of surveillance purchases, but unfortunately that kind of rule often already exists and police departments still structure their purchase arrangements to avoid invoking it. I suppose the bottom line is this: keep bringing it up. Mass surveillance in the US often feels like a lost cause, but I suppose it's only lost if we give up. It doesn't take that many people showing up at a city council meeting to make something a priority to the councilors; and perhaps the police can only stonewall for so long. It's worth a shot.",

    "title": "Was ist Federated Identity Management?",
    "summary": "Federated Identity optimiert Komfort und Sicherheit auf Kosten der Komplexität. PeachShutterStock | shutterstock.com Im Kern der Enterprise Security steht die Zerreißprobe zwischen Benutzerkomfort und Security-Anforderungen. Dabei handelt es sich um einen Balanceakt, der regelmäßig auf Authentifizierungsebene ausgetragen wird und sich direkt auf das Onboarding- und Anmeldeerlebnis auswirkt. Geht es darum diesen Konflikt aufzulösen, steht Federated Identity an vorderster Front: Sie kann eine gute User Experience bieten, ohne dabei das Sicherheitsniveau zu beeinträchtigen. Federated Identity Management – Definition Identity & Access Management ( IAM ) ist der übergeordnete Bereich, in dem es um digitale Identitäten und Zugriffsmanagement geht. Federated Identity Management (oder förderiertes Identitätsmanagement) ist eine IAM-Kategorie, die darauf fokussiert, ein einziges Authentifizierungsereignis sicher zu ermöglichen, um mehrere Interaktionen oder den Austausch von Identitätsinformationen abzudecken. Mit anderen Worten: Federated Identity Management (FIM) ermöglicht vielen Diensten, eine einzige digitale Identität gemeinsam zu nutzen. Ein Beispiel für den praktischen Einsatz von FIM wäre, wenn Sie sich bei Twitter mit ihrem Google-Konto anmelden. Föderiertes Identitätsmanagement kann der Benutzererfahrung, der allgemeinen Sicherheit und der Ausfallsicherheit zuträglich sein. Dafür gilt es, folgende Kompromisse einzugehen: erhöhte architektonische Komplexität, Bindung an einen bestimmten Anbieter und mögliche Servicekosten. Federated Identity Management wird bisweilen mit Single Sign-On (SSO) in einen Topf geworfen. Genau genommen ist SSO allerdings eine Funktion von FIM – und einer seiner wesentlichen Use Cases, den wir im Folgenden näher betrachten. Zuvor noch ein Hinweis: Das Thema Self-Sovereign Identity (oder dezentrale Identität ) ist wieder eine andere Baustelle . Anwendungsfall (Federated) Single-Sign On Man unterscheidet zwei Arten von Single Sign-on: Einerseits das, was für Anwendungen innerhalb einer einzelnen Organisation gilt, und andererseits das, was organisationsübergreifend gilt. Ersteres wird in der Regel einfach als Single Sign-on bezeichnet, manchmal auch als “Enterprise Single Sign-on”. Letzteres fällt unter den Begriff Federated Single Sign-on (FSSO). Die High-Level-Architektur, um beide SSO-Formen abzudecken, sieht folgendermaßen aus: Der Blick auf eine High-Level-SSO-Architektur. Foto: Foundry / Matthew Tyson In jedem Fall erfordert Federated Identity Management eine zentrale Institution, die die gemeinsamen Anmeldeinformationen zwischen den verschiedenen Diensten vermittelt. Dabei kann es sich um einen Identity Manager handeln, der: von der Organisation selbst erstellt wurde (etwa unter Verwendung von Active Directory ). über einen Identitätsanbieter in unterschiedlichem Umfang bereitgestellt wird. Enterprise Single Sign-on deckt oft Situationen ab, in denen sich Mitarbeiter mehrfach bei internen Systemen anmelden müssen, beispielsweise an HR-Portal und IT-Ticketsystem. Dieses Konzept birgt offensichtliche UX-, aber auch systemische Probleme, weil Identitätsinformationen über heterogene Systeme verteilt werden. Dieser Umstand beeinträchtigt die Sicherheit und erschwert es, Richtlinien durchzusetzen. So müssen etwa bei On- und Off-Boarding eines Mitarbeiters gleich zwei verschiedene Datenspeicher geändert werden. Federated Single Sign-on ermöglicht die gemeinsame Nutzung von Anmeldeinformationen über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg. Als solches stützt es sich in der Regel auf eine große, gut etablierte Einheit mit weitreichendem Trust – beispielsweise Google, Microsoft oder Amazon. Selbst eine kleine Applikation kann relativ einfach um die Option “Anmelden bei Google” ergänzt werden und den Nutzern eine einfache Anmeldemöglichkeit bieten, bei der sensible Informationen in den Händen der großen Organisation bleiben. Federated SSO implementieren Der Aufbau einer Federated SSO-Lösung richtet sich nach den jeweils spezifischen Anforderungen. Die allgemeinen Schritte sind dabei jedoch identisch: Identity Provider einrichten: Entweder, Sie stellen eine zentralisierte Identity Infrastructure bereit oder Sie richten ein Konto bei einem Federated-Identity-Anbieter ein (Google, Microsoft, Okta). Auch eine Möglichkeit: Sie kreieren eine Mischform. Provider mit Anwendungsinformationen füttern: So konfigurieren Sie den Identity Provider und schaffen die Grundlage, dass sich Applikationen mit dem Anbieter verbinden können. Provider-Anmeldeinformationen hinzufügen: Diese werden Sie im nächsten Schritt verwenden, um Ihren Anwendungen mitzuteilen, wie sie sich authentifizieren sollen. Applikationen einrichten: In Ihrem Anwendungscode fügen Sie Abhängigkeiten für die Authentifizierung und Interaktion mit dem Identity-Provider-Service hinzu. Neue Authentifizierung integrieren: Mit dem konfigurierten SSO-Service haben Ihre Benutzer eine Möglichkeit, sich zu authentifizieren. Das funktioniert auch in “transparent”: Anwendungen erkennen und authentifizieren User mit einer Live-Session bei einem anderen Service automatisch. Weil es eine einfache Lösung ist, entscheiden sich die meisten Unternehmen heute für einen Cloud Identity Provider im Rahmen eines SaaS-Angebots – sowohl, wenn es um Enterprise als auch wenn es um Federated SSO geht. SSO-Protokolle implementieren Für SSO-Interaktionen werden im Wesentlichen drei Protokolle verwendet: SAML , OIDC und OAuth 2.0 . Je nachdem, welches Protokoll der von Ihnen verwendete Identity-Anbieter unterstützt, werden Sie eines davon verwenden, um die sicheren Token-Informationen zwischen Ihren Anwendungen zu übermitteln. Jedes der Protokolle stellt einen offenen Standard dar, der auf einen bestimmten Anwendungsfall ausgerichtet ist. SAML ist ein XML-basiertes Protokoll, das häufig in Unternehmen verwendet wird, um Enterprise SSO zu unterstützen oder um zwischen verschiedenen Business-Service-Anbietern hin- und herzuspringen. Es kann auch für die allgemeine gemeinsame Nutzung von Identitäten verwendet werden, einschließlich Federated SSO (insofern der Identity Provider das unterstützt). OAuth 2.0 ist ein Authentifizierungsprotokoll, das die gemeinsame Nutzung von Ressourcendaten zwischen Anbietern auf der Grundlage der Zustimmung des Benutzers ermöglicht. Oauth fokussiert auf die gemeinsame Nutzung der Authentifizierung zwischen Diensten ohne die Angabe von Anmeldeinformationen. OIDC (OpenID Connect ) stellt eine auf OAuth 2.0 aufbauende Schicht dar, die in der Regel für Social Logins (etwa “Sign in with GitHub”) verwendet wird. OIDC enthält einige Erweiterungen gegenüber OAuth, einschließlich Identity Assertions, Userinfo API und Standard Discovery – standardisierte Mechanismen für die sichere Bereitstellung und Nutzung von Identitätsinformationen. Diese Protokolle kommen einzeln oder im Kombination mit anderen Technologien zum Einsatz. So können beispielsweise JSON Web Token verwendet werden, um OAuth 2.0 Credential Token-Informationen in einem sichereren Format zu kapseln. Glücklicherweise ist der Prozess zur Implementierung dieser Protokolle umfassend dokumentiert und wird von einer Vielzahl von Technologie-Stacks unterstützt. Der größte Teil der Arbeit wird durch Abstraktionen auf höherer Ebene in vielen Sprachen und Frameworks gekapselt. Spring Security bietet beispielsweise SSO-Unterstützung, ebenso wie Passport im NodeJS/Express-Ökosystem. (fm) Sie wollen weitere interessante Beiträge rund um das Thema IT-Sicherheit lesen?

    "title": "Was bei der Cloud-Konfiguration schiefläuft – und wie es besser geht",
    "summary": "Fehlerhaft konfigurierte Cloud-Dienste sorgen regelmäßig für Datenlecks – und schlimmeres. DC Studio | shutterstock.com Konfigurationsfehler in der Cloud, die Unternehmensdaten gefährden, sind nicht unbedingt etwas Neues – eher im Gegenteil . Umso schlimmer, dass Unternehmen ihre Cloud-Ressourcen immer noch nicht durchgängig absichern. Zumindest legt das ein aktueller Report nahe. Dafür hat der Cloud-Sicherheitsanbieter Qualys 101 Cybersecurity- und IT-Profis befragt, zu deren Aufgaben es gehört, Cloud-Umgebungen abzusichern. Demnach: haben 28 Prozent der Befragten im vergangenen Jahr einen Breach in Zusammenhang mit der Cloud oder SaaS-Applikationen verzeichnet. sehen 24 Prozent falsch konfigurierte Services als das größte Risiko für ihre Cloud-Umgebung an. Qualys nahm für seine Studie außerdem rund 44 Millionen virtuelle Maschinen ( VMs ) unter die Lupe, die in Public Clouds gehostet werden. Dabei stellten die Experten fest, dass 45 Prozent der AWS-VMs, 63 Prozent der GCP-VMs und 70 Prozent der Azure-VMs über falsch konfigurierte Ressourcen verfügten. Die häufigsten Cloud-Konfigurationsfehler Laut Ayan Roy , Leiter des Bereichs Cybersicherheit bei EY Americas, aktivieren Unternehmen zwar durchaus bestimmte Cloud-Security-Funktionen, allerdings nicht alle. So blieben Logging, Monitoring und Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung ( MFA ) in vielen Fällen unbeachtet: “Unternehmen wollen schnell vorankommen, und die Time-to-Value ist absolut entscheidend. Wenn Cybersicherheitsteams jedoch nicht in diese Entscheidungen eingebunden werden, beginnen die Probleme. So können die Sicherheitsprofis oft nur nachträglich Maßnahmen ergreifen.” Einen weiteren blinden Fleck in Sachen Cloud Security sieht Roy während Fusionen und Übernahmen . Er mahnt Unternehmen dazu, in solchen Fällen proaktiv vorzugehen: “Führen Sie eine Due Diligence durch, berücksichtigen Sie diese auch und stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie den richtigen Cybersecurity-Investitionsplan haben.” Laut Scott Wheeler , Cloud Practice Lead bei Asperitas, treten mit steigender Unternehmensgröße auch weniger Cloud-Konfigurationsfehler auf. Das liegt laut dem Cloud-Experten vor allem an der Aufsicht durch Regulierungsbehörden. Kleine Firmen hätten hingegen enorme Probleme, da sie weder über das Personal noch die nötigen Tools verfügten, um Risiken im Zusammenhang mit der Cloud-Konfiguration zu managen – etwa exponierte Speicher-Buckets oder Web Services. “Das gesamte Konzept von Zero Trust basiert auf der Tatsache, dass man den Zugriff auf das benötigte Minimum beschränken kann. Aber das ist in der Praxis schwer zu bewerkstelligen”, erklärt Wheeler. Oftmals würden während der Entwicklung Berechtigungen erweitert und nach der Inbetriebnahme nicht wieder zurückgesetzt, wie er beispielhaft anführt. Der regelmäßig größte Fehler, den Wheeler beobachtet, sind jedoch Datenbanken oder andere Cloud-Assets, die über nicht sichere, private Netzwerke kommunizieren. “Viele dieser Services unterstützen das nicht ‘out of the box’. Es erfordert einiges an Arbeit, sie so zu konfigurieren, dass ausschließlich privater Netzwerkverkehr in private Cloud- oder lokale Umgebungen fließt. Das ist ein großes Problem, das oft von kriminellen Hackern ausgenutzt wird.” Und auch wenn viele Anbieter versprechen, dass KI auch Cloud Security einfacher, kostengünstiger und effektiver gestalten wird: Sie sollten nicht damit rechnen, dass Cloud-Konfigurationsprobleme schon morgen der Vergangenheit angehören. Bis KI-Agenten soweit sind, dass sie das zuverlässig übernehmen können, wird noch ein bisschen Zeit ins Land ziehen. 9 Tipps für sicherere Cloud-Konfigurationen Tun können Sie dennoch etwas gegen fehlerhafte Cloud-Konfigurationen. Zum Beispiel: 1. Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung implementieren MFA sollte für jede Form von Cloud-Zugriff zur Anwendung kommen, nicht nur für bestimmte Benutzer. 2. Private Netzwerke für alle Services nutzen Konfigurieren Sie Datenbanken und Cloud-Dienste so, dass sie nur über private Netzwerke und nicht über das öffentliche Internet kommunizieren. 3. Daten verschlüsseln Datenverschlüsselung sollte für alle neuen und bestehenden Ressourcen standardmäßig aktiviert sein. Angesichts des nahenden Quanten-Zeitalters empfiehlt es sich für Unternehmen bereits jetzt auf quantensichere Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen zu setzen, um sich gegen sogenannte “Harvest now, decrypt later”-Angriffe zu schützen. 4. Least-Privilege-Zugriffskontrollen anwenden Benutzern und Systemen Zugriff auf möglichst wenige Ressourcen zu gewähren, ist ein Grundpfeiler moderner Zero-Trust-Sicherheitsprinzipien. Konten mit übermäßigen Berechtigungen können schnell zu Datenverlust führen, wenn sie missbraucht werden. 5. Infrastructure as Code verwenden Wenn Administratoren oder Benutzer Änderungen an Cloud-Konfigurationen in den Cloud-Management-Konsolen vornehmen, ist es oft schwierig, diese nachzuvollziehen – und rückgängig zu machen, wenn etwas schiefgeht. Das Prinzip von Infrastructure as Code hilft an dieser Stelle: Verwenden Sie entsprechende Konfigurationsmanagement-Tools, um sämtliche Änderungen anhand von Richtlinien zu überprüfen, nachzuverfolgen und auditieren zu können. 6. Kontinuierlich scannen Einmal bei der Ersteinrichtung der Cloud-Ressourcen zu überprüfen, ob die Konfigurationen aktuell sind, reicht nicht aus. Unternehmen müssen sicherstellen, dass sich nichts verändert. Zu diesem Zweck haben einige Cloud-Anbieter native Tools im Angebot. Lösungen aus dem Bereich Cloud Security Posture Management ( CSPM ) können außerdem dabei unterstützen, Lücken zu schließen oder Multi-Cloud-Umgebungen zu überwachen. 7. Speicher-Buckets sperren Unsichere Amazon-S3-Buckets waren vor einigen Jahren bei Cyberkriminellen sehr populär – und sind nach wie vor ein gängiges Problem für Unternehmen. Um sicherzustellen, dass der Storage standardmäßig privat ist, empfehlen sich Bucket Policies und -Zugriffskontrollen. 8. Logging und Monitoring einziehen Viele Unternehmen überwachen essenzielle Cloud Services, dabei bleibt Schatten-IT jedoch oft außen vor. Das ist weniger ein technologisches, als vielmehr ein Management-Problem und lässt sich durch bessere Kommunikation mit den Geschäftsbereichen und einen disziplinierteren Ansatz bei der Bereitstellung von Technologien lösen. 9. Security by Design verinnerlichen Integrieren Sie Sicherheit von Anfang an in Ihre Cloud-Architektur – es ist immer deutlich schwieriger, nachträglich aufzurüsten.

Recently started a new job in the department overseeing GRC at a start up of close to 600 people with only ONE outsourced security engineer based in India. This person has made very obvious and simple mistakes such as blocking addresses from our security awareness platform. This has been brought to management’s attention, who has used every excuse to not replace them or hire someone with some degree of competence. Not sure what needs to be done if management turns a blind eye. I have since learned this person has been in this role for nearly 2 years.

    "title": "Best practices for building a multilingual vulnerability dataset (Java priority, Python secondary) for detection + localization (DL filter + LLM analyzer)?",
    "summary": "I’m working on a research project to build a multilingual dataset for software vulnerability detection and localization , with Java as the top priority and Python as a secondary language . The end goal is a two-stage system : Stage 1 (DL filter): high-recall screening to reduce the search space Stage 2 (LLM analyzer): deeper reasoning to reduce false positives and localize vulnerable code (function/line/path) I want to collect data “the right way” so it’s reproducible, legally shareable, and actually useful for training and evaluation. What I’m trying to collect For each sample (Java-first, plus Python), I’m aiming for: Vulnerable code + fixed code (before/after) Mapping to CWE (and optionally CVE/CVSS) Localization labels : vulnerable file(s)/function(s), ideally line-level or hunk-level evidence A mix of real-world and synthetic cases (to cover rare CWEs) Current collection ideas (but I’m unsure about best practice) CVE → repo → fixing commit → diff → affected files/functions/lines Concern: noisy CVE-to-commit mapping, missing links, multi-commit fixes, refactors, backports. Security test suites / synthetic corpora Concern: distribution shift vs real-world code; overfitting to templated patterns. Advisories / vulnerability databases Use NVD/GHSA vendor advisories as metadata, but I’m unsure what pipelines people trust most in practice. Questions for people who’ve built datasets or trained vuln models A) Data sourcing & mapping (Java-heavy) What’s your most reliable pipeline for CVE/CWE ↔ GitHub repo ↔ fixing commit ? Do you anchor on fixing commits or vulnerability-introducing commits ? Why? Heuristics to reduce mapping errors (keyword filters, issue linking rules, tag matching, release notes)? B) Labeling for localization What’s considered “good enough” labeling today? diff-hunk only? line-level? slicing-based labels? source→sink path evidence? How do you handle fixes that are config/build changes or dependency updates (no clear line-level change)? C) Dataset hygiene (leakage prevention) Best practice to prevent leakage via: duplicated code across forks backported patches across branches train/test overlap from the same project/vendor Recommended split strategy: by project , by time , by vendor , or combinations? D) Negative samples How do you sample “clean” code without making labels unreliable? random functions? same files pre-fix? post-fix only? using static analyzers to filter negatives?

    "title": "These are the AI security concerns and design considerations affecting enterprise projects",
    "summary": "Since leaving my career as a cybersecurity consultant and incident responder, I've been contracting 1-2 days a week with a few different enterprises in the financial sector. My role with them is to work with architects and developers to ensure their new AI projects are secure. These are not SMBs, they're firms with 20,000+ employees. So things here are quite different compared to what's happening at frontier startups (which I'm also involved with!). It's all been a challenge. For a few reasons. But here is a summary of what I've learned over the past 6 months. - AI is no different to any technology project. The biggest issue with these initiatives - by far - continues to be the traditional technology issues we all know about. Secure landing zones. SSDLC. Developer permissions. Peer review processes. Dependency management. AI is being used by developers as an excuse to \"move fast and break things\" and build outside of approved environments. This flexibility is key (and my job is to support that), but it has taken months of work to go from a developer-POC through to a production deployment. Arguably (in my opinion), developers are not doing themselves any favours by pushing for less-restrictive development environments. If they had stuck to approved environments in the first place, and worked with security to handle the exceptions, I think the overall process would have been considerably smoother and the end result better. - The biggest AI-specific security issues have come down to early or unproven technology. Microsoft have really let down the community by releasing tools like Promptflow, and then completely abandoning them. Not only that, there are uncountable issues with Promptflow itself and ultimately despite being very cool and very useful, it's not suited for production environments. But it took some time to work this out, and that was time we wasted. For those interested, everyone I know has basically adopted LLamaIndex as their AI-orchestration layer. It's not perfect, but I can see a world where it becomes the standard. I personally prefer (in my own projects) to use LiteLLM + a custom prompt renderer based on jinja2. I just feel that is far more flexible, and right now, I don't hugely trust what the opensource community is publishing in this space. However, I understand that most developers want a framework to engage with. - All projects I've dealt with have been limited to coarse-grain authorisation. Right now, fine-grain authorisation is a practical impossibility. Take a simple RAG example. You want to be able to query a document store, and, because you're dealing with complex enterprise environments, it's not something \"easy\" like SharePoint. How do you ensure that if Bob queries the AI for data, it doesn't return information from data that Bob doesn't have access to? There are really two primary approaches. You can either ingest all your information from the datastore into your index and include the permission structure. Your AI knows who the user is, and they know what access permissions that user has, which means they can limit their queries accordingly. But it means you have a potentially unacceptable cache invalidation issue. If Bob's permissions change, it will take time for this to be replicated in the index. The second approach would be to use middleware. Your index contains all possible information, your search retrieves what it considers relevant, and then queries the original datastore to workout if Bob shouldn't have access to any of it. The second approach is my preference. But it's considered higher-risk, because you're allowing the agentic search function to query data without restrictions. Furthermore, how do we scale this to accommodate multiple datastores, each potentially backed by different identity providers? We need solutions in this space to architect that middleware layer translating user permissions into agentic query parameters. I'm aware there are several startups in this space. The point I'm trying to make is that enterprises have no interest in solving this problem themselves, they're waiting for other people to solve it. And in the meantime, they're limiting the scope of their projects accordingly. - Classified data poses existential problems. In IT, the person administrating your SharePoint does not (and should not) have access to the actual files. They don't need it. Their job is to manage the tenant, not view your secret data. So what happens when we want AI to access information that's classified? We don't really care that the LLM \"sees\" that information, because the session is ephemeral. The issue is more complex. The developers themselves are not authorised to access that data. So how can they diagnose issues with AI responses, when the input data makes up the majority of the prompt? How do we spot hallucinations? If the input data is classified, does that mean the output data is also classified? These are serious problems! I don't have any solutions right now. I've speculated about a process whereby classified information is logged but encrypted at rest. When a developer wants to access that information to diagnose an event, they can request access and decrypt the data. This would mean there is a strong audit trail of who sees what, and we can tie the access request to a business justification for accessing that content. But it's still not ideal. The second method I've played around with is focusing instead on quantifying the performance of the AI. For example, can we develop a machine learning model that provides output floats modelling the hallucination likelihood or the overall quality of the AI response? Such a framework would provide the developers with information about the session performance without needing to access the underlying data. I haven't come across any startups yet in that space. But I'm also not convinced it's a workable idea. - I'm not going to talk about MCP! I personally do not believe in it, and I'm challenging any developers who build solutions that involve it. However, there is a much larger security point here about how we log and audit unattended user actions. My initial security theories about MCP were pretty simple. If Alice has access to Jira (for example), and can create/read/modify content there legitimately - why do we care if she uses MCP (or equivalent) to perform actions she's already authorised to perform? I didn't really see an issue with users sharing their permissions in this way. It's no different than them automating part of their work using a python script. However, the release of agentic browsers in particular has changed that conversation a bit. The potential for unattended and unguided user actions is now very high, and this create a real issue for security telemetry. We simply do not know if an action has been performed by a user or an agent anymore. That's highly concerning, and I think is a real issue we need solutions for. It's difficult to say exactly how this can be done. We already have standards for logging machine-to-machine connections with something like an `impersonating` or `on-behalf-of-user` field. But when agents are interacting in the front end, there's no mechanism for them to pass that information through to the server. Perhaps instead of Captchas, we need to accept that agents will become the norm and require them to acknowledge that \"they are a robot\". Then the session telemetry can appropriately capture the information we need. ---- Hopefully this all makes sense! Would love to hear about what other people are dealing with and whether any of this resonates. submitted by /u/QoTSankgreall [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Hey everyone, A while back, I posted about a tool I was building to help automate security analysis. To be honest, the previous version wasn't ready. Like many AI wrappers, it suffered from \"hallucinations\" it would sometimes invent open ports or give generic advice that wasn't relevant to the actual scan. I spent the last few weeks rebuilding the Nmap engine from scratch. I wanted to share the v1.0 release (Nmap Module). Video Demo: https://youtu.be/HeaNJErRuXI The \"Anti-Hallucination\" Update Instead of blindly sending Nmap output to an LLM, I built a Pattern Matching Engine (in Python) that parses the scan before the AI sees it. Hallucination Blocking: If you ask the Syd about a service (e.g., \"How do I exploit SMB?\") that does not exist in the actual Nmap scan, the engine detects the mismatch and blocks the response. It refuses to lie to you. Risk Scoring: It parses the flags and versions to differentiate between a \"Low Risk\" Port 80 (Default Apache) and a \"High Risk\" Port 445 (SMB Signing Disabled).Quiet Indicators: It specifically highlights \"quiet\" risks that LLMs often miss, like Port 111 (RPC) or Port 631 (CUPS). The Test I tested it against a vulnerable Windows Domain Controller (10.10.10.20). Generic AI: Often misses context or hallucinates extra services. Syd correctly identified it as a DC, flagged the lack of SMB signing (Relay Attack risk), and refused to answer questions about services that weren't there. This is currently just for Nmap analysis, but I'm working on adding BloodHound and Volatility 3 modules next hopefully today and this will be open source and completley free of charge the video is quite long and i hate the sound of my accent but it needs to be long because there are 30 questions that i asked syd about the scan and i also asked some generic questions, i would sugest pausing the video and reading the answers he gives and remember this is 100% airgapped id love feed back on this and he will be on github today submitted by /u/Glass-Ant-6041 [link] [comments]",

So I've set up a shell script that will collect all 404 errors on the server and total hits by IP address. The script then detects who controls the IP address, and if it's Microsoft, it emails a report to [ abuse@microsoft.com ](mailto: abuse@microsoft.com ) when an IP hits 100 404 errors across all websites on the server. I have this script running every 15 minutes. I've never received any responses for the emails sent to [ abuse@microsoft.com ](mailto: abuse@microsoft.com ). In the past 24 hours, 56 Microsoft identified IPs were conducting probing attacks. The problem is that this never ends. The IPs constantly shift. Previously, I was manually blocking by /24 blocks, but it was too much work to constantly be adding blocks to the firewall, so the script is supposed to handle this, but the attacks and high server load continue. I literally just temporarily blocked 4.0.0.0/8 and 20.0.0.0/8 just to kill off an attack. MS has many blocks in those two subnets. Usually, about five times a day, my server is unavailable or degraded due to these probing attacks. A couple days ago, that was ten times that the server was bogged down with these attacks. This wasn't a problem a couple years ago, but now it's a major issue. Conversely, when I report these to AWS or Google, they are dealt with quickly. I've tried to figure out a way to speak with someone at MS about this. I called the number listed with ICANN and managed to figure out how to search by name, and by trying common last names found actual extensions to call (as well as conference rooms). I have yet to actually connect with a human doing this, even when calling someone's direct extension. I've found others complaining on Microsoft's help forums, and the MS response completely got it wrong, thinking that the their Azure server was being attacked, not that Azure IPs were attacking an outside server. When corrected on this, the MS rep said that they needed an Azure account for help in that matter (completely sidestepping the issue). How best to handle this situation? submitted by /u/exitof99 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "What would make someone a ‘senior’ cybersecurity analyst",
    "summary": "Hi everyone, As the title implies, i’m looking for opinions from the community on what brings someone from a regular ‘cybersecurity analyst’ to a ‘senior’ analyst. For backstory, i’ve been an analyst for 2.5 years. I mentioned to my manager I want to look towards becoming a senior analyst down the road. What confuses me (and my manager) is that they don’t have a roadmap/plan for what would imply from going from regular to senior. My review stated I excelled for almost all categories, so, I got a decent raise. However since there is no ‘goalpost’ for what brings you to senior, I don’t know (nor management) what would classify a senior analyst. My question to the community is- what (in your opinion) are topics, tasks, knowledge, etc should/would distinguish someone from a ‘analyst’ to ‘senior’ analyst? Notes: i’m primarily IR for my company. My manager had ‘no’ feedback for growth Edit: Size of company is >10,000 employees, global Thanks! H submitted by /u/Evocablefawn566 [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I’m not pitching or selling anything here — genuinely trying to stress-test the idea before going further. Brutal honesty welcome :D ####### I’m working on an idea for a crowdsourced SOC alert triage platform , and I’d really like feedback from people who’ve worked in SOCs, MDRs, IR teams, or built security products. The problem I’m trying to solve Most SOCs I’ve seen are: Drowning in alerts (often ~60–70% false positives) Struggling to hire/retain analysts (cost + burnout) Forced to choose between 24/7 coverage and budget reality Spending senior analyst time on low-value triage work Automation helps, but fully automated triage still misses nuance and creates risk. The core idea A global, on-demand SOC triage platform where: Sensitive information within the alert is redacted (never raw logs) Real human analysts triage alerts (L1/L2/L3) Verdicts are returned quickly (FP / TP / needs escalation) Companies pay per alert or via subscription The key principle: human judgment, without exposing sensitive data . How it would work (high level) A lightweight, open-source agent integrates with an existing SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, etc.) Redaction happens client-side , before anything leaves the company Only the specific alert context is shared (not full log streams) Alerts go into a queue Vetted analysts pick them up, triage, and submit a verdict Results flow back to the client SOC Redaction & privacy (this is the main differentiator) The platform is built around smart, context-aware redaction : Usernames, emails → replaced with placeholders IPs → masked or partially masked Secrets, tokens, passwords → auto-detected (regex/YARA-like rules) Command lines → sensitive substrings redacted, not entire fields (e.g. keep mimikatz.exe , redact -p MySecret123 ) Clients can define custom redaction rules per field or log source Clients see a preview of exactly what analysts will see No raw logs, no full environments, no PII by default. Trust & quality controls To avoid “random internet analysts” problems: Analysts must register, pass technical tests, KYC, and NDAs Tiered analysts (L1/L2/L3) Reputation system based on accuracy, speed, and client feedback Time limits per alert (idle alerts auto-returned) Random quality checks and audits Underperformance leads to demotion or removal Clients also retain control: Decline info requests Resolve alerts internally Escalate to senior analysts Full audit trail of who accessed what Compliance angle Designed with GDPR/CCPA in mind: Client remains data controller Platform is processor Regional analyst pools (EU-only, etc.) Configurable retention / auto-deletion Human-in-the-loop (no purely automated decisions) The open questions (where I want Reddit’s help) Would SOC teams actually trust this model? Is client-side redaction + partial context enough for good triage? (should the redaction happen before the alert reaches the platform or after ) Where do you see this breaking down in real life? Would MDRs see this as competition, or as overflow capacity? Is this solving a real pain, or just shifting it? submitted by /u/Main-Sweet-5735 [link] [comments]",

My friend and I scoped online to see if there were any options of solving this. There were some websites that detect AI on videos but they need to be uploaded, and YT videos can’t be downloaded in a legal way. As for the deepfake image detectors, I think that would be too inconvenient for the user, and often I would use snipping tool from the video, feed it into the program and it would detect no AI generated content. Would it be much easier to paste a video link and get a probability that the content is AI generated? since I assume people don’t like to be fooled into thinking they are watching something real when it really is not.

I don't know about other countries, but if you want to get into cyber, there are only two things you should have: either some experience in IT fields or a better recognition certificate (paid one, of course). If you don't have either, like a fresher or you don't have money to pursue those certs, the reality is you can't get in, no matter how much projects you have made, no matter how much hands-on experience you will get on multiple skills. It's not about particularly SOC or cloud security, it's about all fields. I am trying literally for 5–6 months, daily applying to up to 100 companies a day, and since then I was not able to get my resume shortlisted. No, it's not about my resume being bad or not having keywords, as a fresher I really do have a better resume than that. But they only want those two things only. After applying for months, I get a chance to get a cybersecurity intern role in a, let's say, XYZ company, and it's a good company, not like a little organisation. The HR called me and said we have scheduled your interview, but later on the interview day, HR called me and said we have to reschedule. Again, on the rescheduled day, I get a call and they said the panel is not available, and this time they didn't give me any reschedule. Hence, it clearly shows they don't want me right now. I really had a hope with this organisation that now I can for sure start my career, but again it shows that as a fresher you really don't have any value. ;) I tried to do other fields, but what led me into cyber is that I like it. Upon contacting and trying to make a network through people on LinkedIn, trust me, you will only waste your time. Neither one person out of 800 helped me. Later on, they all said move on to some other field, later on jump, and I was stunned. Like, if I wanted to do other things, why would I even enter into cyber? But you know guys, after such things, I am getting tired. I don't have it left in me anymore to continue cyber. So if you are a fresher, you can get a job only if you are lucky, nothing else. And as a fresher, I don't mean you had done an internship. I had a 6 months+ internship period, which really, you know, didn't hold a value. So that's all.

I wrote an article reversing CVE 2025-55182 (React2Shell), my writing is full of memes and jokes because I personally find that technical writeups feel less tiring to read if you smile, but I dont know if my work is gonna be downgraded due to the humoristic quotes ? I don't see too much cybersecurity articles with humoristic tones and I dont know if perhaps I should write formal articles so the work is not downgraded... For example this article: https://blog.kapeka.dev/cve2025-55182-exp/ Would you feel less serious a research if it has memes and humoristic quotes ?

    "title": "Looking for fitting mystery guest certification",
    "summary": "Hi everyone, I’m a 24-year-old cybersecurity and information security consultant working for a company in the Netherlands. I hold an HBO-level education and my main area of expertise is social engineering, with a strong focus on mystery guest and physical security assessments for clients. Currently, I’m the only employee performing these types of projects. Our team was reduced from six people to just me, mainly to move away from multiple individual working styles and to allow the others to focus on long-term projects such as (C)ISO-related work. Regarding physical security, my goal is to move toward an approach where I not only perform the physical tests (such as mystery guest or intrusion-style assessments), but also expand into providing advisory input on the theoretical and organizational side based on the findings. At the moment, my role is limited to executing the assessments and delivering the final report. I’d like to further develop my skills and deepen my expertise by obtaining a certification this year (or however long it realistically takes). However, I’m finding it difficult to identify certifications that truly fit this niche. I’ve broadened my search beyond mystery guest and physical security to certifications focused on social engineering, ideally including the psychological or human-factor aspects, while still remaining rooted in security testing. OSINT certs like added aren’t relevant enough, since there isn’t enough interest from clients. Most psychology-oriented certifications are unfortunately not an option for me, as they require an HBO diploma with a psychology background. My background is in cybersecurity, and I’d prefer something that builds on that. Practical constraints: • Budget: ~€5,000 (with some flexibility if there’s a strong case) • Time: I work full-time (40 hours), run my own business on the side, and have a private life, so anything requiring extreme workloads (e.g. 100+ hours/week) is not realistic • Format: Online is preferred unless the training is located in the Netherlands or nearby regions in Belgium or Germany • Language: English or Dutch I don’t currently hold any certifications in this specific area. Does anyone have experience with certifications related to social engineering, human factors, or physical security testing that would fit this profile? Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated. submitted by /u/Joepus16 [link] [comments]",

I noticed the production key files (public and private) were almost identical size. I re-exported the public key from my local machine, and noticed the key blocks do not match. The public key block in question is about double the size of the one I just exported. For the life of me, I can't figure out what went wrong the first time I exported.

TL;DR for engineering teams What broke MongoDB’s zlib decompression path trusts attacker-controlled length metadata. Impact Unauthenticated heap memory disclosure. What leaks Raw process memory fragments including credentials, tokens, config strings, runtime metadata, and recently processed data. Auth required None. Noise level Low. No crashes. No malformed packets. Minimal logs. Exposure 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances observed via Shodan on 29 Dec 2025. Fix Upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression. Reality check Public PoC exists. Scanning is trivial. Exploitation effort is low (links below on the exploit lab, explaination and scanners if you want to find yours Links - Full Detailed Blog: https://phoenix.security/mongobleed-vulnerability-cve-2025-14847/ - Exploit explanation and lab: https://youtu.be/EZ4euRyDI8I - Exploit Description (llm generated from article): https://youtu.be/lxfNSICAaSc - Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main - Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner - Github Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca (Note I spend more time writing exploits, have dyslexia, and I'm not a native English, an LLM proofreads some sections, if this offends you, stop reading) Affected versions MongoDB Server Vulnerable versions Fixed versions 8.2.x 8.2.0 – 8.2.2 8.2.3 8.0.x 8.0.0 – 8.0.16 8.0.17 7.0.x 7.0.0 – 7.0.27 7.0.28 6.0.x 6.0.0 – 6.0.26 6.0.27 5.0.x 5.0.0 – 5.0.31 5.0.32 4.4.x 4.4.0 – 4.4.29 4.4.30 4.2.x All EOL 4.0.x All EOL 3.6.x All EOL SAAS version of MongoDB is already patched Technical anatomy MongoDB supports network-level message compression. When a client negotiates compression, each compressed message includes an uncompressedSize field. The vulnerable flow looks like this: Client sends a syntactically valid compressed MongoDB wire-protocol message Message declares an inflated uncompressedSize MongoDB allocates a heap buffer of that declared size zlib inflates only the real payload into the start of the buffer The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON BSON parsing walks past real data into leftover heap memory Memory gets leaked out, not a lot of IOC to detect Root cause (code-level) The vulnerability originates in MongoDB’s zlib message decompression logic: src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cpp In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returned: return {output.length()}; output.length() represents the allocated buffer size , not the number of bytes actually written by ::uncompress(). If the attacker declares a larger uncompressedSize than the real decompressed payload, MongoDB propagates the allocated size forward. Downstream BSON parsing logic consumes memory beyond the true decompression boundary. The fix replaces this with: return length; length is the actual number of bytes written by the decompressor. Additional regression tests were added in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly reject undersized decompression results with ErrorCodes::BadValue. This closes the disclosure path. Why is this reachable pre-auth Compression negotiation occurs before authentication. The exploit does not require: malformed compression streams memory corruption primitives race conditions timing dependencies It relies on: attacker-controlled metadata valid compression Incorrect length propagation Any network client can trigger it, hence is super easy to deploy Exploitation reality A working proof of concept exists and is public, more details: Original PoC by Joe Desimone https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed/ Technical analysis and reproduction details https://doublepulsar.com/merry-christmas-day-have-a-mongodb-security-incident-9537f54289eb Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca The PoC: negotiates compression sends crafted compressed messages iterates offsets dumps leaked memory fragments to disk and saves it locally No credentials required. No malformed packets. Repeatable probing. What actually leaks Heap memory is messy. That is the point. Observed and expected leak content includes: database credentials SCRAM material session tokens API keys WiredTiger config strings file paths container metadata client IPs and connection details fragments of recently processed documents The PoC output already shows real runtime artifacts. This is not RCE, but steals pieces of memory, which is not as bad as RCE but still very dangerous (Heartbleed anyone) MongoBleed does not provide native remote code execution. There is no instruction pointer control. No shellcode injection. No crash exploitation. What it provides is privilege discovery . Memory disclosure enables: credential reuse token replay service-to-service authentication CI/CD compromise cloud control plane access A leaked Kubernetes token is better than RCE. A leaked CI token is persistent RCE. A leaked cloud role is full environment control. This is RCE-adjacent through legitimate interfaces. How widespread is this MongoDB is everywhere. Shodan telemetry captured on 29 December 2025 shows: 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances Version breakdown (port 27017): Version Count Query All versions 201,659 product:\"MongoDB\" port:27017 8.2.x 3,164 \"8.2.\" 8.0.x (≠8.0.17) 13,411 \"8.0.\" -\"8.0.17\" 7.0.x (≠7.0.28) 19,223 \"7.0.\" -\"7.0.28\" 6.0.x (≠6.0.27) 3,672 \"6.0.\" -\"6.0.27\" 5.0.x (≠5.0.32) 1,887 \"5.0.\" -\"5.0.32\" 4.4.x (≠4.4.30) 3,231 \"4.4.\" -\"4.4.30\" 4.2.x 3,138 \"4.2.\" 4.0.x 3,145 \"4.0.\" 3.6.x 1,145 \"3.6.\" Most are directly exposed on the default port, not shielded behind application tiers. Core behaviors that matter Unauthenticated Any client can trigger it. Remote and repeatable Memory offsets can be probed over time. Low noise No crashes. Logs stay quiet. Data agnostic Whatever was on the heap becomes fair game. This favors patient actors and automation. Detection guidance IOC Identification Network-level signals Look for: Inbound traffic to port 27017 compressed MongoDB messages Repeated requests with: large declared uncompressedSize small actual payloads high request frequency without auth attempts Process-level signals Watch for: elevated CPU on mongod without query load repeated short-lived connections memory allocation spikes abnormal BSON parsing warnings Post-leak fallout Check for: new MongoDB users role changes admin command usage anomalies auth attempts from unfamiliar IPs API key failures cloud IAM abuse new outbound connections If you see filesystem artifacts or shells, you are already past exploitation. Temporary protections If you cannot upgrade immediately: Disable zlib compression Remove zlib from networkMessageCompressors Restrict network access Remove direct internet exposure Enforce allowlists These are stopgaps. The bug lives in the server - hence patch Tooling and validation A full test suite is available, combining: exploit lab (vulnerable + patched instances) network scanner code scanner for repos and Dockerfiles Repository: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847 This allows: safe reproduction exposure validation pre-deployment detection Why this one matters MongoBleed does not break crypto it breaks data and memory The database trusts client-supplied lengths. Attackers live for that assumption. Databases are part of your application attack surface. Infrastructure bugs leak application secrets. Vulnerability management without reachability is incomplete. Patch this. Then ask why it was reachable. submitted by /u/Diligent-Side4917 [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Context: attack surface reduction through disablement of gpu reliance. Process affected: Supermium 138 (chrome.exe). Action used: --disable-gpu in shortcut flags. Verification of gpu disablement: chrome://gpu. Observation and Mismatch: the Chrome settings indicate that hardware-assisted GPU acceleration is active despite the starting flag disables the GPU. If the action for disabling GPU acceleration is performed manually, after initiating chrome through the command-line flag that disabled the GPU, the UI for GPU acceleration is reset to active at every start of the browser. Discovery: enforcement occurs at process creation time, not policy declaration time. Boundary: GPU usage is enforced by process initiation and flag evaluation, with UI indicators being non-authoritative. Internal thoughts: Initially I assumed it a mistake, because the UI is not updated even if the policy is enforced elsewhere. Afterwards, I asked a cybersecurity architect for his opinion and he mentioned that this is the intentional design, because flags prevent tampering inside the process at run-time. submitted by /u/themagicalfire [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Happy New Year everyone! At the end of last year, my manager spoke to me about a new job role at the company for a 'Cyber Analyst'. We don't currently have one, so the company is a bit up in the air when it comes to job description and what they expect from the role. However, they've picked me out as a candidate for the role. It was said that they don't want me to leave the company and think this is a good opportunity, which it is. Although, I don't have any degree, qualifications or any proper experience within the Cyber field.. I'm 23 in the UK and my current job role is 'IT Support Technician', however it doesn't reflect what I do at all. My job consists of managing the network, backups, sharepoint, helpdesk, automation development, the whole Microsoft stack as well as other bits. So pretty varied. Company politics is why I'm still an IT Support Tech. The company is a great one to work for, pay is decent and they clearly think I do a good job since they're trying to promote me. The company has said they're happy to pay and have me do pretty much any relevant course or training or degree etc. However, as they haven't had a role like this before, they're leaving it up to me choose what to put myself on. They've said for me to come to them in the new year with a sort of rough plan and we can finalise things and get things set in motion. Hopefully you're not bored reading all of that, now my real question is what sort of certifications, qualifications etc are out there for me to do? and which ones do you recommend for my circumstance? I'm not wanting to go down the degree route as I don't want to tie myself down so was thinking more along the lines of a qualification or cert, but I'm just not sure whats out there or where to start looking. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks :) submitted by /u/lukedurston_ [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Snapshot: Predictions for 2026: AI Attack Acceleration, Automated Remediation, Custom-Made AI Security Tools, Machine Identity Threats, and More",
    "summary": "In this special edition, Tenable leaders forecast key 2026 trends, including: AI will make attacks more plentiful and less costly; machine identities will become the top cloud risk; preemptive cloud and exposure management will dethrone runtime detection; and automated remediation gets the go-ahead. Key takeaways AI will supercharge the speed and volume of traditional cyber attacks rather than creating new vectors, making basic cyber hygiene and proactive prevention the best lines of defense. To combat burnout and inefficient workflows, CISOs will look beyond commercial off-the-shelf solutions and begin building custom in-house AI tools tailored to their organization’s specific needs. Non-human identities (NHIs) will become the primary vector for cloud breaches, necessitating a shift toward strict permissions governance and automatic remediation. 1 - AI won’t spawn new attack vectors in 2026 Is artificial intelligence (AI) about to unleash a wave of never-before-seen cyber attacks? Not quite. While the hype machine might suggest otherwise, the reality for 2026 is grounded in a familiar truth: most bad actors are opportunists looking for low-hanging fruit. They don’t want to reinvent the wheel. Rather, they’re looking for easy wins that yield big gains with minimal effort. “AI is not a magic wand; it supercharges traditional attack methods,” Tenable Chief Product Officer Eric Doerr says. “It will drive down the cost of attack generation and increase the volume, and it might even find a new zero day or two, but it’s not finding novel attack techniques.” In response, cyber teams should double down on foundational cybersecurity practices to combat these high-volume, AI-enhanced threats. Tenable Chief Product Officer Eric Doerr As Doerr explains: \"At the end of the day, cybersecurity is a numbers game and AI broadens attackers’ canvas. Basic cyber hygiene remains the best defense.\" Prediction: In 2026, as attackers increase their use of AI, cyber attacks will grow in number and become less expensive to launch. However, attackers won’t leverage AI to create new attack vectors. 2 - Automatic remediation will get the green light For years, the idea of letting a machine automatically fix a security issue has been considered verboten. But in 2026, can we afford to keep \"automatic\" on the forbidden list? The expanding attack surface and the velocity of threats are forcing a reevaluation of this well-established no-no. “Automatic remediation, mobilization, and mitigation are no longer forbidden,” Tenable Chief Security Officer Robert Huber says. Embracing automation not just for detection, but for the actual fixing of problems, represents a major cultural change in cybersecurity, moving trust from human hands to automated systems. Tenable Chief Security Officer Robert Huber “For years, teams have been hesitant to automatically remediate, but I believe that to keep pace with the threat and expansion of the attack surface, teams will start to defy that long-held belief that automatic is forbidden,” he adds. Prediction: In 2026, teams will rethink the tenet that automatic remediation is too risky to implement, as manual remediation proves unsustainable for most organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve and manage their cyber risk effectively without overwhelming their security pros. 3 - Cloud security focus shifts from runtime detection to prevention-first strategies Is the industry finally moving past the idea that runtime detection is a silver bullet? We think so. Heading into 2026, security leaders are increasingly recognizing that many cloud breaches begin well before runtime, and will look to build a resilient defense via a broader, preemptive approach. “The 2025 hype that runtime detection is the only thing that matters and could replace posture or identity analysis will fade in 2026,” says Liat Hayun, Tenable Senior Vice President of Product Management and Research. Liat Hayun, Tenable Senior Vice President of Product Management and Research “Runtime-only tools miss most attack paths because identity abuse and misconfigurations occur long before anything reaches runtime. Runtime will remain important, but it won’t replace CNAPP or exposure management – it’ll be another data source inside a broader prevention-first approach,” she adds. Prediction: The narrative that runtime detection can supersede identity and posture analysis will rapidly lose steam in 2026. Instead, runtime tools will function as a complementary data input, reinforcing a security architecture that is anchored on a CNAPP and an exposure management platform and that preemptively identifies and mitigates risks . 4 - Acceleration becomes the single biggest threat to your organization Can your security team move faster than a lightning-quick AI-driven attack? In 2026, attack speed will become the greatest challenge for cyber defenders. As attackers leverage automation to compress the attack lifecycle, the window for effective response shrinks. “The who, what, how, and why of an attack don’t matter because AI-fueled attacks start and end before a ticket is even created,” Doerr says. That’s why organizations must make it a priority to quickly set up preemptive security programs. Otherwise, they leave themselves exposed to cyber risks that traditional, reactive methods simply can’t mitigate. “Proactive defense makes speed obsolete,” he says. Prediction: In 2026, AI-fueled acceleration will become adversaries’ primary weapon, rendering reactive security measures ineffective. In response, cyber teams must shift to proactive cyber prevention , which eliminates exposures before they can be exploited, neutralizing the speed advantage that AI provides to cyber criminals. 5 - CISOs will embrace AI security tools built in-house As we move past the novelty phase of generative AI, 2026 will mark a shift toward the utility of agentic AI, and with it a growing appreciation for custom-made AI security tools tailored for an organization’s specific needs. Complementing off-the-shelf AI products with tools built in-house will allow for more precise, effective security workflows and processes that can lessen the burden on overworked cyber pros. “When implemented and designed with care, custom-made AI tools will transform security operations and alleviate pain points that lead to burnout,” Huber says. Prediction: In 2026, rather than relying solely on commercial AI security tools, CISOs will direct their teams to build their own AI wares tailored to their organization's unique challenges. These customized AI tools will, in turn, sharpen their cybersecurity programs and lighten the workload on their staff. 6 - Non-human identities will become the top cloud breach vector Machine identities now outnumber human users by many orders of magnitude. This explosion of non-human identities (NHIs) is creating a massive, stealthy attack surface. In 2026, these billions of service accounts, keys, and tokens are set to become the primary vector for cloud breaches. “The core problem is no longer misconfigs or missing patches. It’ll be billions of unseen, over-permissioned machine identities that attackers – or autonomous agentic AI – will leverage for silent, undetectable lateral movement,” Hayun says. “CISOs will be forced to pivot massive spending toward permissions governance and large-scale cleanup as machine-identity sprawl has rendered cloud environments truly unmanageable,” she adds. Prediction: NHIs will decisively become the number one cloud breach vector in 2026, a trend driven by myriad machine identities with excessive privileges. As a result, CISOs will need to prioritize getting this vast landscape of machine identities under control by strengthening identity and access management (IAM) governance and execution.",

They will be sentenced on March 12, 2026, the US Department of Justice announced this week. Ryan Goldberg and Kevin Martin were charged with using the BlackCat ransomware against multiple victims in the US between April 2023 and December 2023. An unnamed co-consiprator was also listed in the court filings . They were accused of targeting five companies with the ransomware: a Florida medical device company, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office in California, an engineering company in California, and a drone manufacturer in Virginia. BlackCat ransomware, also known as ALPHV, is particularly pernicious as it can exploit cloud copies of data intended to protect against ransomware attacks as a way into the enterprise. Those behind it are among the most dangerous ransomware groups active today . Goldberg and Martin didn’t develop BlackCat, though: they identified victims and targeted them with the ransomware-as-a-service , sharing ransom payouts with the developers. The two reached plea agreements with the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida on Dec. 18, 2025, and these were accepted by the US District Court for the Southern District fo Florida on Dec. 29, court records show. The ransomware attacks resulted in losses exceeding $9.5 million, the parties agreed. However, authorities were only able to trace $324,123.26 in proceeds of the crimes to Goldberg and Martin, according to the plea agreements. The pair face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. US authorities have been after them and the developers of the BlackCat software they used for years. The wider ransomware group is believed to have targeted more than 1,000 victims around the world, according to a DOJ news release . The group was defanged in December 2023, when the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) developed a tool that could decrypt data held to ransom, according ot the DOJ. It estimated this saved hundreds of victims some $99 million in ransomware payments.",

Miguel De Bruycker, director of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB), told the Financial Times that it was “currently impossible” to store data fully in Europe because US companies dominate digital infrastructure. “We’ve lost the whole cloud. We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.” The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said. [...] Europe needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation. He suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies. It could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on [an] EU level in the cyber domain.” submitted by /u/vanderbeeken [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "Hi all, I have recently joined a company that is past the maturity mark of a startup but still an early stage company. I am in a multiple-hat security role as you can expect with it being a startup. It’s in a heavily regulated industry and pretty much everything is SaaS where possible. There is minimal infrastructure fully under our control. Since this startup is already relatively mature in the security sense (MFA, CA policies, SSO where possible, Vuln scanning, Code scanning etc.), I’m finding it difficult to know what to focus on next, what to implement, what to review, or where I can add value, especially after having already reviewed most of the existing configuration and setup. It feels like there’s simply less (almost no) active security work to be doing, and I feel unproductive because of it. My previous company was a much more mature ~10k user hybrid environment where there was always work to be done, big improvement projects, more incidents etc. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do, what are your thoughts etc? I’m going to upskill with some training in the meantime. I should also mention this job is a significant salary and benefit increase which is why I’d like to improve my situation here rather than immediately look elsewhere. submitted by /u/not-fungible [link] [comments]",

    "title": "CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Surged 20% in 2025",
    "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added 245 vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog in 2025, as the database grew to 1,484 software and hardware flaws at high risk of cyberattacks. The agency removed at least one vulnerability from the catalog in 2025 – CVE-2025-6264, a Velociraptor Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability that CISA determined had insufficient evidence of exploitation – but the database has generally grown steadily since its launch in November 2021. After an initial surge of added vulnerabilities after the database first launched, growth stabilized in 2023 and 2024, with 187 vulnerabilities added in 2023 and 185 in 2024 . Growth accelerated in 2025, however, as CISA added 245 vulnerabilities to the KEV catalog , an increase of more than 30% above the trend seen in 2023 and 2024. With new vulnerabilities surging in recent weeks, the elevated exploitation trend may well continue into 2026. Overall, CISA KEV vulnerabilities grew from 1,239 vulnerabilities at the end of 2024 to 1,484 at the end of 2025, an increase of just under 20%. We’ll look at some of the trends and vulnerabilities from 2025 – including 24 vulnerabilities known to be exploited by ransomware groups – along with the vendors and projects that had the most CVEs added to the list this year. Older Vulnerabilities Added to CISA KEV Also Grew The addition of older vulnerabilities to the CISA KEV catalog also grew in 2025. In 2023 and 2024, 60 to 70 older vulnerabilities were added to the KEV catalog each year. In 2025, the number of vulnerabilities from 2024 and earlier added to the catalog grew to 94, a 34% increase from a year earlier. The oldest vulnerability added to the KEV catalog in 2025 was CVE-2007-0671, a Microsoft Office Excel Remote Code Execution vulnerability. The oldest vulnerability in the catalog remains one from 2002 – CVE-2002-0367, a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows NT and Windows 2000 smss.exe debugging subsystem that has been known to be used in ransomware attacks. Vulnerabilities Used in Ransomware Attacks CISA marked 24 of the vulnerabilities added in 2025 as known to be exploited by ransomware groups. They include some well-known flaws such as CVE-2025-5777 (dubbed “CitrixBleed 2”) and Oracle E-Business Suite vulnerabilities exploited by the CL0P ransomware group. The full list of vulnerabilities newly exploited by ransomware groups in 2025 is included below, and should be prioritized by security teams if they’re not yet patched. Vulnerabilities Exploited by Ransomware Groups CVE-2025-5777 Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway Out-of-Bounds Read CVE-2025-31161 CrushFTP Authentication Bypass CVE-2019-6693 Fortinet FortiOS Use of Hard-Coded Credentials CVE-2025-24472 Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Authentication Bypass CVE-2024-55591 Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Authentication Bypass CVE-2025-10035 Fortra GoAnywhere MFT Deserialization of Untrusted Data CVE-2025-22457 Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways Stack-Based Buffer Overflow CVE-2025-0282 Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways Stack-Based Buffer Overflow CVE-2025-55182 Meta React Server Components Remote Code Execution CVE-2025-49704 Microsoft SharePoint Code Injection CVE-2025-49706 Microsoft SharePoint Improper Authentication CVE-2025-53770 Microsoft SharePoint Deserialization of Untrusted Data CVE-2025-29824 Microsoft Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver Use-After-Free CVE-2025-26633 Microsoft Windows Management Console (MMC) Improper Neutralization CVE-2018-8639 Microsoft Windows Win32k Improper Resource Shutdown or Release CVE-2024-55550 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal CVE-2024-41713 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal CVE-2025-61884 Oracle E-Business Suite Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) CVE-2025-61882 Oracle E-Business Suite Unspecified CVE-2023-48365 Qlik Sense HTTP Tunneling CVE-2025-31324 SAP NetWeaver Unrestricted File Upload CVE-2024-57727 SimpleHelp Path Traversal CVE-2024-53704 SonicWall SonicOS SSLVPN Improper Authentication CVE-2025-23006 SonicWall SMA1000 Appliances Deserialization Projects and Vendors with the Highest Number of Exploited Vulnerabilities Microsoft once again led all vendors and projects in CISA KEV additions, with 39 vulnerabilities added to the database in 2025, up from 36 in 2024. Several vendors and projects had fewer vulnerabilities added in 2025 than they did in 2024, suggesting improved security controls. Among the vendors and projects that saw a decline in KEV vulnerabilities in 2025 were Adobe, Android, Apache, Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware. 11 vendors and projects had five or more KEV vulnerabilities added this year, included below. Vendor/project CISA KEV additions in 2025 Microsoft 39 Apple 9 Cisco 8 Fortinet 8 Google Chromium 7 Ivanti 7 Linux Kernel 7 Citrix 5 D-Link 5 Oracle 5 SonicWall 5 Most Common Software Weaknesses Exploited in 2025 Eight software and hardware weaknesses (common weakness enumerations, or CWEs) were particularly prominent among the 2025 KEV additions. The list is similar to last year , although CWE-787, CWE-79, and CWE-94 are new to the list this year. CWE-78 – Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’) – was again the most common weakness among vulnerabilities added to the KEV database, accounting for 18 of the 245 vulnerabilities added in 2025. CWE-502 – Deserialization of Untrusted Data – again came in second, occurring in 14 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-22 – Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory, or ‘Path Traversal’ – moved up to third place with 13 appearances. CWE-416 – Use After Free – slipped a spot to fourth and was behind 11 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-787 – Out-of-bounds Write – was a factor in 10 of the vulnerabilities. CWE-79 – Cross-site Scripting – appeared 7 times. CWE-94 (Code Injection) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) occurred 6 times each. Conclusion CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog remains a valuable tool for helping IT security teams prioritize patching and vulnerability management efforts. The CISA KEV catalog can also alert organizations to third-party risks – although by the time a vulnerability gets added to the database, it’s become an urgent problem requiring immediate attention. Third-party risk management (TPRM) solutions could provide earlier warnings about partner risk through audits and other tools. Finally, software and application development teams should monitor CISA KEV additions to gain awareness of common software weaknesses that threat actors routinely target.

I lost my mobile phone and immediately did everything by the book: Filed a complain Police Station, Jamshedpur Blocked the phone using CEIR (DoT portal) A few days later, I received an official SMS from the Department of Telecom stating that my blocked IMEI was attempted to be used , and that the information was shared with the same police station where my FIR was registered. After receiving this alert, I went multiple times to police stationHowever: The police told me they need location details from Cyber Cell They called Cyber Cell in front of me and then said “we can’t help” Police said only Cyber Cell can recover the phone I then personally contacted the Cyber Cell , and they told me something very important: Every police station is already provided CEIR login ID/password Police can directly check IMEI status and usage on CEIR Cyber Cell does not recover phones physically Cyber Cell also cannot share IMEI location directly with citizens Despite this, when I went back to the police station and told them what Cyber Cell said, the officers replied that no one in their station knows how to use CEIR , and again refused to proceed. So currently: CEIR says phone was active Cyber Cell says police already have access Police station says they can’t help and are waiting for Cyber Cell I feel like responsibility is being passed around, and my case is going nowhere even after official DoT confirmation. My questions: Is it normal for police stations to not use CEIR despite having access? What is the correct escalation route in such cases (SSP/DSP/online grievance)? Has anyone here successfully recovered a phone after a CEIR “attempted usage” alert? Any advice from lawyers, police officers, or people with similar experiences would be really helpful.

Unlike many modern ransomware groups, HardBit does not rely on data leak sites. Instead, it focuses on aggressive system control, credential theft, and destructive encryption. The latest version uses the Neshta file infector as a dropper, applies strong obfuscation, and requires operator-provided authorization keys to execute, significantly complicating analysis. Key Traits • uses the Neshta file infector as a ransomware dropper • deploys both CLI and GUI variants for operator flexibility • requires a runtime authorization ID and encryption key to execute • includes an optional Wiper mode for permanent data destruction • spreads laterally through RDP using harvested credentials • executes Mimikatz via batch scripts to dump credentials • scans networks using KPortScan and Advanced Port Scanner • disables Windows Defender through registry and PowerShell changes • deletes shadow copies and recovery options to prevent restoration • stops backup and security services before encryption HardBit 4.0 stands out for its use of legacy file infection techniques combined with modern ransomware controls and optional data wiping. Its authorization based execution and destructive mode make it especially dangerous in hands on keyboard intrusions.

    "title": "Cybersecurity skills matter more than headcount in the AI era",
    "summary": "Cybersecurity teams are navigating a shift as skills shortages overtake headcount as the primary concern, according to ISC2’s 2025 Cybersecurity Workforce Study . The research, based on responses from some 16,029 cybersecurity professionals globally, reveals that while budget cuts and layoffs have leveled off after last year’s surge, the pressure on security teams has intensified. ISC2, a nonprofit member organization for cybersecurity professionals , found that cybersecurity workforce budget limitations remain a key driver of staff shortages, with 33% of respondents stating that their organizations do not have enough resources to “adequately” staff their teams. Another 29% of respondents said they cannot afford to hire staff with the skills they need to “adequately secure their organizations,” this year’s study found. And nearly three-fourths (72%) of respondents said that they believe reducing security personnel “significantly increases the risk of a breach in their organizations,” according to ISC2. Economic conditions affecting cybersecurity budgets showed signs of stabilizing in 2025, according to ISC2, with reports of budget cuts dropping to 36% (down one percentage point from 2024) and layoffs declining to 24% (also down one point). Still, underlying workforce challenges remain. “Based on what we’re seeing in the data and the sentiment of cybersecurity professionals globally, there is no indication that budget cuts or layoffs will accelerate significantly in 2026,” says Casey Marks, Chief Operating Officer at ISC2. “Economic conditions will always play an important role in workforce development and enablement. However, the overall outlook does not suggest a worsening trend in 2026.” Skills gaps drive security consequences The study highlights a critical trend: Nearly 90% of respondents (88%) have experienced at least one significant cybersecurity event in their organizations due to skills shortages, with 69% reporting more than one event. The severity of skills needs has grown substantially, with 95% of respondents reporting at least one skill need (up 5% from 2024) and 59% citing critical or significant skills gaps (a 15% increase from the previous year). “A shift is happening. This year’s data makes it clear that the most pressing concern for cybersecurity teams isn’t headcount but skills,” said Debra Taylor, ISC2 Acting CEO and CFO, in a statement . “Skills deficits raise cybersecurity risk levels and challenge business resilience.” Organizations have experienced oversights in cybersecurity processes and procedures (26%), been forced to put underqualified or inexperienced people into roles to cover them (25%), are lacking the time or resources to train cybersecurity staff (25%), and are dealing with misconfigured systems (24%), according to this year’s study. The report also states “Another commonly cited (24%) outcome of skills shortages is that parts of the organization are left under-secured and staff are unable to take advantage of emerging cybersecurity technologies (24% each),” the report states. While the study doesn’t tie security consequences to specific technical domains, the number of consequences shows how capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount, Marks says. “AI and cloud security continue to stand out as the most urgent skills needs from both hiring managers and cybersecurity professionals. Nearly everyone in the study reports at least one skills need, and most report significant ones,” Marks says. “That tells us capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount.” AI adoption accelerates The research found that AI adoption is accelerating quickly, with 28% of respondents reporting that they have already integrated AI tools into their operations and 69% involved in some level of adoption, through integration, active testing, or early evaluation. “What stands out is how fast AI has moved from experimentation into day-to-day operations. More than two-thirds of respondents are already using, testing, or actively evaluating AI tools in their security programs,” Marks explains. “For those who are using them today, the majority are already seeing measurable productivity gains. That tells us that AI is quickly becoming a practice part of how security work gets done, not a future concept.” The study shows that cybersecurity professionals view AI technology as a career accelerator. The study found that 73% believe AI will create more specialized cybersecurity skills, 72% say it will necessitate more strategic cybersecurity mindsets, and 66% said they believe it will require broader skillsets across the workforce. AI remains one of the top skills needed for the second consecutive year, with 41% of respondents of the 2025 study citing it as a critical skill, followed by cloud security at 36%. According to the report, 48% of respondents are already working to gain generalized AI knowledge and skills, while “35% are educating themselves on AI solutions at risk to better understand vulnerabilities and exploits.” “The use of AI tools and the perception that AI will be a career-booster in the cybersecurity industry are prompting professionals to take proactive steps to develop and expand their knowledge and skill base to future-proof their careers,” Marks says. “They see it as a driver of new and more specialized skills, more strategic responsibilities, and broader career pathways.” High cybersecurity job satisfaction The research found that 87% believe there will always be a need for cybersecurity professionals , 81% are confident the profession will remain strong, and 68% are satisfied in their current job (up two percentage points from 2024). Another 80% report feeling passionate about their work. “While satisfaction with organizations and leadership varies, confidence in the profession itself remains high, and that sense of purpose is a powerful stabilizing force. Cybersecurity is a mission-driven field, and 80% reported feeling passionate about their work, while 71% are satisfied with their day-to-day experience. A large majority believe the profession will remain essential in the long term and will continue to feel passionate about their role,” Marks says. Almost half (48%) of respondents feel exhausted from trying to stay current on the latest cybersecurity threats and emerging technologies, and 47% feel overwhelmed by workload, according to the study. ISC2’s findings suggest that sustained investment in skills development—especially related to AI —realistic workload expectations, and support for continuous learning during working hours are essential. The study also found that career development is important to cybersecurity professionals. Nearly one-third (31%) of respondents said they consider advancement opportunities critical, and 23% cited unplanned financial or benefit rewards as key drivers. According to the 2025 study, 75% are likely to stay at their current organization for the next year, but that number drops to 66% when considering the next two years. The study’s findings proves that organizations must rethink their approach to cybersecurity workforce development , according to ISC2’s Marks. “The data shows tremendous energy at the individual level around AI upskilling. Nearly half of respondents are already building AI skills on their own, and many plan to pursue AI-focused qualifications,” Marks says. “Organizations are investing in development through training budgets, internal education and cross-training, but the scale of demand for AI skills is significant. Our research shows widespread individual and organizational investment in AI upskilling, with demand continuing to grow.”",

PeopleImages.com – Shutterstock.com Generative KI (GenAI) ist zu einem allgegenwärtigen Werkzeug in Unternehmen geworden. Laut einer Umfrage der Boston Consulting Group nutzen 50 Prozent der Unternehmen die Technologie, um Arbeitsabläufe neu zu gestalten. 77 Prozent der Befragten sind überzeugt, dass KI-Agenten in den nächsten drei bis fünf Jahren eine zentrale Rolle für ihre Unternehmensfunktionen spielen werden. CISOs und ihre Sicherheitsteams sind mit der Leistungsfähigkeit künstlicher Intelligenz bestens vertraut und von den Fortschritten der KI ebenso betroffen wie alle anderen Funktionen im Unternehmen. Während Machine Learning seit Jahren ein wichtiger Bestandteil von Cyber-Operationen ist, führt der jüngste Fortschritt der KI – insbesondere im Bereich der generativen KI – dazu, dass sich die Technologie immer tiefer in die Sicherheitsprozesse vordringt. Diese Tools, teils selbst entwickelt, teils von Anbietern bereitgestellt, unterstützen unter anderem bei der Forensik, Incident Response, Log-Analyse, Orchestrierung, Schwachstellenmanagement und der Erstellung von Berichten. Der zunehmende Einsatz von KI in Sicherheitsprozessen verändert CyberOps grundlegend. Er steigert die Wirksamkeit und Produktivität von Sicherheitsexperten und verändert nachhaltig, wie Cybersicherheitsarbeit geleistet wird. „Es ist nicht das Was von CyberOps, das KI verändert, sondern das Wie . Sie verändert die Geschwindigkeit, mit der wir bestimmte Vorgänge erledigen können, und ermöglicht es Menschen, sich auf anspruchsvollere Tätigkeiten zu konzentrieren“, erklärt Matt Gorham , Leiter des Cyber & Risk Innovation Institute bei PwC. Kompetenzen erweitern, Aufgaben automatisieren „Da KI Aufgaben mit einer Geschwindigkeit ausführen kann, die menschliche Fähigkeiten übersteigt, skaliert sie das Arbeitsvolumen einer Cybersicherheitsfunktion exponentiell“, betont Rob T. Lee , Chief of Research für KI und neue Bedrohungen sowie Leiter der Fakultät am SANS Institute. Darüber hinaus sei KI besonders gut darin, repetitive Aufgaben jedes Mal nahezu perfekt auszuführen, heben Experten hervor. Damit liefere sie eine Konsistenz, die menschlichen Mitarbeitern kaum erreichen können. „Wenn jemand aus irgendeinem Grund nicht in Bestform ist, können die Ergebnisse variieren“, erklärt Dan Mellen , globaler Cyber-CTO bei EY. KI hingegen verfolgt einen deterministischen Ansatz und erledigt dieselbe Aufgabe immer auf die gleiche Weise.“ Dadurch sei die Konsistenz der Ergebnisse deutlich höher und vorhersehbarer ist als bei Menschen, so Mellen. KI könne jedoch nicht nur die Geschwindigkeit und die Skalierbarkeit des Sicherheitsteams steigern, sondern auch das Kompetenzniveau erhöhen, argumentiert Jeffrey Brown , Dozent bei IANS Research, Cybersicherheitsberater für Finanzdienstleistungen bei Microsoft und ehemaliger CISO des Bundesstaates Connecticut. „KI ist ein Kraftmultiplikator für die Verteidigung, und zwar gleich in zweierlei Hinsicht“, erklärt Brown: „Die Technologie hebt das Wissensniveau von Junior-Mitarbeiter deutlich an und hilft ihnen, sich schneller einzuarbeiten. Gleichzeitig macht sie erfahrene Mitarbeiter effektiver und definiert Produktivität auf höherem Niveau neu.“ Als Beispiel verweist der Cybersecurity-Experte auf den Einsatz von KI in einem Security Operations Center (SOC). Dort könne KI einen erheblichen Teil – und in einigen Fällen sogar alle – Level-1-Support-Aufgaben übernehmen, etwa Ticket-Triage und -Routing. Damit würden SOC-Mitarbeiter entlastet und könnten sich um komplexere Level-2- oder-3-Probleme kümmern. Generative KI könne den SOC-Mitarbeitern zudem automatisierte Fallstudien und Handlungsempfehlungen für anspruchsvollere Aufgaben liefern und so Effizienz und Produktivität steigern. Trotz der Befürchtungen, dass durch KI Arbeitsplätze verloren gehen könnten, hat Brown bisher beobachtet, dass CISOs KI nicht zum Ersatz von Mitarbeitern, sondern zur Verbesserung ihrer Arbeit einsetzen. „KI ist am effektivsten, wenn weiterhin ein Mensch im Loop bleibt“, erklärt er. Auf diese Weise erweitere KI den Handlungsspielraum von CISO-Teams und befähige mehr Teammitglieder, anspruchsvollere Aufgaben zu übernehmen. So habe etwa der Einsatz von KI im Threat Modelling es Unternehmen mit kleineren, weniger spezialisierten Teams ermöglicht, potenzielle Sicherheitsbedrohungen proaktiv zu identifizieren, zu analysieren und zu entschärfen – Aufgaben, die sie vor der Einführung von KI nicht bewältigen konnten. „Im Allgemeinen beobachten wir, dass SecOps-Teams mit den vorhandenen Ressourcen mehr leisten und das Qualifikationsniveau insgesamt steigt. Ihre Arbeit verschiebt sich spürbar nach oben“, erklärt Wolfgang Goerlich , Dozent bei IANS Research und CISO im öffentlichen Sektor. Kleinere Teams, neues Qualifikationsparadigma All dies wirkt ich auch auf die Personalstrategie aus. Sicherheitsexperten gehen davon aus, dass traditionelle Einstiegspositionen im IT-Security-Bereich bald verschwinden werden. Berufseinsteiger müssten bereit sein, auf einer höheren Ebene einzusteigen. Dies gelte insbesondere, da agentenbasierte KI immer ausgereifter werde, in immer mehr Sicherheitsabteilungen zum Einsatz komme und einen zunehmend größeren Teil der Aufgaben übernehme, so Brown. „Wir müssen uns überlegen, wie viele und welche Arten von Experten wir benötigen“, fügt er hinzu. Als Brown CISO für den Bundesstaat Connecticut war, hatte er beispielsweise einen Mitarbeiter in seinem Sicherheitsteam, der sich auf Phishing konzentrierte. Heute stellt er in Frage, ob es eine solche Spezialisierung noch braucht, wenn Agentic AI automatisch große Teile oder sogar den gesamten Workflow zur Reaktion auf Phishing-Angriffe übernehmen kann. Mit KI werden Cybersicherheitsteams nach Einschätzung von Brown mit KI kleiner – und bestehen aus weniger klassischer Spezialisten. „Stattdessen werden sie zu Managern von Agenten, die ihnen bei der Arbeit helfen“, sagt er. Brown räumt jedoch ein, dass der Einsatz von KI in CyberOps neue Kompetenzen erfordern wird – und dass CISOs gezielt nach diesen Fähigkeiten suchen müssen. Kenntnisse in KI-Governance, Prompt Engineering und Data Science werden seiner Ansicht nach auf allen Ebenen der IT-Sicherheit unverzichtbar. „Das ist ein gewaltiger Paradigmenwechsel“, erklärt er. „Wir brauchen Menschen, die sich mit Agenten auskennen, und erkennen können, ob dieser die richtige Antwort gibt – oder nicht.“ „Menschliche Intuition ist unersetzlich“, so Brown abschließend. „Es wird eher eine Symbiose zwischen Mensch und KI sein, eine Partnerschaft, bei der KI die Produktivität steigert, aber immer mit einem Menschen im Loop.“ Der Bedarf an Governance, Agilität und Geschwindigkeit Die beschleunigte Nutzung von KI im gesamten Unternehmen verändert auch die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen. Die Cybersicherheit muss mit der Absicherung von KI und den von ihr verwendeten Daten überall dort Schritt halten, wo KI eingesetzt wird. Damit tun sich Security-Teams bereits heute schwer. Laut dem Bericht „ State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2025 “ von Accenture „hinken besorgniserregende 77 Prozent der Unternehmen bei der Einführung wesentlicher Sicherheitsmaßnahmen für Daten und KI hinterher. Nur 22 Prozent haben klare Richtlinien und Schulungen für den Einsatz von GenAI implementiert, und nur wenige führen ein vollständiges Inventar ihrer KI-Systeme – eine wichtige Voraussetzung, um das Risiko in der Lieferkette zu managen. Darüber hinaus ist der Datenschutz nach wie vor unzureichend – nur 25 Prozent der Unternehmen nutzen Verschlüsselung und Zugriffskontrollen konsequent, um sensible Informationen während der Übertragung, im Ruhezustand und bei der Verarbeitung zu schützen.“ Zudem stellt der Bericht fest, dass sich die Sicherheitslücken auch auf die Cloud-Infrastruktur erstrecken. Denn, so Accenture: „Trotz der Abhängigkeit der KI von Cloud-basierter Verarbeitung haben 83 Prozent der Unternehmen keine sichere Cloud-Basis mit integrierten Überwachungs-, Erkennungs- und Reaktionsfunktionen geschaffen.“ In ähnlicher Weise schreibt Gartner in seinem Bericht „ A CISO’s Guide to AI Cyber Stewardship “ vom Juli 2025, dass „CISOs bei der Sicherung der KI im gesamten Unternehmen hinterherhinken“. Um KI-bezogene Cyberrisiken zu managen, rät der Report CISOs, „einen Ansatz für die KI-Cyber-Stewardship zu verfolgen, der auf Kompetenz, Governance über den gesamten Lebenszyklus, interdisziplinären Schnittstellen, menschlicher Aufsicht, Basiskontrollen und AI TRiSM [Trust, Risk and Security Management] basiert.“ Sicherheitsverantwortliche sind sich einig, dass CyberOps seine KI-Governance-Funktion ausbauen muss – ebenso wie die Fähigkeit, KI-Agenten zu integrieren, zu identifizieren und zu autorisieren. „Es muss Kontrollmechanismen geben, um sicherzustellen, dass KI-Agenten nicht ihre Befugnisse überschreiten, genauso wie wir es bei Menschen handhaben“, erklärt Mellen. Zugleich muss die IT-Sicherheit schneller werden, wenn es darum geht, KI im Unternehmen abzusichern. „Das Tempo des geschäftlichen Wandels wird weiter steigen, und der CISO muss Schritt halten“, konstatiert Gorham. „Die dafür erforderlichen Fähigkeiten werden sich verändern; Cybersecurity-Teams brauchen neben den traditionellen Sicherheitskompetenzen eine Kombination aus KI-Fähigkeiten wie Prompt Engineering und Data-Science-Know-how.“ Cyber-Teams neu denken Avivah Litan , Distinguished VP Analyst bei Gartner, geht davon aus, dass KI mindestens ebenso viele Arbeitsplätze schaffen wird, wie sie ersetzt. Wie viele andere glaubt sie, dass KI „Menschen dazu befähigen wird, mehr und bessere Arbeit zu leisten“. Diese neuen CyberOps-Rollen werden ihrer Einschätzung nach notwendig sein, da Hacker KI nutzen, um immer raffiniertere Angriffe zu starten. „KI wird es Unternehmen ermöglichen, dem wirksamer zu begegnen“, fügt sie hinzu. All dies erfordert jedoch, dass CISOs ihre Security-Organisationen überdenken, um sicherzustellen, dass sie sowohl KI als auch Menschen optimal einsetzen. „Sie müssen sich fragen: ‚Wo ist es sinnvoll, einen Menschen einzusetzen, und was kann ich an die KI auslagern? Und welche Kosten entstehen dadurch, weil mir bestimmte Ressourcen im Team fehlen?‘“, erklärt CISO Goerlich. „Wir sind im Security-Bereich seit langem unterbesetzt, und darin liegt eine große Chance. Andererseits möchte niemand ein SOC-Team, das nur noch auf Knöpfe klickt.“ Goerlich zufolge müssen CISOs ihre Talentstrategien aktualisieren und Roadmaps entwickeln – um bestehender Mitarbeiter weiterzuentwickeln und neue Mitarbeiter für die Positionen der Zukunft einzustellen, in denen sie Seite an Seite mit KI und KI-Agenten arbeiten werden. Dabei darf jedoch die menschliche Intelligenz in den Sicherheitsprozessen nicht verloren gehen. Dies ist besonders wichtig, da – wie CISOs wissen – auch die Angreifer KI einsetzen. Und sie tun dies oft schneller, da sie anders als die Unternehmen nicht an ethische Vorgaben und rechtliche Vorschriften gebunden sind. Goerlich bemerkt dazu: „Die Zukunft der Security Operations wird ein Wettstreit zwischen KI und KI sein. Maschine gegen Maschine – mit Menschen im Cockpit, die auf der Verteidigerseite sicherstellen, dass die richtigen Dinge geschehen – oder auf der Seite der Angreifer dafür sorgen, dass die Attacken erfolgreich sind. Das wird uns zwingen, unsere Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu überdenken.“ (mb)",

This year was particularly challenging for many reasons and one of the primary ones was the continuing saga of our antique house. For all the people who haven’t purchased a house yet but want to, you might want to read this first. This image was generated by Nano Banana. It got a decent Savannah porch in there but the roof doesn’t look exactly right and the paint looks fuzzy instead of like it’s peeling. You can usually still tell images are generated by AI if you look closely. Most of the marketing photos I see on cloud sites definitely look AI-generated. Still, probably close enough to give you an idea what I’m going to write about. :) This is going to be a pretty long brain dump because there are different considerations for different types of houses. In addition, all of this has been…a lot…Just kind of getting it all out there so anyone else buying a home or trying to fix one can learn from my mistakes and experiences. This also explains what my focus will be, in part, in 2026 and how that intersects with my technical research and goals. The lakeside condo I’m on my third house. The first one was a condo actually. I like this particular part of town in Seattle after I got out of school from the University of Washington in Seattle. I had rented a place in Wedgewood with my last college roommates (I had a wide variety over the years) up on a hill in a nice neighborhood north of school. That was an ok place to live but I found myself drawn to Magnuson Park on Lake Washington most of the time. I always want to live by water. I explored the places I could live right near that park and ran across these condominiums called “The Sand Piper.” I liked them the best of the ones I saw in that area. I noticed that there were advertisements on the window of the manager’s office where people were renting the condos out but I couldn’t afford them. I figured well if they can put up notices that they were renting maybe I could put up a little sign saying I wanted to rent one and how much I could pay. The manager was a nice old guy and said OK. Almost immediately after putting up my little sign I got a call. There was a man who had moved out of his condo to take care of his sick mother. We worked out an agreement and I rented his place. I lived there for a few years and then at some point, I contacted him and asked him if I could buy it. Amazingly he said OK and I bought it without a realtor for a pretty low price. I had a $450 per month payment and the stupidest thing I ever did was sell that condo. I needed the money to keep running my business. Never. Do. That. I thought I was going to move and rent temporarily and do the same thing to buy the next place. But it never worked out. The dot bomb crash hit and one thing after another went wrong and I ended up bouncing around for a bit. Transient home hopping I went to San Diego for a while to play beach volleyball, Australia (Manly Beach), Chicago for a couple of weeks to help a family member, stayed with my parents for a bit since I hadn’t seen them in a while, and then back to Seattle where I stayed with a friend for a couple of weeks and then found an apartment — on the water next to Alki Beach. I stayed in that apartment for a while and I love it. It was a building built in 1937 with historic windows and doors and features. It has the hugest big window. You just can’t find those things everywhere. I thought I’d probably never move. I thought that I should buy a house and have some equity but I loved my little apartment, the location, and everything about it. Alki Beach Bungalow But then my ex-business partner became a real estate agent and he asked me if I wanted to look at houses. I wanted to help him out so I said OK I’ll look — but don’t expect me to buy anything. I didn’t want him to get his hopes up. Literally on our first trip out, I walked into this little house with a view of Alki Beach that looked like nothing special in the listing. I walked in, walked up to the 1940’s solid wood window trim and put my hands on either side of looking at the water. “I want it!” The house was cheap by all standards due to the 2008 crash. The owners were elderly folks who had moved out and their kids were selling. The first deal had fallen through and they wanted to unload it. The house was just out of my price range based on the loan for which I was approved. I put in an offer for exactly the amount I had — and they accepted it! I must admit I got so lucky with that house. I think I bought at the very bottom of the market. I had a 2% interest loan. The guy that owned it was a Boeing engineer and he and his wife took care of it very well. It was a solid find with no major structural issues. By the time I left I think I fixed everything that was in my original inspection report. It was a cute 944 square foot (1440 with unfinished basement I loved) with a view and a pool. The house came with a pool. I grew up with a pool. I didn’t want a pool. They are a lot of work. But oh well maybe if I have a pool I will have a lot of people over for pool parties. I had a couple of parties but mostly the pool didn’t get a ton of use while I lived there. It was only really usable three months of the year and it was mostly an expensive hassle. Over the years I had the sewer line inspected and they blew fiberglass in it before I resurfaced the pool. That also fixed it so rats wouldn’t keep trying to get at it due to the leaks. I replaced an oil furnace with a heat pump. I refinished the kitchen, modified a closet to become a custom server and media cabinet closet, and put in a TV that came out of the ceiling in a very oddly configured living room. I redid the fireplace installing a wood-burning insert. I remodeled the kitchen including a custom cabinet. Remodeled the bathroom with a custom designed vanity and tile. Changed all the lights. And painted it many, many times because I loved changing the colors. OK so that house was pretty cool. So why did I move? Well after a while I just wanted to get out of Seattle for various reasons. It’s beautiful in some ways, in others not so much. I was looking around for where to move but in the end I didn’t know where to go so I just decided to stay. Then I started talking to my now husband. Long story short, I’m in Savannah and I love it. A Savannah Victorian Antique When I started looking at houses in Savannah, the only ones I truly liked were the historic houses. I LOVE historic houses. My house in Alki Beach was built in 1940’s which is not that old but for Seattle it’s older. At first I saw the old wood wall and thought — that has got to go. Then I read about the history of the wood walls and realized it wasn’t paneling. It was actually real wood. I left it. In that house I went for a mix of modern and historic but in Savannah I could get a truly antique house (over 100 years old). Those are few and far between in Seattle. In Savannah, there are still many 100+ year old houses. Savannah is a bit strange because you have a real mix of incomes and homes and city buildings all in the same neighborhood and sometimes on the same street or even block. It’s also expanding. The core historic homes go for millions of dollars in downtown Savannah. As you move outwards the homes become more run down in some areas and less historic in others. You can see how over the decades more and more homes were added, expanding the city outward. There are some neighborhoods with super nice homes outside of the historic district in Savannah in a particular area built in the 40’s and 50’s with somewhat questionable history. Well, really a lot of Savannah has such history. We were told that the condo kitty corner to us was a brothel, for instance. And this used to be one of the most dangerous parts of the city apparently. It’s changed over the years as with many neighborhoods — for better or for worse. When I moved here I could see the edge of the truly historic and the renovation moving outwards, north and south and west of the city. I found a location that was just on the edge of the “expensive” homes on the edge of a lot of construction and renovation and bought there. I looked at homes that had been renovated but I purposely found a historic home that had some issues so I could renovate it the way I wanted. The home I purchased has old fashioned wooden floors, brick chimneys, four fireplaces, a trunk room, a hallway that I presume used to be a butler’s pantry, huge pocket doors (I mean really huge), 12 foot ceilings, and truly historic windows (they still have ropes and chains, wavy glass , and historic wood and one huge bay window). The siding looks historic not like cement board and has the appropriate narrow sizing. I can always tell when windows and siding have been replaced with less historic materials. The columns are round, not just square beams added later after the original porch failed. But little did I know, the history and ability to renovate comes with a price. The luck I had with my first two homes did not transfer to this latest purchase. Yes, I read the inspection report. I knew it had some issues just like the other home I purchased. What I didn’t realize was the gravity of those issues and how they might impact the stability of home. Live and learn. I had to buy the house pretty fast because the market was so crazy. I did have an inspection and I did have a contractor come out and estimate the cost of replacing one failing beam. But what I didn’t realize was that one failing beam wasn’t the only or biggest problem. So the rest of this post is just a few tips on things I’ve learned — not only with this house but from all the places I have lived. HOA dues — know what you’re getting yourself into When you buy a home in some places — most condos, townhomes, gated communities and what are called “plantations” here in the south — come with HOA dues. HOA dues are for the homeowners association associated with the location and I’m not going to get into ALL the drama you can face being part of a location that has HOA dues. There are pros and cons to HOA dues. The pros — they take care of a lot of things for you like landscaping and some maintenance external to your property. The cons — you have to pay a monthly fee that may be raised or worse — something big fails on the property and everyone has to chip in to fix it whether you have the money or not and whether you agree with the change or not. You likely have a vote but if your vote is in the minority you may end up having to come up with thousands of dollars to pay for something you may or may not want. I was clueless and got really lucky when I bought my condo at the Sand Piper because the HOA dues were low and they had just fixed the roof. I’ve known people who had to pay for fixing roofs, windows, and even pay for renovations in a shared restaurant and community center on the property that they never use. The inspection report At my first home, I had my dad come and inspect it. He built his own home and is very knowledgeable. I added his approval as a contingency in my real estate agreement. He inspected the house and gave his thumbs up — and he was right. That home was really solid and very well maintained. Most of the things I improved upon at that home were cosmetic. Now let’s talk about my home in Savannah. Yes, I got the inspection report. Yes, I read it. Yes I knew there were issues. But how everything transpired was not aligned with my expectations — exacerbated by the rise of interest rates and hiring some contractors that made it worse by ripping my house apart so I could not refinance as the interest rates skyrocketed. Live and learn. I made a good amount of money when I sold my Seattle home. I actually bought a cheaper home in Savannah so I could use the extra money to fix it up. It’s amazing how fast that money evaporated. That’s what it feels like anyway. Taxes I had to pay more taxes than expected from the sale due to a mistake I made after moving. I should have stayed in Seattle and not changed my mailing address until the deal was complete. I had a Georgia address while transitioning and ended up having to pay Georgia state tax on my home sale even though I hadn’t officially become a Georgia resident yet! Interest rates and bank shenanigans I also didn’t secure a loan due to weird issues with the bank that financed the loan — and approved me and then UN-approved me when I had hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in the bank. To this day I am skeptical. I think someone at that bank may have wanted to buy my house because they saw it was a good deal. I ended up cashing out a bunch of stocks and paying in cash, but along with that came a big tax bill and no loan secured at a cheap interest rate. And about that good deal — I have issues to fix but the value of the house rose like $300K in two years so…am I right? Who knows if the market will hold but Savannah seems to be expanding in a good way, even if it has some problems. I am still happy with my purchase even in light of some of the issues I’m about to tell you about. Ok so now about that inspection report… Electric bills My house in Savannah is four times bigger than my house in Seattle. Holy electric bills. Savannah has some times where the weather is mild and we turn off the air conditioner and heating system, but in those summer months…phew. And there are about two months in the winter where it gets very cold, rainy and we had some unusually code freezes. Beyond that I learned that the back half of the house is missing a lot of insulation …and eventually I realized that the back of the house was literally peeling off the rest of the house due ot a failing foundation and maybe pressure from above. Hold that thought. We are literally heating and cooling the city of Savannah. I’m talking $600–700 per month in some cases. Insane! I ended up plugging a bunch of things as best I could and we put some stupid looking blankets up on the door to our pantry and laundry room — but there’s literally a gap above both those door frames where they are breaking away from the house and the air is seeping in. I don’t think that was in our inspection report. HVAC Ducts Our inspection report mentioned some issues with the ducts under the house. Maybe chewed up by animals. Ok. More on that later. What I learned was that those ducts may be contributing to the expense of heating and cooling the house. So of course I got those fixed almost right away. While I was at it I had them install a sump pump kind of thing to deal with water under the house. They told me there was some strange pipe going all the way from one side of the house to the other. There was no apparent reason at the time as I hadn’t lived in the house long enough to know why. It would be cheaper just to have the water leak out ot the closer side. Ok sure. But then I saw that the water was just draining out on the side of the house and not going anywhere. The HVAC guy shrugged. Not his thing. So what’s the point of a sump pump that drains to nowhere? That makes no sense. I had some challenges with the whole drainage problem so let’s talk about that. Water So much water. The first two times I came to Savannah it was sunny and nice — May and November. Then I came in December and I told my husband that I thought he had pulled one over on me. Rain in Georgia doesn’t play. When it rains, the sky opens up and the clouds dump over barrels of rain all at once. The thunder is earth shattering. The inspection report said there was some standing water under our house. Yeah yeah ok. No really, there ended up being a river flowing between our house and the neighbor’s house. Not only that the sewer line in front of our house had issues. I joked that when it rains we had lake front property. Hold that thought. Pondering the foundation OK so there’s some issues with the bricks in the pilings holding the house up in the inspection report. Ok sure. I know the floors aren’t level and seems like that all needs to be fixed at once. That’s logical right? I called Ram Jack and another similar company for a quote and they were either $17K or $45K. I had no idea it was going to be so much after the things I had fixed in Seattle. Then a structural engineer told me I probably didn’t need that. I could just put car jacks down there yada yada. The floors can be leveled from inside the house. Ok. (But how do you maintain the antique floor…? More on that in a minute.) The gist of it was that Ram Jack, that company that is always on TV might be overkill. I held off at that moment to explore other options. I hired a different structural engineer ( Brian Sapp ) because the first one disappeared and he gave me a second opinion on everything. He gave me some temporary fixes until we would were ready to do the big project. Would they last? Who knows. Only time would tell. I went seeking for someone to help me put in those temp fixes while we waited for interest rates to come down. The guest bathroom I hired a contractor and that’s a whole long story I won’t bore you with completely. I wanted him to finish this temp project and help come up with a plan for the larger project. After waiting for a year for him at the recommendation of some others he took over six months to complete a project that he suggested could be done in 3–4 weeks. One thing I wanted him to do was just replace some moldy walls in a bathroom temporarily because I had guests coming over. Instead his carpenter ripped out the whole bathroom wall! He also said he could not tell what to do with the back room until he ripped the ceiling off so I said go ahead. THEN. I find out that the bank won’t give us a loan while the house is “under construction.” Do you think a contractor should know this when he knows we are trying to refinance to get a loan to do the project? I don’t know. Seems odd. So I ask him if he can quickly put the house back together. I also am pondering if I should just fix the bathroom wall or the whole bathroom. He claims he can probably get the bathroom done in three weeks. Yeah. Six months later interest rates are up over 2% and I ended up hiring my own plumber, my own electrician, and asking him to not bring the drywall people back. I and my nephew finished the drywall (mostly me in the end and I’m not great) just to get it done before we had guests over for my husband’s birthday. I even had to trick my husband into helping me and he hates tools. He was screwing in the plate covering the bathroom fan at the last minute while I scrambled to complete everything else (I didn’t) when the first guests walked through the door. Phew. I ended up doing some things to make that bathroom historic like an antique chandelier I got off eBay, a historic table I got at a local antique shop, a historic looking sink and a poster of a Life magazine cover from 1922. Our house was built in 1920. Now, before I had the contractor fix the bathroom he swore that there would be no reason why we shouldn’t do that. The foundation was solid. They could fix the adjoining rooms from within those rooms, etc. OK sure. We’ll see. It’s probably the nicest room in our house right now. Just give me a plan, ok? I need a plan. After that I gave up on refinancing as I realized I had jumped on a good (not great) rate at just the right time and secured it. Since then, even though the rates have dropped like three times, they are barely lower than that rate if they are at all. Those rates are killing our finances. I spent thousands and thousands of dollars more on interest thanks to our house getting ripped apart and not being able to refinance right at that moment. Also not being able to secure the initial home loan which would have been at 3.5%. Great thanks. That and the cost of everything went up — building materials, groceries, and now with tariffs so much more is costing more than if we had been able to do the project immediately when I wanted to do it. I never should have waited for that original contractor. But I was new to the city and I know it’s a small town where everyone knows each other and I just wasn’t sure what to do. I wanted to be everybody’s friend but that cost us a lot of money. Initially while waiting on that contractor I was hoping he would help us come up with a plan for fixing the house. I contacted multiple architects and it was hard to find one. The first one wanted to project manage the whole project. I couldn’t find examples of his work anywhere and for whatever reason he would not give me a complete price, only a price for the “as-built.” I wasn’t even sure if he could do the entire plan based on what I could find and I didn’t want a project manager scheduling meetings with all these people who bill by the hour. I wasn’t ready to hire all those people. I just wanted drawings that showed what I wanted the house to look like and my plan for fixing some structural issues and THEN I would get the right contractor to implement the plan. Mind you, he was super nice and may have been awesome but I really needed to know a budget so I could ensure I had enough money in the bank to pay him. I have learned from past business problems not to start anything until the money is in the bank. And I didn’t want the project managed the way he was indicating. I didn’t need a project manager — though I’m sure he would be a great one if that’s what you need. My contractor recommended a couple of architects. They set up meetings with me but never gave me a contract or a price! Is everyone really just that busy or what is going on here? I heard that people sometimes just want the high end projects and so they disregard the smaller projects. So what’s the deal? We pay our bills just like anyone else. Give me a quote! Give me a contract! I can’t get any architect to give me a darn contract. Finally I found Josh Ward . He’s amazing. He immediately sent me a contract but said he could not start right away. No problem. I paid a small very reasonable deposit. I wasn’t in a hurry at that point. I was extremely overloaded with work last year. Finally I had a bit of time and we had the money in the bank to pay him and his time freed up we got started. He is amazing, super nice, and his drawings were perfectly what I wanted with just a few tweaks. After completing that plan I was planning to get a contractor to help me implement the solution (using the terminology from the technical world in which I exist.) But then all hell broke loose… The big crack We didn’t quite finish the architectural plan when suddenly I go into my husband’s “man cave” next to the bathroom where I’ve been using the bathtub and I’m like, “Did you want to tell me the crack in the wall had expanded and is now HUGE?!” I’m freaking out. My husband never lived in a house that needed extensive repairs or had been remodeled. Things related to the house don’t phase him that much and most of the home repairs and planning is on me, which I am fine with. But I didn’t realize what was happening in that room because I never go in there. I grew up in remodels. I know a lot of the pitfalls. While my dad was trying to fix a ceiling it fell on his head — and he’s pretty particular and careful about how he does things. (His parents spoke German if you know what I mean.) He ended up building a church and his own house. Along the way he pulled all the trim in a historic house in Yelm, Washington used for a church parsonage, numbered it, fixed the walls, and then put all the trim back exactly as it was before he started. For anyone who says they need to rip out trim, windows, and other historic features, I know the truth. Yes it costs more. Yes it’s a pain. But I know it can be done. And if you’re going to buy an antique, why not restore it and maintain the antique features? Otherwise, what’s the point? Go buy a new house if that’s what you really want. Oh and if you live in the historic district in Savannah you are forced to do that by regulation. I am not in that neighborhood but I still want to maintain the historic qualities of our home. So anyway back to our beloved crack. The back of the house was clearly remodeled. When we ripped off the ceiling and part of the walls in the back room we found newspapers from 2008. The back of the house…is shoddy to say the least. We found out from a neighbor that at some point that part of the house caught on fire which likely is what led to the less than ideal repairs. I’ve always planned to rip a lot of it off and redo it while maintaining any historic features. But we weren’t quite ready to start. Well, now was the time. I frantically told the architect we need to hold off for a minute (well more than a minute) and he agreed. I called the structural engineer again with the idea that I needed a plan that worked with our pretty much complete architecture but apparently we had a miscommunication. He gave me another report. I have never worked with a structural engineer before so apparently I don’t use the correct words or whatever to communicate what I need because I wanted a solution — not another report. But it all worked out in the end and Brian was great. Drainage I wasn’t sure what to do at that point but remember that river flowing beside and under our house? And the HVAC system that we changed to push the water out the other side? Well, I figured that water might be exacerbating the problem under that wall so I searched around trying to find someone to deal with our drainage problem. This is not as easy as it sounds. There are not a lot of companies that just do drainage. Luckily I got a recommendation for Drainage Experts in Savannah through a community group. That was a lucky break. Frank came over and gave me a quote and they put in a super extensive drainage system all around the outside of our house and underneath it. He did a VERY good job as far as I can tell. I also got my neighbor to chip in and fix his gutter pipes that were sending water under our house and exacerbating the problem. They put in a huge pump and now all the water flows out into the sewer instead of heading under our house and into our neighbor’s yard. Luckily it seems the city has fixed the sewer issues in front of our house. Cool. In addition to the drainage another company put in some gutters. They were very cost-effective and quick. Professional Grade Gutters . They helped us out more later with some of the other issues below. So now that the drainage issue is solved, we can continue with the architecture and plan right? Not so fast… More cracks One of the problems in our inspection report was that we have these cement blocks on the roof holding the deck up in the back. And the roof is not exactly the right angle. OK so? Well, those blocks are literally sitting ON THE ROOF. What I learned from Frank is that they should have beams from the deck post all the way down to the ground. Also under that weird new fangled roof is the failing beam — the one thing I thought I had to worry about in the house — that would cost $5–15K to fix according to the contractor. Yeah right. I had already called a roofing company to fix the leak above that beam and our first contractor put up supports under that beam according to what the structural engineer told me to do. Only they did not put the support beams in the right place on top of the piers under the house according to subsequent report from the structural engineer. * Sigh. * So my plan with the architecture is to move the deck to the edge of the house and have the beams go from the deck all the way to the ground and remove those stupid cement blocks. And somehow we’ll find a way to merge those two roofs and replace that beam. And as I’m dealing with the water and trying to come up with a plan — from someone, anyone — the bathroom tile in the upstairs bathroom where a tub sticks out of the side of the house starts cracking very fast all the way up the corner. It literally cracks and wakes me up at night. And another wall in the man cave is cracking floor to ceiling. And a kitchen wall seems like it’s getting crushed. And I swear a crack in the back room got bigger like the back of that room is cracking off. Oh yeah and a brown crack appeared in our kitchen ceiling. And a crack appeared end to end in a historic fireplace mantle which kills me. And there are brown spots in ceilings around chimneys which I’m told is called rust and may be due to leaks around them or water coming in through them. Everyone who has lived here a long time tell me all this happens in old houses and yes you should fix it but no it’s fine. It will just keep cracking. No big deal. You’ll know when it’s really a problem when the ceiling falls down or something like that. So then there’s a windstorm and a balcony falls off a historic mansion next to Forsyth park. NOPE. Not gonna wait for that to happen. Working on this NOW. A plan…anyone please…a plan ACK! So I need a contractor to give me a plan to fix all this but I know the first step is to fix the foundation. After doing a lot of research and through discussion with a relative I know there’s a way to slowly raise the house from underneath by adding jacks and slowly pushing up the house to adjust the floors without breaking things . The problem with the companies that come and jack up your house all at once is that they jack the house up really fast, break a bunch of things, and the floors still won’t be level because the because the historic wood may be permanently bowed. Multiple people told me that the solution is to fix the floors by rebuilding them on top of the existing foundation. Regardless of how you end up fixing the foundation, I don’t see how doing that alone is going to solve all the problems. It doesn’t make sense to me. But that seems like the obvious place to start. I’m wondering if someone can start the process of raising the house in various places to help solve the problems. So I am frantically trying to find a contractor or anyone to help us and I want to do that thing to raise the house and fix the various issues. I talked to many people again including a guy from one of those foundation companies that jacks the house up who tells me he smells mold in the cracking bathroom and I should cut a small hole in the wall. And Frank came over and suggested that maybe the floor wasn’t built well enough to hold up the tub jutting out the side of the house. But we can’t tell that until the tub is pulled out and floor is inspected. And here’s where it gets nerve wracking. What if something has to be fixed that affects the bathroom below — the bathroom I never intended to fix in the first place and which the other contractor assured me would not be affected by other repairs. We’ll see. Leaks, mold, roofs, and chimneys After all this, it seems like the bathroom floor might be the source of our big crack — not the foundation? Or both. I don’t know. But anyway I cut a hole in the bathroom and yes mold and water damage. And this moldy smell all started when we did the drainage project and put in the new gutters. I’ve had many people inspect and tell me there’s no problem with the drainage. The river beside our house is pretty much non-existent. Everyone tells me there’s no water under the house. It might be related to the gutters. I call the gutter company to come back and inspect to try to pinpoint the source of the moldy smell and water damage there and possibly in other parts of the house. And at that point the gutter person sends me a photo and he’s fixing leaks in a roof…OK cool. Now I know he can do more than gutters and they did a really good job last time. We’ll see what he says. I finally get a contractor who agrees to come out and help us come up with a plan — for $5K. I’m ok with that actually. He seemed like he would be really good. I really liked this contractor but he wants to work in a certain way and I’m not sure we can start that right away. But I still want the plan and the budget so I can figure out what to do. How can you decide what to do without knowing the plan and the cost? But before he got back to me I had also started talking to foundation companies and the gutter company that actually can perform other types of services besides gutters. The company name on the new quote comes from Greg Loper of Professional Grade Gutters. And it is NOT as cheap as I expected. But he has like 85 pages of things to fix including something our new contractor said might be very expensive (and still may be) — dealing with the leaky and possibly failing chimneys. They ended up figuring out that there were leaks around the bathroom (there are gables? or something related to a pitched roof over that part of the house that sticks out). In addition, the front porch roof has problems — the wood is rotting and in the end he said it was worse than he thought. I have plans for that roof anyway. We had the flashing and mortar on the chimney fixed, added more gutters, fixed a lot of little leaks all over the roof and holes allowing sideways rain to get into the house. They could have done more with the siding but we have plans to redo that part of the house so that is momentarily on hold. We were also supposed to get caps on the chimneys but he apparently forgot that detail. We paid the invoice anyway because I knew he’d get back to fix it eventually. Missing chimney caps was also on our inspection report, but I didn’t think much of it. But in hindsight, the birds in our chimney every spring were due to the missing chimney caps (something I had mentioned to Greg) and perhaps the rain in the chimney was contributing to the fact that our chimneys seem to be failing and perhaps causing mold and rust on ceilings. I’m not sure. We have a crack in the historic woodwork in one of our upstairs bedrooms which makes me very sad and was told that could be related to a failing chimney. But wait. There’s more! Back to the foundation Besides the typical Ram Jack solutions (they advertise all over on TV here) I found another foundation company that repairs the pilings and wood instead of putting in jacks. They work with a lot of historic houses and had good reviews for the most part. I got quotes from them and the jack company that gave me the $17K quote earlier. What I find odd is that same company came back with a $58K quote this time for the same house. What? The house has not changed that much. The only difference is that now we are working with a structural engineer. In the meantime, it turns out my possible new contractor knows the structural engineer and the architect. Awesome they all work together and they all recommend each other which is promising. But before I signed the paperwork to have him help me come up with a plan, Brian Sapp got back to me about the foundation plans I sent him and says that he can do a design and then the foundation companies will implement the foundation according to the plan and then he will inspect it. YES . That is what I want. A design. A plan. Someone to inspect it to make sure it is done right. That’s exactly what I want. One caveat with Brian Sapp’s design is that he says he can only design the fix for the house the way it is today with no consideration of the architectural plan or what will be in the future. It’s too complicated to do that all at once. For that reason, I hold off on hiring the new contractor until we can get this initial foundation work done. In addition, the contractor says we have to move out and there’s no way we can break up the project in any way shape or form. Hmm. I’m thinking about that. It sounds like monolithic software projects versus micro-services. But anyway, first things first. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We ended up hiring Evolution in Action to come in an repair pilings, piers and beams under the house. They seemed like they had the specific experience we needed for a historic house and a lot of good reviews. We got a quote and it was reasonable for the work that needed to be done. Brian Sapp’s company came up with a design. Once they completed the design we met with him and Henry at Evolution in Action and went over the plan. Then when Evolution in Action was available they got started and finished the project in a very short amount of time, all things considered. Of course there were complications along the way due to a house that is over a century old with many “revisions” along the way. But in the end I feel relieved that part of the project is complete. I can’t see everything under the house but I trust that Brian’s crew inspected it appropriately and besides that Henry’s crew seemed to know what they were doing. What I can see looks very good. The leaning piers under our laundry room are now nice and straight. The floors are still crooked but that was part of the plan. The problem is that if you just start jacking up a house and try to level the floors fast then you might actually crack and break other parts of the house so we just got it stabilized under there for now and will work on fixing all the walls, ceilings and floors next. The good thing is that the tile in the bathroom that was cracking at night and waking me up has stopped. That is a relief. It used to crack and our dog would bark. One night it woke me up at like 3 a.m. right before we did the project with a huge cracking sound. The crack literally started and went all the way up the corner in like a month. Perhaps the foundation was the majority of the issue. There were beams that were literally not resting on anything because the historic mortar had deteriorated and the piers had sunk. I guess we’ll find out but I’m not going to wait that long. Twas the night before Christmas… And all through the house…creatures were stirring. RATS. We keep our house pretty clean. I do the dishes every night due to the cockroaches. I’m not a fan. There were like two days where I lapsed because I was urgently finishing a project but then I got right back on it. I was feeling very guilty about this until someone told me that when they renovate old houses around here the rats scatter and look for a new home. Turns out we had a house across the street where some questionable activities were taking place and the people just got kicked out. I don’t know how or why there was just a realtor lock on the door one day. They just renovated that house including wrapping it in plastic and fumigating it. A guy working over there told me you could literally stick your fingers through the wall. They have been fixing that up for a few months and now it is beautiful. I wonder if that was the source of our problems. I discovered the rats when I opened the drawer where our oven mitts are and — this so gross but I’m sharing anyway — one of the oven mitts was chewed up and there was rat poop in the drawer. My husband does a lot of the cooking (which I love — I’m a lucky gal) and insists he didn’t see it. Anyway I was about to throw up and I threw ALL the mitts away, took everything out of the drawers until I could solve the problem, and proceeded to disinfect those drawers. I also washed all the towels. ACK. We did various things to eradicate the critters. We already have an exterminator and I immediately called them and they immediately had someone come out and reposition the outdoor rat traps which I think made no difference. I started opening the drawer each night, burning a candle in it, and spraying air freshener everywhere on top of scrubbing everything with lemon counter cleaner since I read they don’t like that smell. I got peppermint balls and we have one of those ultrasonic devices which I’m not convinced does much. The peppermint balls didn’t seem to deter our rats either. But in the meantime, about those chimney caps. Our dog had been sniffing around one of the downstairs fireplaces. We had it covered up with a whiteboard when the birds were in the chimney and a tv in front of the fireplace. That was a temporary configuration until we got the chimney cap on there and we want to move a couch that is too big for the room into the back room once that is fixed. I was afraid to even move that whiteboard fearing there might be a rat’s nest behind it. Was the dog smelling rats in our chimney? Well, that question was answered when a rat ran into the living room while we were eating and watching TV. I screamed and my husband claims he never saw it and doesn’t even believe they exist I guess. I immediately called the exterminator again and they came back and put in some sticky traps inside and told me there was nothing behind that white board. Phew. I saw that rat another time and asked for a quote to block all the holes like our exterminator recommended. $7,000. To plug holes. For RATS. That is not what I want to spend $7,000 on right now. Some other people including my mom recommended other types of rat poison and traps and I researched how to plug the holes on the house. There are a lot of complications with that like we plan to tear off and change parts of the house where holes need to be fixed. But that said, I knew some of the primary entry points besides the attic. Chimneys. Under sinks. Any other holes. So I frantically call the gutter company and Greg came out ON CHRISTMAS EVE to help us out. THANK YOU. I knew they would take care of it. I read that rats can go on roofs down chimneys so that solves one problem. We already had the flashing around the chimneys patched up and all the holes in and around the roof for the most part. There are some other holes where they can get into the attic we will deal with later. But my theory is if we can plug the holes inside the house at least they can only get into the attic and under the house — and we have other mitigations for them in those locations. I researched and figured out how we can patch up the chimneys we never use and don’t plan to but before doing that I burned a ton of incense in the problematic fireplace. Supposedly this could be a fire hazard but it’s just smoke not fire and I was watching it. I blocked off the fireplace so the smoke from the incense would mostly go up the chimney. I was reading how people smoke moles out of their holes and such and that gave me the idea to smoke them out. I don’t know if it helped or not but I don’t think they could be in the chimneys while I was doing it. And right after I did that the chimney caps went on. So if the only way they could get into the chimneys was through the roof that is no longer an option. Next I will block the chimneys so they can’t get from inside the chimney into the rooms in case they can get from the attic down the chimneys somehow. I also read about rat trails and it was really clear that the rats were coming up through the holes around the kitchen sink plumbing. I had put a liner in there and blocked the holes to try to block bugs but the rats chewed right through it. I figured out how to block those holes with wire after reading up on exclusion and spent the day before Christmas Eve working on that disgusting project. I threw out the exterminator’s sticky trap with rat droppings all over it. Clearly that wasn’t effective. After researching all this I figured that the rats were coming up through that hole and going behind the cabinets into the drawer with the mitts. Hopefully that is now cut off. I had already blocked the wide open holes in the wall behind the oven with insulation and put great stuff in a lot of the cracks between things in the kitchen but I hadn’t done a good enough job on this hole under the sink — and ultimately now I think that was the primary entry point for both varmints and bugs. What I also learned was that you should use steel wool to plug any holes in your house except those that could be exposed to water. For the holes exposed to water you should use copper wool. I bought all that off Amazon and started plugging any other holes I could find. I also got some stronger rat poison (sorry rat lovers) off Amazon and going to put that around the chimneys in the attic because our exterminator said there was evidence of recent activity up there. Phew. Joy. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. Hopefully 2026 is our year for fun home improvement! So about that structural engineering design… I was trying to design the new architecture to work with the existing pilings with one exception — a small wall that I want to move where the two pilings below it possibly have to move but we’ll see what our engineer says when we get there. That way we will hopefully minimize the changes to fix the structural problems as far as the blocks under the house are concerned. In other words where those deck beams are resting on the roof on cement blocks, pull them to the edge of the house so the posts go from the deck all the way down to the ground on top of existing pilings. Although the structural engineer would not look at the future plans, I did ask for one request. I don’t even know how to read his plans — I didn’t really try because I just trusted those guys all knew what they were talking about and would do the right thing. But I asked him to just make sure all the piers or pilings (blocks) in the back of the house support as much weight as the pilings on the side that already support two stories. I figure (is this logical?) that if the pilings can support two stories then they will be able to support one story and a deck posts. No? So what I am hoping (TBD) is that those piers will support moving the deck posts off the roof to the edge of the house with no additional changes to the bricks, blocks, and cement underneath them. We’ll see. We may still need to make revisions depending on how all the weight gets distributed when we deal with that beam in the back room. These are things I have no clue about and have not bothered to research. I have my own work to do. But we have two weird roofs — an old and new one — on the back of the house and I’m not sure if and how those can be moved or changed and what sort of beams need to go where to support that. I’ve heard talks of ibeams and such and I don’t know how that all works or if we even need those if we change the back ceiling to be supported by the perimeter support. I am planning to keep doors and windows between existing beams and such so hopefully that keeps it simpler but we’ll find out. I’ve got various recommendations and connections and trying to figure out how we will proceed in the new year. All I know is I lived in remodels growing up so I know what that is like. The front half of our house seems to be mostly fine for the moment. We can block off the back part. But then maybe we can’t. Stay tuned if you really want to know. So you say you want a house… When you buy a house it’s not just the cost of the house you’ll need to consider as you’re probably aware. Foundation issues are no joke. Over $25K. Structural engineer — multiple thousands. Architect — over $10K and maybe more than the original estimate when all said and done. Drainage — $12K. Back yard projects, gardening, storage, grill gazebo, outdoor wiring and plumbing issues > $15K. Bathroom project > $10K. Sewer line and plumbing issues $4K? Roof, chimneys, gutters, leaks > $15K. Indoor fans, temporary support beams, drywall, wiring projects, plumbing issues, fix attic stairs, etc. etc. etc. ??? Oh and the biggest projects are not done yet. And in some other parts of the country these prices might be even higher. Even with all those issues, we love our house and I’m just looking forward to the day when it’s all done! Unfortunately this is why I don’t have a lot of bandwidth to work for free and donate time everywhere right now when people ask me for my time. We have a lot of bills to pay. Looks like this will be my focus again in 2026. I’m hoping that some of my research in the AI and security space will pay off and will mostly be going to fix more house issues at the moment. I’m working on tools to improve my coverage on penetration tests. We’ll see how that works out. As always, health, family, and friends come first, but I’m hopeful that we make some progress on all of the above.

    "title": "Was CISOs von Moschusochsen lernen können",
    "summary": "Von Moschusochsen können sich CISOs eine Scheibe abschneiden – wenn es nach unserem Autor geht. Wirestock Creators – shutterstock.com Drittanbieter-Risikomanagement ist für CISOs und Sicherheitsentscheider eine signifikante Herausforderung. Wird sie nicht (richtig) gestemmt, drohen weitreichende geschäftliche Konsequenzen – bis hin zum Stillstand der Produktion. Das wurde in den vergangenen Monaten von diversen Cyberattacken auf Drittanbieter unterstrichen. Zum Beispiel, als die russische Hackergruppe APT29 (auch bekannt als “Cozy Bear”) im Juni 2024 die kostenlose Remote-Access-Software TeamViewer ins Visier nahm , die im Unternehmensumfeld weit verbreitet ist. Selbst, wenn Sie TeamViewer nicht einsetzen – ähnliche Tools gibt es auch von diversen, anderen Anbietern. Beispielsweise von Perimeter81, AnyDesk, GoToMyPC oder LogMeIn. Die entscheidenden Fragen sind dabei: Welcher Drittanbieter wird als nächstes angegriffen? Und können Sie es sich leisten, diesbezüglich ein Risiko einzugehen? Drittanbieter sind Ihr schwächstes Glied Leider verlassen sich so gut wie alle Unternehmen in zu hohem Maße auf zu viele verschiedene Drittanbieter, die in ihre Softwarelieferketten und Geschäftsprozesse eingebettet sind. Dabei reden wir nicht über zwei oder drei Third-Party-Partner, sondern mit Blick auf populäre Software-as-a-Service-Angebote eher über Hunderte oder Tausende, auf die sich Unternehmen jeden Tag verlassen. Das Risiko, das einer Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern inhärent ist, steigt entsprechend drastisch an – und nicht nur, wenn ihre Anzahl überhandnimmt. Weitere Risikofaktoren in diesem Bereich sind beispielsweise: Eingeschränkte Transparenz. So gut wie alle Anbieter bieten potenziellen Kunden diverse Daten an, um ihre Fähigkeiten anzupreisen. Dabei kommen in einigen Fällen allerdings Informationen zum Einsatz, die nicht aktuell sind und somit die aktuelle Risikolage nicht adäquat widerspiegeln. Mehr Komplexität. Diverse Drittanbieter arbeiten selbst mit Zulieferern und Subunternehmen zusammen, von denen Sie möglicherweise nichts wissen. Unausgereifte Prozesse. Nicht wenige Third-Party-Anbieter arbeiten mit Cybersecurity-Richtlinien und -Standards, die weniger ausgereift sind als Ihre eigenen. Geringere Investitionen. Letztgenannter Punkt hängt oft auch damit zusammen, dass viele Drittanbieter ein begrenztes Budget für Cybersicherheit zur Verfügung haben. Das kann sich auf das Sicherheitsniveau ihrer Tools und Services auswirken. Zwar wurde eine Reihe von Best Practices und Playbooks entwickelt, um diese Lücken zu schließen – diese haben sich in weiten Teilen allerdings nicht bewährt: Vendor Assessments verkommen regelmäßig zu papierbasierten “Ankreuzübungen”, die nur Zeit fressen, aber nicht dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren. Auch im Rahmen von Vertragsverhandlungen dafür sorgen zu wollen, dass strengere Sicherheitsanforderungen bei Drittanbietern angelegt werden, hat in vielen Fällen nichts bewirkt. Einige Unternehmen setzen auf Continuous Monitoring, um einen Überblick und mehr, datengetriebene Einblicke in das Sicherheitsniveau von Drittanbietern zu erhalten. Andere implementieren mit Blick auf Third-Party-Partner Incident-Response-Pläne , um Strategien zu entwickeln und einzuüben, falls es bei diesen zu einem Sicherheitsvorfall kommt. Insbesondere die letzten beiden Punkte können für Unternehmen hilfreich sein. Allerdings adressieren auch diese Maßnahmen das Risiko in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbietern nicht vollumfänglich. Vielmehr stellen sie ein Mittel dar, um zu überwachen und zu reagieren, falls es zu einer Cyberattacke kommt . Die Moschusochsen-Strategie Ich bin stolzes Mitglied des “Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center” ( FS-ISAC ) und habe zusammen mit anderen CISOs aus der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche den Vorsitz des strategischen Ausschusses in der Asien-Pazifik-Region inne. Das Konsortium bietet Finanzdienstleistern auf der ganzen Welt ein umfassendes Cyber-Intelligence-Netzwerk, um sich untereinander über möglicherweise bevorstehende oder bereits laufende Angriffskampagnen auszutauschen. Weil viele verschiedene Unternehmen der Branche mit unterschiedlich ausgeprägtem Knowhow und Ressourcen an Bord sind, sind die Mitglieder in der Lage, eine umfassende Perspektive zu erhalten, die sie alleine nicht erreichen könnten. Das FS-ISAC ist insofern ein hervorragendes Beispiel dafür, wie wir als Sicherheitsentscheider zusammenarbeiten können, um uns besser gegen Risiken abzusichern . Das ist die Essenz dessen, was ich als “Moschusochsenstrategie” bezeichne. Der Hintergrund: Werden Moschusochsen von Wölfen angegriffen, bildet die Herde einen Kreis, in dessen Mitte sich die schwächeren Mitglieder befinden. Die Hörner der “Frontline”-Tiere sind dabei nach außen positioniert. Für die Angreifer ist dieser gemeinschaftliche Verteidigungswall kaum noch zu überwinden. Ich bin der festen Überzeugung, dass sich diese Strategie auch auf das Drittanbieter-Risikomanagement übertragen lässt. Ähnlich wie bei den Moschusochsen die Kälber sind die Drittanbieter, auf die wir uns verlassen, die schwächsten Herdenmitglieder. Werden Sie in Mitleidenschaft gezogen, wirkt sich das auf unsere kritischen Geschäftsprozesse aus . Der Unterschied zu den Moschusochsen: Wir bilden keinen Kreis, in dessen Mitte sich die Drittanbieter befinden. Stattdessen wäre es angebracht, sich im Kollektiv darüber auszutauschen, wenn die Sorge besteht, dass die Cybersecurity-Maßnahmen bei einem Third-Party-Anbieter zu wünschen übriglassen und verstärkt werden sollten. Noch wichtiger wäre allerdings eine gemeinsame Übereinkunft darüber, den Drittanbieter bei seinen Bemühungen zu unterstützen. Das würde potenziell Koordinationsarbeit und unter Umständen auch eine Neuverhandlung von Verträgen erfordern – hätte aber den Vorteil, diese Schwachstelle, die uns alle betrifft, besser absichern zu können. Von der Theorie zur Praxis Ein solches Zusammenwirken könnte unter Juristen durchaus Bedenken aufwerfen – Stichwort Wettbewerbsrecht. Dennoch hat der Moschusochsenansatz das Potenzial, die Risikolage in Sachen Drittanbieter entscheidend zu verbessern – und Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen, Third-Party-Risiken besser zu managen. Das könnte – zum Beispiel – folgendermaßen aussehen: Bestimmen Sie, welche Drittanbieter Ihnen am meisten Sorgen bereiten und erstellen Sie eine “Hot List”. Tauschen Sie sich mit anderen Unternehmen aus, um diese Liste abzugleichen und die Kandidaten zu ermitteln, die Sie gemeinsam haben. Verhandeln Sie über einen gemeinschaftlichen “Schutzschild” für diese Anbieter. Denselben Ansatz haben wir bei FS-ISAC als möglichen Weg für die Zukunft diskutiert. Die ersten beiden Schritte sind relativ simpel zu bewerkstelligen – der dritte macht hingegen deutlich mehr Aufwand, aber auch den entscheidenden Unterschied. Ein praktischer Ansatz, um diesen umzusetzen, könnte dabei darin bestehen, dass die größten Unternehmen eine Führungsrolle einnehmen und kleinere unter ihre Fittiche nehmen. Vergessen sollten Sie dabei nicht, dass auch die Moschusochsen-Strategie ihre Grenzen hat: Wenn ein Bär angreift, machen sich auch Moschusochsen aus dem Staub – dann ist jeder auf sich allein gestellt. Das lässt sich ebenfalls auf die Cybersicherheit übertragen: Je mächtiger der Feind, desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass der Angriff in einen Kampf ums blanke Überleben ausartet. Aber auch wenn diese Strategie nicht auf jedes Szenario anwendbar ist, könnte sie unser kollektives Risiko erheblich minimieren.

And don't worry...I know after 2025, there are folks out there expecting a flaming bag full of dog poop dropped off on their doorstep, but rest assured...this isn't that. Anyway, as I was working on this post, it just sort of rolled into 2026, so I'll start off my first post of the year with a grab bag of things I found interesting right there at the end of 2025. What's in your Registry? CloudSEK recently shared this write-up on Silver Fox ; what I found most interesting was from \"Stage 4 - Valley RAT\", \"Stage 2\". Apparently, Valley RAT maintains configuration information in the following Registry path: HKCU\\Console In addition, downloaded plugins are stored in the following path: HKCU\\Console\\0\\d33f351a4aeea5e608853d1a56661059 All of this means that not only can you get a great deal of info, and develop a great deal of intel from the entries themselves, but they're also tied to a specific user account. When creating a timeline, paths like those used by the Valley RAT should really stand out. Speaking of Registry and persistence, DeceptIQ shared this write-up on Registry persistence on 27 Dec 2025. As long as I've been working with Windows systems...going back to about 1995, much further if we're talking about \"using\"...this isn't something that I've ever heard of, nor have I run across anything like this. Interestingly enough, the authors didn't just talk about the technique and reference it, but they also linked to a means for creating an NTUSER.MAN file, and even shared how the whole process might look. Information Sharing If you're interested in how shellcode is \"used\" on Windows systems, Valli-Nayagam Chokkalingam over at Adversary Craft shared this \"101\" write-up that you might find useful. I can't say that the write-up leads to viable detection methodologies, as ultimately, finding the shellcode amounts to seeing the bytes in Explorer.exe process memory. However, it is a good \"101\" level write-up for folks to start developing familiarity with the topic. A bit of \"saving the best for last\", but keeping up the \"info sharing\" theme, Brett shared a look back to the early days of DF/IR, and how it was built on PDFs and coffee . I remember those days, because at one point I was writing some of those PDFs, and reading many others. I was reading a lot of the docs that got shared not only to get the information from them, but also to help develop my writing style so that what I wrote up would be entertaining and useful to others. One of the thoughts that Brett's post brought to mind is how we consume information has changed over time. Like Brett said, it used to be PDFs, and in some cases, meeting for coffee (or beer/adult beverages). I started blogging in 2004 because at the time, it seemed like a great way to share information, in one easy-to-reach, easy-to-find location. I know that even since then, there have been folks who've been really successful with YouTube channels, some even getting to the point where they're sponsored. Also, training courses, even those that are self-paced and available online, have been available for some time. In his book Call Sign Chaos , Mattis said that \"our own personal experiences are not enough to sustain us.\" While this statement was directed at warfighters, it remains true for other endeavors, as well, and in particular, the various aspects of cybersecurity. Mattis talked about reading thousands of books, and even described his own reading to expand his knowledge ahead of a campaign. Brett taled about PDFs as a means of sharing knowledge and experiences. In both cases, it's incumbent upon someone to write, to document their experiences and share that knowledge.",

It allows remote clients to extract uninitialized heap memory from the MongoDB process using nothing more than valid compressed wire-protocol messages. This is not native RCE . It is a memory leak. it does not leave a lot of traces, It is silent, repeatable, and reachable before authentication. At internet scale, that combination matters more than exploit glamour. TL;DR for engineering teams What broke MongoDB’s zlib decompression path trusts attacker-controlled length metadata. Impact Unauthenticated heap memory disclosure. What leaks Raw process memory fragments including credentials, tokens, config strings, runtime metadata, and recently processed data. Auth required None. Noise level Low. No crashes.

When a client negotiates compression, each compressed message includes an uncompressedSize field. The vulnerable flow looks like this: Client sends a syntactically valid compressed MongoDB wire-protocol message Message declares an inflated uncompressedSize MongoDB allocates a heap buffer of that declared size zlib inflates only the real payload into the start of the buffer The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON BSON parsing walks past real data into leftover heap memory Memory gets leaked out, not a lot of IOC to detect Root cause (code-level) The vulnerability originates in MongoDB’s zlib message decompression logic: src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cpp In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returned: return {output.length()}; output.length() represents the allocated buffer size , not the number of bytes actually written by ::uncompress(). If the attacker declares a larger uncompressedSize than the real decompressed payload, MongoDB propagates the allocated size forward. Downstream BSON parsing logic consumes memory beyond the true decompression boundary. The fix replaces this with: return length; length is the actual number of bytes written by the decompressor. Additional regression tests were added in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly reject undersized decompression results with ErrorCodes::BadValue. This closes the disclosure path. Why is this reachable pre-auth Compression negotiation occurs before authentication. The exploit does not require: malformed compression streams memory corruption primitives race conditions timing dependencies It relies on: attacker-controlled metadata valid compression Incorrect length propagation Any network client can trigger it, hence is super easy to deploy Exploitation reality A working proof of concept exists and is public, more details: Original PoC by Joe Desimone https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed/ Technical analysis and reproduction details https://doublepulsar.com/merry-christmas-day-have-a-mongodb-security-incident-9537f54289eb Github Exploit for Mongobleed: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main Github Scanner for web: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/scanner Scanner for Code: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847/tree/main/code-sca The PoC: negotiates compression sends crafted compressed messages iterates offsets dumps leaked memory fragments to disk and saves it locally No credentials required. No malformed packets. Repeatable probing. What actually leaks Heap memory is messy. That is the point. Observed and expected leak content includes: database credentials SCRAM material session tokens API keys WiredTiger config strings file paths container metadata client IPs and connection details fragments of recently processed documents The PoC output already shows real runtime artifacts. This is not RCE, but steals pieces of memory, which is not as bad as RCE but still very dangerous (Heartbleed anyone) MongoBleed does not provide native remote code execution. There is no instruction pointer control. No shellcode injection. No crash exploitation. What it provides is privilege discovery . Memory disclosure enables: credential reuse token replay service-to-service authentication CI/CD compromise cloud control plane access A leaked Kubernetes token is better than RCE. A leaked CI token is persistent RCE. A leaked cloud role is full environment control. This is RCE-adjacent through legitimate interfaces. How widespread is this MongoDB is everywhere. Shodan telemetry captured on 29 December 2025 shows: 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances Version breakdown (port 27017): Version Count Query All versions 201,659 product:\"MongoDB\" port:27017 8.2.x 3,164 \"8.2.\" 8.0.x (≠8.0.17) 13,411 \"8.0.\" -\"8.0.17\" 7.0.x (≠7.0.28) 19,223 \"7.0.\" -\"7.0.28\" 6.0.x (≠6.0.27) 3,672 \"6.0.\" -\"6.0.27\" 5.0.x (≠5.0.32) 1,887 \"5.0.\" -\"5.0.32\" 4.4.x (≠4.4.30) 3,231 \"4.4.\" -\"4.4.30\" 4.2.x 3,138 \"4.2.\" 4.0.x 3,145 \"4.0.\" 3.6.x 1,145 \"3.6.\" Most are directly exposed on the default port, not shielded behind application tiers. Core behaviors that matter Unauthenticated Any client can trigger it. Remote and repeatable Memory offsets can be probed over time. Low noise No crashes. Logs stay quiet. Data agnostic Whatever was on the heap becomes fair game. This favors patient actors and automation. Detection guidance IOC Identification Network-level signals Look for: Inbound traffic to port 27017 compressed MongoDB messages Repeated requests with: large declared uncompressedSize small actual payloads high request frequency without auth attempts Process-level signals Watch for: elevated CPU on mongod without query load repeated short-lived connections memory allocation spikes abnormal BSON parsing warnings Post-leak fallout Check for: new MongoDB users role changes admin command usage anomalies auth attempts from unfamiliar IPs API key failures cloud IAM abuse new outbound connections If you see filesystem artifacts or shells, you are already past exploitation. Temporary protections If you cannot upgrade immediately: Disable zlib compression Remove zlib from networkMessageCompressors Restrict network access Remove direct internet exposure Enforce allowlists These are stopgaps. The bug lives in the server - hence patch Tooling and validation A full test suite is available, combining: exploit lab (vulnerable + patched instances) network scanner code scanner for repos and Dockerfiles Repository: https://github.com/Security-Phoenix-demo/mongobleed-exploit-CVE-2025-14847 This allows: safe reproduction exposure validation pre-deployment detection Why this one matters MongoBleed does not break crypto it breaks data and memory The database trusts client-supplied lengths. Attackers live for that assumption. Databases are part of your application attack surface. Infrastructure bugs leak application secrets. Vulnerability management without reachability is incomplete. Patch this. Then ask why it was reachable. submitted by /u/Diligent-Side4917 [link] [comments]",

I’ve put together a deep-dive forensic breakdown of exactly how the architecture failed. The TL;DR on the Architectural Breakdown: The Entry Point: A legacy Citrix remote access portal that was never fully migrated to modern identity governance. [ 05:02 ] The Fatal Flaw: Zero MFA. Valid credentials were used to walk right through the \"front door\" without a single challenge. [ 01:27 , 06:54 ] The 9-Day Dwell Time: Attackers spent over a week \"living off the land,\" blending into normal admin traffic to map domain controllers and move laterally. [ 07:30 , 08:02 ] Exfiltration Scale: Approximately 6TB of data (touching 1 in 3 US patient records) was stolen before the encryption payload was even detonated. [ 02:30 , 08:26 ] The Reliability Paradox: The systemic outage was actually triggered by the containment effort. Severing the \"infected limb\" logically and physically also killed the essential transaction engines and redundancy systems that were too tightly coupled to the primary infrastructure. [ 09:13 , 09:30 ] Key Takeaways for Senior Engineers & Architects: Identity is the New Perimeter: Firewalls are irrelevant if your IdP is weak. Without MFA on every single external entry point, you don’t have a perimeter; you have a welcome mat. [ 12:05 , 12:30 ] The M&A Quarantine Rule: Assume any acquired network is already compromised. Treat it as \"hostile internet\" until every endpoint meets your security baseline. Do not bridge the networks prematurely. [ 12:43 , 12:58 ] Complexity is the Sanctuary of the Adversary: The more complex your legacy footprint, the more shadows there are for attackers to hide in.

    "summary": "First, I want to point out that AI/ML does not refer to LLMs, either their use/development of, or ability to integrate them into their own particular skill set. I'm referring to the use of unsupervised learning, clustering, embeddings, regression analysis, pattern detection, time series analysis...you know, that stuff. I'm a senior level analyst (threat hunter) that specializes in data science and machine learning. I picked up the additional skills while learning how to hunt through data to detect anomalies and how to differentiate them from normal behaviors but I use those as analytical tools. To paint a clearer picture, I code out these models and representations myself rather than using typical tools and bolted-on capabilities in existing SIEMs, so it's still much more into the weeds in the DS side. I mention that above to ask if those types of skills are sought after while looking through applications and resumes. I rarely see them in many job postings that aren't DS-specific roles. Personally, I see these skills as highly desirable in a top-tier analyst when paired with a competency and exposure to many of the most common tools and platforms in modern security operations because most of secops is reactive with extra time being available to proficient analysts who can knock out alerts quickly and efficiently. That extra time should be spent digging through data, low-level alerts, and logs, looking for anything that might have been missed. It doesn't need to be said that that is a lot of data to dive into. The bottleneck is analysts' ability to parse the information and correlate. And here is where I find those DS/ML skills really paying off. Sure, there's some bootstrapping time invested in building out a pipeline but once that is done (correctly) and it's put to use, it hoovers in data and spits out knowledge objects useful for hunting and meta-analysis. Sorry if it sounds like I'm on a soapbox, I was trying to explain the benefits of having the skills. Rather than relying on LLMs or bolted-on AI agents in security appliances to find the things that are missed, having a human involved in that process is necessary and would be an advantageous posture. Someone who isn't knowledgeable doesn't help because you don't know what you don't know (ie, lacking threat hunting and/or DS skills) and also, we know that LLMs hallucinate. I'm not dogging chatbots and intelligent agents, I'm just trying to block the \"yea, we use AI (LLMs) for that\" argument. Getting back to the original question--are those skills a plus for the roles you are looking to fill? Would you pass up a candidate if they had those skills over a similar candidate who didn't? Are leads in your organization looking to bring both cyber analytical and DS/ML skills together into a single role? Plainly stated: everyone has heard that the mythical unicorn would be amazing to have on their team but is anyone out there willing to actually capture and embrace one? submitted by /u/WadeEffingWilson [link] [comments]",

We're now evaluating a proper secure remote access (SRA) solution and have been looking seriously at BeyondTrust and CyberArk , since they're the most established names. That said, we've also had a few conversations with Cyolo . On paper, their approach seems much more OT-friendly (identity-based, application-level access, less network complexity), but they're obviously far less known than the prominent PAM vendors.

The Post-American Internet (permalink) On December 28th, I delivered a speech entitled \"A post-American, enshittification-resistant internet\" for 39C3, the 39th Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Germany. This is the transcript of that speech. https://archive.org/download/doctorow-39c3/39c3-1421-eng-A_post-American_enshittification-resistant_internet.mp4 Many of you know that I'm an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF. I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call \"The War on General Purpose Computing.\" If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the \"Broadcast Protection Discussion Group,\" an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators. They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders. That rule was called \"the Broadcast Flag,\" and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule. We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years. Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked. Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack! And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door. Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a \"Post-American Internet,\" a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not happy about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say \"When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla.\" The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage. That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos. A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are everything. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want all the same thing as the original forces, but want enough of the same things to fight on their side. That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described \"libertarians\" who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel. And what's got me so excited is that we've got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but also people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, and national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty. My thesis here is that this is an unstoppable coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp. # So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the \"War on General Purpose Computing.\" That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is \"anticircumvention,\" Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true whether or not your modification violates any other law. Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an \"access control\" for a copyrighted work. So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about how to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even describe how they access a device or system face criminal liability. Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects. This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls \"Felony Contempt of Business Model.\" Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every other country in the world has passed a law just like this in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive. Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges. But why would Europe pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech importer. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this? Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which other countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question. Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law. Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws. Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws. And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too. I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft? Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me. They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, \"You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry.\" That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash. The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now! I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day? So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: \"Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you.\" This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking Greenland. Capitulation is a failure. But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy more expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says \"Ouch!\" And it's indiscriminate. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada. But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law? If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad. Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit. Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their own government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product. So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing. It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just one example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a 30 percent commission on every euro spent inside of an app. 30 percent! That's such a profitable business that Apple makes $100 billion per year on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors. Those competitors could offer a 90% discount every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and still make $10b/year. Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then Apple would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking. As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" With these guys, it's always \"disruption for thee, but not for me.\" When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral. Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break kings! It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class. I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly not an accelerationist. Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of. And while those stores could use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be more expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps. When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR. It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones. All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover. Back in October, Apple kicked the \"ICE Block\" app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a \"protected class,\" and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons. And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy. Apple's margin could be their opportunity. Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a much better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs. For one thing, this is a targeted response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais. Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans and everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies. It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in. So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars selling that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world. That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings. Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars? Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who I believe. This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service. The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire nation. The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to hack Outlook to brick the ICC – they own Outlook. Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose any of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he \"couldn't guarantee\" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened. It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em. John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they can't brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government. Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to \"digital sovereignty.\" But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned \"digital sovereignty\" from a nice-to-have into a must-have. So finally, we're seeing some movement, like \"Eurostack,\" a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on. But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories. We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are not going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform. Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers. Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work without the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it West Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall. Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation. So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be totally unreliable. This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks. This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the \"Underground Empire.\" But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump. Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links. But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub. It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy. They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use? Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world. Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem. But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative. No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start. But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code. This project is the only one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country. It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances. We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working. The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – those are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years. Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users, balancing out that liability among many players. Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's good that they've got a chatbot that \"produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer.\" Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale. This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that can't do your job. Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the workers stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt. Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers. When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: \"Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act.\" Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a fucking idiot suit and tell you \"Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie.\" Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit. AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders. When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship. But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you. Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing. Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't real. Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an \"NPC,” or all those \"Effective Altruists,\" who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today. Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the \"Genesis\" program, declaring that the US would begin generating annual \"moonshot\"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists. Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real. Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to do things telling you \"no.\" AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory. Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to reduce tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty. Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously? But crises precipitate change. Remember when another mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years behind in its energy transition, to ten years ahead of schedule. Because when you're shivering the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony. But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass. Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. Any country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder. Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter. Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive \"K-shaped\" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages. So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation. The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger. America is chasing the \"world without people\" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself. Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military \"right to repair\" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine. The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own. But what if European firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. \"Good news,\" because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable. Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year. Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic. Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share any of that money with BMW and Mercedes. Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest \"tax-inversion\" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea. Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed. It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people. There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company \"helpfully\" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform \"diagnostics,\" which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros. Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products. So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks. I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry \"Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?\" The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability. By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit. Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on. Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking weird how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding who you want to talk to? The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit. It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet! Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box. Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am hopeful. Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed. Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair. All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I and Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in China. This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power. Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations. The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level. And never forget that the post-American internet will be good for Americans. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies. The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a victim of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech. That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world. The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too. And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It's gonna be great.

    "summary": "I work on the internal security team at a regulated payments company. We process card transactions for other businesses, so outages immediately hit revenue and compliance nerves at the same time. The incident response bridge was opened when a supplier that handles part of our transaction routing began timing out during peak volume. At the beginning it was framed as an availability issue, with transactions backing up and pressure building to provide a clear restoration timeline to the business. I joined because the integration touches regulated data, but the expectation was still that security would stay in the background unless something obviously malicious surfaced. About half an hour in, while people were debating rollback options, I started looking at the logs we were sharing. The retry traffic looked wrong. Requests were hitting endpoints that are not part of the documented production path. The supplier kept repeating that nothing had changed and that they were failing over internally to keep service alive. What they did not mention until later was that the failover path routes through an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked, which is why no alarms fired, but it bypasses one of our monitoring layers and handles data differently. We never designed it to run under load, let alone during an incident. At that point I said out loud that this stopped being a clean outage. The response was immediate pushback. Procurement jumped in to say the supplier had already been reviewed and approved. Someone referenced the third-party record and said Panorays showed no active issues, like that settled the question. The score had not changed, so in their minds the risk had not either. I am watching live traffic move through a path we do not actively control while the incident is still in progress and recovery speed has become the dominant concern. Everyone else wants to keep the scope narrow so the bridge can be closed and the issue treated as resolved. I am stuck trying to explain why a system behaving exactly as it was never meant to behave cannot just be dismissed as operational noise. How do I push to reclassify this without being remembered as the person who delayed recovery and forced old approval decisions back into active dispute? submitted by /u/Dismal_Marzipan1430 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Best phishing awareness platforms for 2025/2026: addressing realism gaps in internal security training.",
    "summary": "Over the last few years, phising awareness platforms and simulation softwares have become standard across orgs of all sizes. Most security teams now run phishing simulations, tracks and measures employees through dashboard and reports. Despite this, real world phishing attacks and business email compromise incidents continue to succeed. A common issue is that many phishing programs rely heavily on external phishing templates, training employees to recognize patterns rather than make decisions in realistic workplace scenarios. Approval request, shared docs, internal messages remain a frequent source of security fail. These attacks closely mirror everyday workflows and are often underrepresented in traditional phishing awareness training. As phishing techniques evolve in 2026, including AI generated phishing and highly targeted spear phishing, the gap between phishing simulations metrics and real risk is becoming harder to ignore. Reduced risk rates do not always translate into improved security behaviour. We are currently evaluating phishing awareness software and prevention platforms, looking for approaches that move beyond template driven simulations and focus on realistic phishing scenarios, internal and external context, and measurable reduction in human risk. Interested to hearhow others are addressing internal phishing threats today, whether by extending existing tools or exploring newer phishing awareness platforms designed around realism and less focusing on scores. submitted by /u/Ok-Author-6130 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Critical vulnerability in IBM API Connect could allow authentication bypass",
    "summary": "IBM is urging customers to quickly patch a critical vulnerability in its API Connect platform that could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication. The company describes API Connect as a full lifecycle application programming interface (API) gateway used “to create, test, manage, secure, analyze, and socialize APIs.” It particularly touts it as a way to “unlock the potential of agentic AI” by providing a central point of control for access to AI services via APIs. The platform also includes API Agent, which automates tasks across the API lifecycle using AI. A key component is a customizable self-service portal that allows developers to easily onboard themselves, and to discover and consume multiple types of API, including SOAP, REST, events, ASyncAPIs, GraphQL, and others. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-13915 , affects IBM API Connect versions 10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5, and version 10.0.11.0, and could give unauthorized access to the exposed applications, with no user interaction required. An architectural assumption is broken “CVE-2025-13915 is not best understood as a security bug,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia , chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “It is better understood as a moment where a long standing architectural assumption finally breaks in the open. The assumption is simple and deeply embedded in enterprise design: If traffic passes through the API gateway, identity has been enforced and trust has been established. This vulnerability proves that assumption can fail completely.” He noted that the classification of the weakness, which maps to CWE-305 , is important because it rules out a whole class of what he called comforting explanations. “This is not stolen credentials. It is not role misconfiguration. It is not a permissions mistake,” he said. “The authentication enforcement itself can be circumvented.” When that happens, he explained, downstream services do not simply face elevated risk, they lose the foundation on which their access decisions were built because they do not revalidate identity. They were never designed to; they inherit trust. “Once enforcement fails upstream, inherited trust becomes unearned trust, and the exposure propagates silently,” he said. “This class of vulnerability aligns with automation, broad scanning, and opportunistic probing rather than careful targeting.” Interim fixes provided IBM said that the issue was discovered during internal testing, and it has provided interim fixes for each affected version of the software, with individual update details for VMware, OCP/CP4I, and Kubernetes. The only mitigation suggested for the flaw, according to IBM’s security bulletin , is this: “Customers unable to install the interim fix should disable self-service sign-up on their Developer Portal if enabled, which will help minimize their exposure to this vulnerability.” The company also notes in its installation instructions for the fixes that the image overrides described in the document must be removed when upgrading to the next release or fixpack. This, said Gogia, further elevates the risk. “That is not a cosmetic detail,” he noted. “Management planes define configuration truth, lifecycle control, and operational authority across the platform. When remediation touches this layer, the vulnerability sits close to the control core, not at an isolated gateway edge. That raises both blast radius and remediation risk.” This is because errors in these areas can turn into prolonged exposure or service instability. “[Image overrides] also introduce a governance hazard: Image overrides create shadow state; if they are not explicitly removed later, they persist quietly,” he pointed out. “Over time, they drift out of visibility, ownership, and audit scope. This is how temporary fixes turn into long term risk.” Most valuable outcome: Learning He added that the operational challenges involved in remediation are not so much in knowing what has to be done, but in doing it fast enough without breaking the business. And, he said, API governance now needs to include up to date inventories of APIs, their versions, dependencies, and exposure points, as well as monitoring of behavior. “The most valuable outcome here is not closure,” Gogia observed. “It is learning. Enterprises should ask what would have happened if this flaw had been exploited quietly for weeks. Which services would have trusted the gateway implicitly? Which logs would have shown abnormal behavior? Which teams would have noticed first? Those answers reveal whether trust assumptions are visible or invisible. Organizations that stop at patching will miss a rare opportunity to strengthen resilience before the next control plane failure arrives.” This article originally appeared on InfoWorld .",
