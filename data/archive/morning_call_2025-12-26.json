  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of a long-standing Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA-bypass flaw; high relevance if we or critical vendors use FortiGate VPNs.\n- New critical vulnerabilities highlighted in LangChain-based AI apps and MongoDB that could expose secrets or enable full server takeover, especially in cloud/SaaS environments.\n- CISA flags active exploitation of Digiever NVR (RCE) and community reports of increased brute force against Palo Alto firewalls, signaling elevated pressure on perimeter/remote-access tech.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN – actively exploited 2FA bypass (5-year-old vuln)**\n  - What happened: Fortinet and multiple sources report active exploitation of an older FortiOS SSL VPN vulnerability that allows 2FA bypass.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct impact on remote access; enables credential theft/session hijack and potential initial access around MFA controls.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm if any Fortinet/FortiGate SSL VPNs are in use (internal or managed providers); if yes, verify version against latest Fortinet advisory and patch/mitigate urgently.  \n    - Today in SOC: hunt VPN logs for: logins without corresponding 2FA challenges, impossible travel, logins from new countries/ASNs, sudden admin logins outside normal patterns.\n\n- **LangChain AI application vulnerability – secret exfiltration**\n  - What happened: Critical flaw in LangChain-based apps can allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive secrets (API keys, credentials) from AI workflows/integrations.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any internal tools or vendors using LangChain for automation or chat interfaces could leak keys that grant broad access (cloud, payments, internal APIs).\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Identify whether any internal AI apps, chatbots, or automation tools use LangChain (ask app/platform teams); if yes, request status vs. latest security guidance and mitigation.  \n    - Monitor for unusual use of API keys/secrets tied to those apps (cloud logs, API gateways); watch for sudden access from new IPs or over-privileged token use.\n\n- **MongoDB high-severity flaw (CVE-2025-14847) – potential server takeover**\n  - What happened: New high-severity MongoDB vulnerability disclosed that can allow server takeover; exploit PoC exists/expected.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct risk to any MongoDB backing customer-facing apps, analytics, or internal services; compromise can expose transactional and PII data.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Ask platform/DB teams for inventory of on-prem/cloud MongoDB and versions; confirm if affected and whether vendor patches/workarounds are applied.  \n    - For exposed MongoDB (internet or DMZ), increase monitoring for anomalous admin ops: new users/roles, changes to auth config, unexpected remote connections.\n\n- **CISA: actively exploited Digiever NVR RCE**\n  - What happened: CISA added a Digiever NVR vulnerability to the KEV catalog; actively exploited to obtain remote code execution on network video recorders.\n  - Why it matters operationally: These devices often sit in internal or semi-trusted networks; compromise offers a stealth foothold and lateral-movement platform.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm with physical security/facilities and network teams if Digiever NVRs are deployed; if yes, check exposure (internet/DMZ) and patch or isolate urgently.  \n    - Today: watch for outbound connections from camera/NVR VLANs to unfamiliar IPs, and any interactive shells/tunnels originating from those segments.\n\n- **Increased brute-force activity on Palo Alto firewalls (community reports)**\n  - What happened: Operators report a spike in brute-force attempts against Palo Alto devices (likely targeting management or VPN portals).\n  - Why it matters operationally: Even if we’re patched, sustained password-spraying/brute force can lead to account compromise or DoS; indicates adversary focus on network edge.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Review PAN logs today for spikes in failed logins, particularly to admin and GlobalProtect portals; validate rate-limiting, lockout, and MFA policies.  \n    - Create/enable alerts for repeated failed logins from single IP/ASN and for successful logins from IPs previously showing high failure counts.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Remote access/VPN exploitation (Fortinet, Palo Alto) – Initial Access (T1133), Valid Accounts (T1078)**\n  - Log sources: VPN/firewall logs, IdP logs, EDR on VPN gateways (if supported).  \n  - Hunt for: logins without expected MFA events, impossible travel, sudden use of dormant accounts, high failed-login counts followed by success.\n\n- **Credential & token abuse from AI/LangChain apps – Credentials in Files (T1552), Use of Valid Accounts (T1078)**\n  - Log sources: Cloud provider logs (CloudTrail, Azure Activity), API gateway logs, OAuth/IdP logs.  \n  - Hunt for: API keys or service accounts suddenly used from new geos, non-corporate IPs, or at unusual volumes; spikes in failed API auth.\n\n- **MongoDB exploitation – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068), Data from Databases (T1105/T1555)**\n  - Log sources: MongoDB audit logs, OS logs on DB servers, WAF/NGFW in front of DB-backed apps.  \n  - Hunt for: new admin roles/users, changes to auth mechanisms, unusual commands (e.g., user management, dump-like activity) from unfamiliar clients.\n\n- **IoT/NVR compromise (Digiever) – Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), Command & Control (T1071)**\n  - Log sources: Network flow/NetFlow, firewall logs around camera/NVR VLANs, any syslog from NVRs.  \n  - Hunt for: outbound connections to rare external IPs/ports, DNS to domains not related to vendor clouds, lateral connections from NVRs to internal servers.\n\n- **General stealth loaders / malware trends (per ThreatsDay bulletin) – Defense Evasion (T1027), Persistence (T1053/T1547)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, email security, web proxy, sandbox detonation.  \n  - Hunt for: low-prevalence binaries in %ProgramData%/temp, LOLBins spawning unusual child processes (e.g., mshta, regsvr32, wscript) and beacon-like network patterns.\n\n- **Windows/Exchange targeting APTs (xHunt reference) – Lateral Movement (T1021), Privilege Escalation (T1068)**\n  - Log sources: Windows event logs (4768–4769, 4624, 4672), Exchange/IIS logs, EDR.  \n  - Hunt for: abnormal PowerShell usage, new mailbox rules/forwarding, service creation, credential-dumping tools, and new admin group memberships.\n\n- **Password spraying / brute-force (Palo Alto, general) – Brute Force (T1110)**\n  - Log sources: VPN/firewall auth logs, IdP, AD.  \n  - Hunt for: distributed low-and-slow attempts across many accounts from same IP/ASN; enable correlation rules and temporary IP blocking where policy allows.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Asset & exposure review for VPNs and remote access**\n  - Maintain up-to-date inventory of all SSL VPNs (Fortinet, Palo Alto, others), with version and exposure; enforce strict SLAs for patching KEV-listed issues.\n\n- **AI/LLM security review**\n  - Conduct a structured review of all internal/external AI/LLM-based services (especially LangChain) to ensure secrets management, isolation, and least-privilege keys.\n\n- **Database hardening and patch cadence (MongoDB, others)**\n  - Validate standard build, encryption, auth, and network segmentation for databases; ensure audit logging is consistently enabled and reviewed.\n\n- **IoT/OT and NVR network segmentation**\n  - Work with physical security to ensure all cameras/NVRs (including Digiever) are segmented, minimally exposed, and covered by vulnerability management and logging.\n\n- **Playbook updates for VPN and AI-app compromise**\n  - Update incident response playbooks to include: VPN 2FA bypass scenarios, cloud/API key abuse from AI tools, and IoT device foothold → lateral movement paths.\n\n- **Awareness for brute-force and credential hygiene**\n  - Reinforce secure password and MFA usage with staff and admins; ensure admin accounts have stronger controls (hardware tokens, IP restrictions where feasible).",
