React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182 & related React/Next.js RSC flaws) – Active exploitation, NK APT, malware delivery\n- **What happened**\n  - Critical vulnerability in **React Server Components / Next.js (React2Shell)** added to **CISA KEV** and is being widely exploited to gain server‑side code execution and pivot to internal APIs.\n  - Campaigns delivering **crypto miners**, **EtherRAT backdoor** (North Korean threat actors), and **PeerBlight Linux malware for proxy tunneling** are reported across multiple sectors.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Any **Internet‑facing React/Next.js app using RSC** may provide **direct access to internal APIs, credentials, and lateral movement** into our environment or third‑party providers.\n  - Financial web portals, customer apps, and internal dashboards using modern JS stacks are at risk of **web‑to‑core environment compromise**.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Triage exposure (with app/platform teams)**\n    - Identify any **Internet‑facing services using React/Next.js with RSC**; confirm versions and patch status.\n    - If we use **managed web providers / SaaS** built on React, verify they have patched.\n  - **Hunt for compromise**\n    - Web logs / WAF: search for **anomalous POSTs or crafted queries** to RSC endpoints, unusual path traversal or template injection‑like patterns around React/Next routes.\n    - Backend: look for **new or unexpected child processes** spawned by node/next runtimes (EDR).\n    - Linux servers: hunt for **new miners**, unusual systemd services, cron jobs, or reverse proxies/tunnels (SSH, socat, Cloudflared‑like patterns).\n  - **Strengthen controls**\n    - Ensure **WAF virtual patching** in place for known React2Shell patterns (coordinate with infra).\n    - Increase monitoring for **suspicious outbound connections** from web tiers to rare external IPs/ports (e.g., 4444, 8080, 1337, high ports).\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Microsoft December 2025 Patch Tuesday & associated 0-days (Windows, Outlook, PowerShell)\n- **What happened**\n  - Microsoft released December updates addressing **~56 vulnerabilities**, including **three zero‑days**, one already used to **hijack Windows devices**.\n  - Separate reporting highlights:\n    - **Windows Defender Firewall Service data disclosure flaw**.\n    - **PowerShell 0‑day RCE**, allowing remote arbitrary code execution.\n    - **Outlook RCE** allowing code execution via crafted content.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Direct impact on **all Windows endpoints and servers**, and **Outlook clients**; typical entry vector for phishing and initial access.\n  - PowerShell/Outlook bugs are **prime candidates for phishing campaigns and lateral movement** inside financial networks.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Patch prioritization (coordinate with IT)**\n    - Confirm **December 2025 cumulative updates** are prioritized for **domain controllers, Exchange/Outlook‑heavy servers, and high‑risk user endpoints** (admins, finance, execs).\n  - **Detection focus**\n    - EDR/Windows logs:\n      - Monitor for **PowerShell execution** with unusual flags (e.g., `-EncodedCommand`, `-nop`, `-w hidden`) from **Office/Outlook child processes**.\n      - Alert on **Outlook spawning scripting/LOLBin processes** (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, wscript.exe, mshta.exe).\n    - Email security:\n      - Heighten inspection of attachments likely to exploit Office/Outlook, especially rarely used formats or **embedded OLE/ActiveX**.\n  - **Hunting**\n    - Timeline‑bound hunt (since Patch Tuesday release) for:\n      - New **Outlook‑initiated PowerShell** or MSI/EXE installers.\n      - **Unusual firewall rule changes** or Defender configuration tampering.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. WinRAR RCE (CVE-2025-6218) – Actively exploited by multiple threat groups\n- **What happened**\n  - **WinRAR vulnerability** added to **CISA KEV**, with multiple groups using it in the wild for RCE when users open crafted archives.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Highly common on **end‑user workstations**, often **unmanaged versions**.\n  - Tight coupling with **phishing and web downloads** (e.g., fake invoices, reports, “password‑protected” archives).\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Asset check**\n    - With endpoint team, identify **installed WinRAR versions**; ensure updates or consider forced removal in corporate images.\n  - **Detection & prevention**\n    - Email/web security: increase scrutiny and sandboxing of **RAR/ZIP/ACE archives, especially from external senders**.\n    - EDR: alert when `winrar.exe` or extraction tools immediately spawn **scripts or binaries** from `%TEMP%` or user profile paths.\n  - **Hunting**\n    - Search for sequences: **email attachment → archive opened → child process execution** within a short time window.\n    - Look for **previous suspicious archive detonations** in sandbox systems.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Ivanti EPM critical flaw (stored XSS → admin session hijack / RCE)\n- **What happened**\n  - Critical vulnerability in **Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM)** enables **stored XSS**, letting attackers hijack **admin sessions** and potentially reach **RCE**; hundreds of exposed EPM instances reported online.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - EPM is a **central management and software distribution platform**; compromise provides **enterprise‑wide code execution** and rapid ransomware deployment potential.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Exposure & patch status**\n    - Confirm whether we run **Ivanti EPM**; validate **patch application** for the current advisory.\n    - If EPM is Internet‑facing, treat as **high‑risk**; consider temporary **access limitation (VPN only)**.\n  - **Log review**\n    - Check **EPM admin access logs** for:\n      - Logins from **unusual IPs/ASNs**.\n      - Sudden creation of **new admin accounts**, or role changes.\n    - Review **software distribution / task logs** for:\n      - Unexpected deployment jobs or scripts pushed to many endpoints.\n  - **Hunting**\n    - EDR: look for **simultaneous new agent jobs** or unusual scripts executed from Ivanti agent paths.\n    - If suspicious activity is found, **triage EPM server for webshells or modified web content**.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Fortinet: FortiCloud SSO auth‑bypass & FortiSandbox OS command injection\n- **What happened**\n  - Fortinet released fixes for **two critical authentication‑bypass vulnerabilities** affecting **FortiCloud SSO** as well as a **FortiSandbox OS command injection flaw** that allows remote code execution.\n- **Why it matters**\n  - Fortinet devices and cloud SSO are often **network edge and security control points**; compromise provides **network‑wide visibility and policy control**, and can be used as a **springboard into internal networks**.\n- **Immediate SOC actions**\n  - **Inventory & patch**\n    - Identify any **FortiCloud‑integrated Fortinet devices** and **FortiSandbox instances** in use and confirm **firmware/patch level** against the latest advisories.\n    - For any unpatched Internet‑exposed systems, raise **urgent change requests**.\n  - **Monitoring**\n    - Firewall/IDS logs:\n      - Look for **login attempts or API calls** from unusual IPs to Fortinet management interfaces.\n      - Watch for **changes to security policies, admin accounts, or logging destinations**.\n  - **Hunting**\n    - Inspect **FortiSandbox** for signs of:\n      - **Unexpected system users**, cron jobs, or outbound connections not matching known telemetry targets.\n    - If logs are shipped centrally, run anomaly detection for **new or rare outbound destinations** originating from Fortinet appliances.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Gogs 0‑day RCE (CVE-2025-8110) – Exploited in the wild\n- **What happened**\n  - Research reports an **RCE 0‑day in Gogs (self‑hosted Git service)** being actively exploited.\n-",
