  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- State-backed supply-chain compromise of Notepad++ update infrastructure and multiple dev registries (Open VSX, AI tooling) increases risk from “trusted” software channels; check developer endpoints and build systems.\n- A recently patched Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) is being actively exploited by APT28/Fancy Bear and others, alongside new PDF/Dropbox phishing; harden and monitor Office/email paths.\n- Ongoing exploitation of exposed databases (MongoDB), cloud ML/AI platforms (OpenClaw, SageMaker SDK), and remote-access products (Ivanti zero-days) underlines need to lock down internet-facing services and cloud identities.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Notepad++ update supply-chain hijack (Lotus Blossom / state-backed)**\n  - What happened: Hosting provider compromise let attackers backdoor Notepad++ update distribution for months, selectively delivering malware to users.\n  - Why it matters: Developer/admin workstations may have silently pulled trojanized updates, giving attackers a foothold in high-privilege environments.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Identify all endpoints with Notepad++ installed; flag those that updated in the last 9–12 months, especially from non-corporate mirrors.  \n    - Run targeted EDR sweeps on those endpoints using vendor IOCs and behavior patterns (new services, unusual outbound to rare domains); block any Notepad++ auto-update to internet until validated.\n\n- **Microsoft Office CVE-2026-21509 exploited by APT28 and others**\n  - What happened: Russia-linked APT28/Fancy Bear and other actors are actively exploiting a recently patched Office bug for initial access via malicious documents.\n  - Why it matters: High likelihood of phishing into our user base with weaponized Office files leading to code execution and follow-on credential theft.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm emergency patch/mitigation status for Office across endpoints; prioritize high-risk users (finance, execs, privileged IT).  \n    - In email and EDR, hunt for recent Office spawning scripting interpreters or LOLBins (wscript, powershell, cmd, mshta, regsvr32) from attachments; tighten Office macro/Protected View policies if possible.\n\n- **New phishing using PDFs and Dropbox for credential theft**\n  - What happened: Campaigns use benign-looking emails with PDFs that link to fake Dropbox login pages to harvest credentials.\n  - Why it matters: Likely to bypass basic URL filters (trusted brand, embedded in PDF) and target corporate/O365/Dropbox accounts used for data sharing.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - In email security, flag external PDFs containing embedded URLs to non-Dropbox domains or lookalike Dropbox domains; elevate to sandboxing/manual review.  \n    - In IdP logs, monitor for logins from unusual IPs/devices shortly after email delivery to users who received such PDFs; enable/verify MFA and impossible travel detections.\n\n- **Cloud/AI platform vulnerabilities and data exposure (OpenClaw RCE, 21k exposed instances; SageMaker Python SDK findings; GCP Cloud Monitoring → Cloud Run abuse; Ivanti zero-days)**\n  - What happened: Critical one-click RCE and mass misconfig in OpenClaw AI, security findings in AWS SageMaker SDK, a GCP Cloud Monitoring privilege-escalation path, and actively exploited Ivanti remote access vulnerabilities.\n  - Why it matters: Our ML/AI and remote-access/cloud-monitoring stack could be abused for code execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration, especially if internet-facing.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Coordinate with cloud/platform teams today to verify: (1) we don’t have exposed OpenClaw or similar AI agents; (2) SageMaker SDK and related components are current; (3) any GCP Cloud Monitoring Uptime Checks→Cloud Run flows align with least-privilege; (4) Ivanti appliances are patched or access-restricted; add compensating WAF/VPN controls where patching lags.\n\n- **Database and Linux/Windows malware activity (MongoDB ransom-wiping, ShadowHS fileless Linux malware, Pulsar RAT on Windows)**\n  - What happened: Attackers are wiping unsecured MongoDB instances and planting ransom notes; new fileless Linux malware (ShadowHS) spreads automatically; Pulsar RAT abuses Windows Run keys for persistence and exfiltration.\n  - Why it matters: Direct risk to any exposed DBs and internet-facing Linux/Windows servers; stealth persistence could bypass basic AV.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Immediately verify no MongoDB instances are publicly exposed without auth; check for recent DB drop/recreate activity and ransom notes.  \n    - For Linux and Windows servers, run hunts for abnormal outbound traffic from system daemons/services, new per-user Run key entries, and shells spawned from web processes; tighten SSH/RDP and patch baseline.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Office 0-day / APT28 phishing (CVE-2026-21509)**\n  - Log sources: Email gateway, EDR, Windows Event Logs, proxy/DNS.  \n  - Hunt: Office processes (WINWORD/EXCEL/POWERPNT) spawning script interpreters or LOLBins (powershell, wscript, mshta, regsvr32, rundll32) – ATT&CK T1203, T1566, T1059.\n\n- **PDF + Dropbox credential phishing**\n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, web proxy, IdP/M365 audit logs.  \n  - Hunt: PDF attachments with embedded URLs to non-Dropbox domains or typosquats; subsequent logins from new IPs/ASNs to corporate SaaS within 0–2 hours of delivery – T1566.002, T1078.\n\n- **Notepad++ / developer tooling supply-chain compromise**\n  - Log sources: EDR, endpoint software inventory, proxy/DNS logs.  \n  - Hunt: Notepad++ updater or binary making outbound connections to rare domains/IPs; newly created services, scheduled tasks, or persistence set shortly after Notepad++ update events – T1195, T1547.\n\n- **AI/dev registries and Open VSX / MoltBot / Hugging Face abuse**\n  - Log sources: Dev endpoints, CI/CD runners, artifact repositories, EDR, outbound DNS.  \n  - Hunt: Build agents pulling new or recently updated packages/extensions from public registries just before unusual outbound connections or script execution; unsigned binaries in build output – T1195.003, T1505.\n\n- **Cloud platform abuse (OpenClaw, SageMaker, GCP Cloud Monitoring → Cloud Run, non-human identities)**\n  - Log sources: AWS CloudTrail, GCP Audit Logs, IAM/IdP logs, container logs.  \n  - Hunt: Uptime Checks or monitoring service accounts invoking Cloud Run or similar workloads unexpectedly; creation of new API keys/roles for service accounts; abnormal data-transfer volumes from ML/AI workloads – T1078.004, T1098, T1610.\n\n- **MongoDB ransom-wiping & database exposure**\n  - Log sources: MongoDB logs, firewall/WAF, cloud security posture tools.  \n  - Hunt: Anonymous or unknown IPs performing full-collection deletes, mass updates, or dropping databases; spikes in DB errors followed by ransom-note collections – T1485, T1490.\n\n- **Linux ShadowHS & Windows Pulsar RAT / other RATs**\n  - Log sources: EDR on Linux/Windows, syslog, Windows registry auditing, NetFlow.  \n  - Hunt: For Linux – long-lived suspicious processes with network connections to rare external IPs and no on-disk binary; for Windows – new per-user Run entries, RAT-like processes initiating C2 (small, periodic TLS/HTTP beacons) – T1055, T1105, T1547.\n\n- **Abuse of LOLBins across environments (PeckBirdy, general post-exploitation)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, PowerShell logs, Sysmon, command-line telemetry.  \n  - Hunt: LOLBins (certutil, msiexec, bitsadmin, powershell, wmic, rundll32) used to download or execute from external URLs, temp paths, or user-writable directories – T1218, T1105.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patch and configuration review for Office, Ivanti, OpenClaw, SageMaker SDK, GCP Monitoring**\n  - Ensure these products are on latest patches; document and close any compensating controls after patching; add them to regular vulnerability scanning coverage.\n\n- **Enterprise-wide software inventory and update control for dev tools**\n  - Build/maintain an authoritative inventory of developer utilities (Notepad++, IDEs, extensions, AI coding agents) and route updates via internal repositories where possible.\n\n- **Hardening of databases and cloud data stores**\n  - Enforce mandatory authentication and network segmentation for MongoDB and other DBs; add guardrails (CSPM policies) to prevent public exposure and default credentials.\n\n- **Identity and access management for non-human identities**\n  - Review service accounts, API tokens, and monitoring agents in cloud/on-prem; enforce least-privilege, regular key rotation, and anomaly detection on their behavior.\n\n- **Email and user awareness refresh**\n  - Update phishing training to include current patterns: Office 0-day docs, PDF→Dropbox scams, AI/crypto-themed lures; rehearse reporting/escalation paths for suspicious messages.\n\n- **Linux and OT/ICS monitoring uplift**\n  - Expand EDR and logging coverage to critical Linux servers and any OT/ICS components in scope; baseline normal services and network flows to better detect wipers or destructive activity.",
