  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- Active exploitation of perimeter and collaboration tech continues: FortiWeb, legacy firewalls, and a critical Zoom for Windows flaw are all being targeted.\n- Multiple botnets and RATs (GravityRAT, RondoDox, Kimwolf, Sliver C2) are expanding via known CVEs, increasing risk of covert persistence and proxy infrastructure inside our network.\n- Data exposure and metadata leaks (Ledger/Global-e, WhatsApp) reinforce the need for stricter vendor monitoring and detection of exfiltration and abuse of “benign” app features.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Critical Zoom for Windows vulnerability actively exploited**\n  - What happened: A critical Zoom flaw affecting Windows clients is being exploited in the wild.  \n  - Why it matters: Zoom is common in financial environments; compromise of user endpoints via meetings/chat can bypass traditional email/web controls.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Verify Zoom client patch levels on corporate endpoints; flag outdated versions via EDR/software inventory.  \n    - Add detections for Zoom spawning unusual child processes, PowerShell, cmd, or script interpreters (T1204, T1059).  \n\n- **FortiWeb exploitation to deploy Sliver C2**\n  - What happened: Threat actors are exploiting FortiWeb appliances to install Sliver C2 for persistent access.  \n  - Why it matters: Financial orgs frequently use Fortinet appliances; compromise means stealthy, long-term access from our perimeter into internal networks.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm our exposure: identify any FortiWeb/Fortinet WAF assets; check patch/config status and admin access logs.  \n    - Hunt for Sliver-like C2 patterns (mutual TLS, domain fronting, long-lived low-volume beaconing) from those devices and adjacent subnets (T1071, T1090).  \n\n- **Large population of internet-facing firewalls still vulnerable to “old” CVEs**\n  - What happened: Reporting that ~10,000 firewalls remain unpatched against a long-known critical vulnerability.  \n  - Why it matters: This is a reminder that attackers are reliably exploiting old, not new, bugs at the edge; any similar exposure for us is a likely entry point.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Cross-check perimeter asset list against vendor security advisories and CISA KEV; highlight any firewalls or VPNs with outstanding critical CVEs.  \n    - Increase scrutiny of inbound/outbound traffic on those devices (unusual admin logins, config changes, new VPN users, T1133, T1190).  \n\n- **Botnets and RATs expanding via known vulnerabilities (RondoDox, Kimwolf, GravityRAT, Sliver)**\n  - What happened: New/updated botnets and RATs are exploiting web and IoT/edge CVEs to build proxy infrastructure and gain cross-platform remote access.  \n  - Why it matters: These families can turn our endpoints or exposed devices into C2 nodes or pivots into more sensitive networks, potentially supporting ransomware or data theft.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Run short hunts in EDR and proxy/DNS logs for unusual outbound connections from low-profile devices (kiosks, ATMs, appliances, test VMs).  \n    - Review any recent “generic trojan” or “backdoor” detections for overlaps with Sliver/Kimwolf/GravityRAT behaviors and escalate for deeper triage (T1105, T1571).  \n\n- **Persistent claims/breaches in vendor and SaaS ecosystems (Ledger/Global‑e breach, NordVPN Salesforce claims, WhatsApp metadata leak)**\n  - What happened: Confirmed third‑party breach affecting Ledger’s commerce provider, unconfirmed claims against NordVPN’s Salesforce environment, and a WhatsApp metadata leak being patched.  \n  - Why it matters: Reinforces risk from our vendors’ SaaS and from employees using consumer apps; also risk of look‑alike phishing using breach narratives.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Add temporary monitoring rules for spikes in phishing using “Ledger”, “NordVPN”, “Salesforce account verification”, “WhatsApp security” keywords in mail and web filters (T1566).  \n    - Review SaaS access logs (especially Salesforce/CRM and e‑commerce integrations) for anomalous logins, new API tokens, mass data exports (T1530, T1567).  \n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Zoom + collaboration exploitation**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows event logs, proxy/DNS.  \n  - Hunt for Zoom (and other meeting clients) spawning shells, scripting engines, or writing binaries to temp/Downloads (T1204, T1059).\n\n- **Perimeter appliance exploitation (FortiWeb, legacy firewalls, VPNs, Eaton/NVA appliances)**\n  - Log sources: Firewall/WAF logs, VPN logs, Azure/GCP network virtual appliance logs.  \n  - Monitor for new/unknown admin logins, config changes outside change windows, and HTTP requests to management URIs from the internet (T1190, T1133).\n\n- **C2/botnet activity (Sliver, Kimwolf, RondoDox, generic RATs)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, network sensors, proxy/DNS.  \n  - Look for: periodic low‑volume HTTPS beacons to rare domains/IPs, high failed connections, connections from atypical segments (ATMs, lab, printers) to the internet (T1071, T1105).\n\n- **Remote access trojans & stealers (GravityRAT, VVS stealer)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, email gateway, web proxy.  \n  - Monitor for suspicious archive/executable downloads from newly registered or low‑reputation domains, and processes accessing credential stores/browsers/Discord (T1555, T1552).\n\n- **Data exfiltration and metadata abuse (Ledger/Global‑e, WhatsApp)**\n  - Log sources: DLP, proxy, CASB, SaaS logs (e.g., Salesforce, file sharing).  \n  - Alert on large exports, abnormal report/API pulls, or unusual hours/countries; correlate with new device fingerprints for the same account (T1567, T1041).\n\n- **Account takeover & insider-style campaigns (Microsoft “Jasper Sleet” insider access case)**\n  - Log sources: IdP, M365/AAD, Okta, HR systems.  \n  - Detect impossible travel, sudden privilege escalations, new MFA enrollments, or access from unmanaged devices to sensitive apps (T1078, T1098).\n\n- **IoT/OT and power/UPS devices (Eaton CVEs, botnets on IoT)**\n  - Log sources: Network flows, OT monitoring, SNMP/syslog from facility/UPS devices.  \n  - Watch for new outbound connections from OT segments to the internet and any HTTP/SSH access to those devices from user subnets (T1190, T1040).\n\n- **Red‑team/dual‑use tooling (ProfileHound, GHOSTCREW, Sliver)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, AV, admin tool logs.  \n  - Flag unauthorized execution of penetration tools, scanners, or frameworks from non‑security admin accounts and from servers where they are not expected (T1587, T1087, T1046).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Perimeter and VPN patching review**\n  - Perform a full review of firewall/VPN/WAF patch levels versus CISA KEV and vendor advisories; schedule remediation for any legacy or “accepted” exposures.\n\n- **Zoom and collaboration app hardening**\n  - Coordinate with IT to enforce auto‑updates, restrict risky plug‑ins, and limit external meeting sharing for high‑risk roles; update hardening baselines.\n\n- **SaaS and third‑party risk controls**\n  - Validate logging and alerting coverage for key SaaS platforms (Salesforce, payments, CRM) and critical vendors; ensure vendor contracts include security event notification SLAs.\n\n- **Enhance C2/botnet detection**\n  - Tune and formalize anomaly‑based network detections (beaconing, rare destinations); incorporate Sliver/Kimwolf/RAT TTPs into hunting runbooks.\n\n- **Ransomware and data pipeline resilience**\n  - Review backup and restore processes for core data pipelines, AI/analytics platforms, and payment systems; test at least one recovery scenario this quarter.\n\n- **Analyst training & playbook updates**\n  - Refresh playbooks for: perimeter device compromise, SaaS account breach, and collaboration‑app exploitation; brief SOC on new red‑team/AI tool abuse patterns to reduce “tool” false negatives.",
