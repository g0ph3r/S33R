  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation and PoCs around Cloudflare access-bypass, Windows SMB/AD compromise, and Kerberos relay techniques significantly increase risk to identity and network perimeters.\n- Multiple malware delivery vectors abusing Google Ads, PDF apps, and browser extensions are being used to deploy RATs/backdoors that evade EDR and target enterprise systems.\n- Ransomware operations (including infrastructure leaks and Black Basta law-enforcement activity) highlight continued focus on credential theft, AD abuse, and third-party service providers (e.g., Ingram Micro).\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cloudflare zero-day: access control bypass to “any host globally”**  \n  - What happened: Researchers disclosed and detailed a Cloudflare zero‑day that can bypass protections and reach arbitrary internal hosts behind Cloudflare.  \n  - Why it matters: Any of our internet-facing sites, APIs, or vendor services relying on Cloudflare for access control/WAF could be reachable by attackers despite rules.  \n  - Actions (today):  \n    - Confirm with Infra/Cloud which properties use Cloudflare; request status on mitigations/temporary rules from the write‑up and from Cloudflare advisories.  \n    - Increase WAF/reverse-proxy and web server log scrutiny for unusual origin host access, new paths, or requests bypassing normal headers/IP ranges.\n\n- **Windows SMB client vulnerability enabling full Active Directory compromise (with PoC)**  \n  - What happened: A Windows SMB client bug was detailed that allows attackers to “own AD” from a client compromise, with PoC and exploitation guidance published.  \n  - Why it matters: Fits typical ransomware playbooks—lateral movement and domain dominance from a single compromised workstation/server.  \n  - Actions (today):  \n    - Prioritize hunting for suspicious SMB traffic (non-standard ports, outbound SMB to unusual subnets/hosts, SMB over internet) and anomalous use of `NTLM` over SMB.  \n    - Validate EDR coverage and detections for `lsass` access, AD tools (BloodHound, Mimikatz-like behavior), and mass authentication attempts from a single host.\n\n- **New Kerberos relay attack using DNS CNAME to bypass existing mitigations (PoC released)**  \n  - What happened: Researchers published a new Kerberos relay technique that abuses DNS CNAME records to bypass standard anti‑relay mitigations.  \n  - Why it matters: Direct threat to Windows/AD environments; could be used to escalate privileges or gain service tickets despite protections, again aligned with ransomware TTPs.  \n  - Actions (today):  \n    - Monitor DC logs for anomalous Kerberos service ticket requests (unusual SPNs, volume spikes from single clients).  \n    - Coordinate with AD team to validate enforcement of SMB signing, Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA), and to review high-value SPNs/CNAME usage.\n\n- **Malware via Google Ads & trojanized installers (EndRAT, Remcos, PDFSIDER)**  \n  - What happened: Ongoing campaigns abuse Google Ads and fake tools (PDF editors, converter apps, VeraCrypt installers, PDF24) to deliver RATs/backdoors (EndRAT, Remcos, PDFSIDER) that evade AV/EDR.  \n  - Why it matters: High chance of user-driven compromise in corporate environment, especially developers, finance staff, or admins downloading “utilities” on Windows.  \n  - Actions (today):  \n    - Tighten and monitor web proxy/EDR for downloads of unsigned installers, PDF utilities, and archives from ad‑referrer or newly registered domains; flag and review installs of new PDF/converter tools.  \n    - Run short-term hunts for new or unusual RAT-like processes, scheduled tasks, and outbound C2 from recently provisioned or high-risk endpoints.\n\n- **Malicious browser extensions targeting enterprise (CrashFix / ModeloRAT, HR/ERP extension abuse, sleeper extensions)**  \n  - What happened: Multiple reports of malicious Chrome/Edge/Firefox extensions—fake crash-fix extensions, HR/ERP-targeting extensions, and sleeper spyware extensions—used as enterprise backdoors.  \n  - Why it matters: Bypasses many controls, gives access to corporate web apps (HR, ERP, banking portals, email), and is hard for users to notice.  \n  - Actions (today):  \n    - Pull inventory of corporate-managed browser extensions from endpoint/browse management; alert on non-whitelisted or newly installed extensions, especially with broad permissions.  \n    - Enhance monitoring of unusual login locations or headless-like browser activity against HR/ERP/Banking apps (suspicious user-agents, odd times, rapid data access).\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Identity & AD abuse (SMB vuln, Kerberos relay, NTLM cracking, BloodHound discussions)**  \n  - Log sources: Windows Security logs on DCs, AD FS, EDR on domain-joined hosts, DNS logs.  \n  - Focus: T1550/T1557/T1003 – abnormal Kerberos ticket activity, unusual DC authentication spikes, LSASS access, BloodHound/PowerShell AD enumeration, anomalous DNS CNAME queries tied to auth events.\n\n- **Cloudfront/Cloudflare and web perimeter (Cloudflare zero‑day, Azure WAF React RSC CVE)**  \n  - Log sources: Cloudflare/other CDN logs, WAF, origin web server/app logs, API gateway.  \n  - Focus: T1190/T1133 – requests that bypass normal IP ranges, missing customary headers, unusual host headers, surges in 4xx/5xx followed by success, anomalous access to admin/debug endpoints.\n\n- **Malvertising & trojanized installers (Google Ads, converter/PDF tools, VeraCrypt)**  \n  - Log sources: Secure web gateway/proxy, DNS, EDR, email gateway (for link delivery), application whitelisting.  \n  - Focus: T1189/T1204/T1059 – executable/installer downloads from ad-referral chains, newly registered domains, unusual file types (EXE, MSI, ISO) from non-approved repositories, child processes of installers spawning PowerShell/cmd.\n\n- **PDFSIDER / RATs / backdoors on Windows endpoints**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Sysmon, firewall egress logs.  \n  - Focus: T1105/T1055/T1547 – suspicious DLL/EXE in PDF app directories, processes spawned by `pdf24.exe`/similar, memory-only execution patterns, persistence via Run keys or scheduled tasks, outbound C2 to rare destinations from office endpoints.\n\n- **Malicious browser extensions & credential theft to web apps**  \n  - Log sources: Browser management/MDM, IdP (SSO), SaaS audit logs (HR, ERP, email, CRM).  \n  - Focus: T1185/T1552/T1539 – new extensions with broad permissions, spikes in API calls from browser-based sessions, unusual IPs/ASNs for normal users, impossible travel, multiple parallel sessions using identical user-agent but different IPs.\n\n- **Ransomware ecosystem & third-party risk (Ingram Micro breach, Black Basta raids, leaked infra)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, VPN, RDP, file servers, backup systems, vendor access gateways.  \n  - Focus: T1486/T1078/T1021 – vendor accounts used at odd hours, lateral RDP/SMB from service accounts, rapid file renames/encryptor-like patterns, unusual access to backup repositories.\n\n- **ServiceNow / AI-integrated SaaS and Gemini calendar data exposure**  \n  - Log sources: SaaS audit logs (ServiceNow, Google Workspace), IdP logs, CASB.  \n  - Focus: T1526/T1087 – abnormal API token usage, large exports of tickets/meeting data, new AI-related integrations or apps created, service accounts accessing data outside normal patterns.\n\n- **Crypto / Web3-related threats (Ethereum dusting/address poisoning)**  \n  - Log sources: Web proxy, DNS, EDR on trading/workstation endpoints.  \n  - Focus: T1565/T1195 – user visits to phishing/“airdrop” sites, clipboard manipulation attempts, suspicious browser extensions on trading desks.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Coordinate with Infra/Cloud on Cloudflare and WAF posture**  \n  - Verify our use of Cloudflare; ensure vendor guidance is applied and that origin hardening (mTLS, allowlisting) is in roadmap.  \n  - Review WAF rules for React RSC and similar app-layer vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Accelerate AD/Windows hardening roadmap**  \n  - Enforce SMB signing and disable NTLMv1; evaluate NTLM overall reduction per Mandiant guidance.  \n  - Tighten privileged group membership, service account hygiene, and Kerberos constrained delegation; review BloodHound findings conservatively.\n\n- **Browser & extension governance**  \n  - Implement/strengthen allowlist-based extension policies for managed browsers.  \n  - Add user awareness on fake “CrashFix”, PDF editors, and ad-driven download risks; integrate into phishing/safe browsing training.\n\n- **Third-party and supply-chain risk management**  \n  - Review exposure to impacted providers (e.g., Ingram Micro-type distributors, PR/marketing, SaaS vendors with AI integrations).  \n  - Ensure vendor contracts and DDQs include requirements for timely breach notification, EDR on remote access, and MFA.\n\n- **Ransomware playbook refinement using recent leaks/Black Basta intel**  \n  - Update internal threat models and detection content with current TTPs for initial access, lateral movement, and data exfiltrations used by top-tier gangs.  \n  - Validate incident response runbooks (isolation, backups, negotiation policy) against these scenarios.\n\n- **AI and privacy risk posture**  \n  - Work with privacy/compliance to define boundaries for generative AI integrations (ServiceNow, Gemini, others).  \n  - Plan for additional monitoring and DLP controls around AI-related data flows and logs.",
