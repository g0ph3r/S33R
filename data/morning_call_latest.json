  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and related RSC/Next.js issues, with reports of ~59k servers compromised and multiple Chinese threat groups leveraging it for malware delivery.\n- Multiple actively exploited 0‑days and KEV‑listed issues (Apple iOS/macOS, Chromium, GeoServer, Sierra routers, Windows RASMAN) raise browser, mobile, and edge‑device risk for users and exposed services.\n- New and evolving ransomware families (Gentlemen, VolkLocker) plus Storm‑0249 EDR sideloading and xHunt targeting Exchange/IIS underline continued focus on initial access and defense evasion in enterprise environments.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **React2Shell / React Server Components & Next.js exploitation (CVE-2025-55182, CVE-2025-55183/4)**\n  - What happened: Critical RCE/DoS/info‑leak bugs in RSC/Next.js are being mass‑exploited; Google reports at least 5 Chinese groups, C2 breach shows ~59k compromised servers.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any public‑facing Next.js/RSC app (including customer portals, internal tools exposed via internet) may be a foothold for web‑shells, data theft, and lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Coordinate with app/platform teams to identify any React RSC/Next.js services; confirm patch status and emergency mitigation; search WAF/web logs for suspicious POSTs to RSC/Next.js routes and sudden spikes in 500/404s followed by new processes, outbound C2, or new files in app dirs.\n\n- **Apple & Chromium 0‑days under active exploitation (CVE-2025-14174, CVE-2025-43529 + related Chrome flaw)**\n  - What happened: Apple released fixes for two iOS/macOS 0‑days tied to a separately exploited Chromium 0‑day; CISA issued alert on the Chrome/Chromium issue.\n  - Why it matters operationally: High‑value users (execs, traders, admins) on iOS/macOS + Chrome‑based browsers are at risk of drive‑by compromise and spyware, which can bypass perimeter controls.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Verify via MDM/endpoint management that all managed Apple devices and Chrome/Edge browsers are on latest versions; prioritize checks for users handling payments, trading, or privileged access; review proxy/DNS/EDR for suspicious downloads/drive‑by patterns (multiple redirects, rare domains) from these users in last 7–14 days.\n\n- **CISA KEV and other actively exploited infra flaws (GeoServer, Sierra routers, Chromium)**\n  - What happened: CISA mandated urgent patching of an actively exploited GeoServer vuln; added a Sierra router vuln to KEV; highlighted ongoing exploitation of the Chromium 0‑day.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any unpatched GeoServer instance or Sierra‑based router (including at branches or vendors) can provide direct network access and pivot points around our perimeter.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Confirm inventory for GeoServer and Sierra routers; if present, check patch status and restrict public exposure; review firewall/NPS/VPN logs for abnormal inbound traffic to these devices, config changes, or new admin logins from unusual IPs, and raise tickets for any unpatched exposed instances.\n\n- **Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) arbitrary code execution flaw**\n  - What happened: A critical Windows RASMAN vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution; public write‑ups show exploitability.\n  - Why it matters operationally: RASMAN is widely present on Windows clients/servers; exploitation could give local/system‑level access and be chained with phishing or lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Confirm with endpoint team whether the relevant Microsoft patch is deployed or in rollout; in EDR, hunt for suspicious use of rasman‑adjacent binaries or unusual VPN/remote access profile changes and processes spawning from RAS‑related services on servers.\n\n- **xHunt APT targeting Microsoft Exchange and IIS with custom backdoors**\n  - What happened: xHunt is actively attacking Microsoft Exchange and IIS web servers to deploy bespoke backdoors.\n  - Why it matters operationally: On‑prem Exchange/IIS remain high‑value for email compromise and web‑shell‑based lateral movement; financial orgs are common intelligence targets.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: Verify latest patches and hardened config on any on‑prem Exchange/IIS; scan for non‑standard modules, new/modified ASPX/ASPX‑CS files, or suspicious scheduled tasks/services on these hosts; correlate Outlook/OWA login anomalies (impossible travel, legacy auth) with possible server‑side compromise.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **React2Shell / Next.js & RSC exploitation**\n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs (Nginx/IIS/Node), container/orchestrator logs, EDR on web hosts.\n  - What to watch (T1190, T1505.003): Sudden spikes in POST/GET requests to “/_next”, RSC API routes, or unusual serialized payloads; creation of new JS/TS/JSX/ASPX/Node files, or shell processes (bash, powershell, cmd) spawned by the web server user.\n\n- **Exchange/IIS & xHunt‑style web shells**\n  - Log sources: Exchange/IIS logs, Windows Event Logs, EDR, email telemetry.\n  - What to watch (T1505.003, T1059): Odd URL patterns, long/random parameter names, frequent 500/404 before 200s; w3wp.exe spawning cmd.exe/powershell.exe; anomalous Exchange management cmdlets (New‑MailboxExportRequest, Add‑MailboxPermission) from unusual admin accounts.\n\n- **Apple/Chromium 0‑day exploitation attempts**\n  - Log sources: Secure web gateways/proxy, DNS, EDR on macOS/Windows, MDM logs.\n  - What to watch (T1189, T1204): Drive‑by patterns (multi‑redirect chains, newly observed domains, “update/patch” themed URLs); macOS/iOS devices connecting to rare TLDs or domains flagged by threat intel; new persistence on macOS (LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons) shortly after browsing events.\n\n- **Network edge / routers / GeoServer**\n  - Log sources: Firewall logs, router/syslog, GeoServer app logs, NMS.\n  - What to watch (T1133, T1190): New inbound traffic from rare countries/IP ranges to GeoServer/routers; new or modified admin accounts; config changes outside maintenance windows; unexpected port forwarding/NAT rules.\n\n- **RASMAN and Windows remote access abuse**\n  - Log sources: Windows Security/System logs, EDR, VPN logs.\n  - What to watch (T1068, T1133): New VPN connections followed by privilege escalation events; rasman.exe or related services spawning non‑standard child processes; modification of RAS phonebook/config files or new TAP/TUN adapters installed silently.\n\n- **EDR sideloading / defense evasion (Storm‑0249)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Sysmon, Windows Application logs.\n  - What to watch (T1574.002, T1562): Security tooling processes loading unsigned or unusual DLLs from writable directories; rapid sequence of service restarts for EDR agents; new binaries in EDR install paths.\n\n- **Ransomware precursors (Gentlemen, VolkLocker)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, AD/IdP, file servers, data‑exfil gateways.\n  - What to watch (T1078, T1486, T1041): Sudden credential dumps, mass SMB enumeration, abnormal volume of file renames/extension changes; archive tools or rsync/rclone running on servers; large outbound data flows to cloud storage or unfamiliar hosts.\n\n- **Phishing & social engineering**\n  - Log sources: Email security, secure web gateway, proxy, IdP.\n  - What to watch (T1566, T1204): “Employment offer”, “invoice”, or “purchase notice” themed emails with links to fake login pages or document viewers; login attempts to our IdP from consumer devices/browsers immediately after such emails are delivered.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **React/Next.js/modern web stack hardening**\n  - Work with dev/platform teams to build an inventory of all React/Next.js/RSC apps; ensure patch SLAs, WAF rules (RCE payload blocking), and regular dependency scanning (SCA) are enforced.\n\n- **Comprehensive mobile and browser patch management**\n  - Review policies ensuring fast rollout of iOS/macOS and browser security updates for all staff, especially privileged users; validate telemetry coverage for mobile devices where possible.\n\n- **Perimeter and router hygiene**\n  - Conduct a focused review of all externally exposed services (GeoServer, admin interfaces, routers, VPNs); enforce MFA and IP restrictions for management planes; ensure KEV items are prioritized in patch pipelines.\n\n- **EDR and logging robustness against sideloading/disablement**\n  - Confirm secure config of EDR agents (self‑protection enabled, code‑integrity enforcement, audit for unsigned DLLs in program directories); update detection content for DLL sideloading and agent tampering scenarios.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop and playbook refresh**\n  - Incorporate new families like Gentlemen/VolkLocker and common initial‑access vectors (web app exploits, EDR abuse) into IR runbooks; rehearse decision‑making around network segmentation, backups, and communication.\n\n- **Vendor and third‑party exposure review**\n  - Check whether any critical vendors rely on affected technologies (React2Shell‑susceptible apps, GeoServer, Sierra routers, MGT Varnish, FreePBX, Plesk, pgAdmin) and request assurance on their patching and monitoring posture.",
