  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- Actively exploited RCEs in VMware vCenter, GNU InetUtils telnetd, SmarterMail, Appsmith, and web dev tools (Vite, Zimbra, etc.) are now on CISA KEV and being used in real attacks; external-facing assets are primary risk.\n- Microsoft released an emergency patch for an in-the-wild Office zero‑day used via documents and LNK-based malware campaigns, plus multiple DPRK-linked phishing campaigns using AI-generated and font-based loaders.\n- New campaigns abusing developer tooling (malicious VS Code AI extensions, Vercel-hosted phishing/RAT, npm Shai‑Hulud bypass) increase supply-chain and dev-environment risk.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Actively exploited VMware vCenter RCE (CVE-2024-37079, on CISA KEV / UpGuard / BleepingComputer)**\n  - What happened: Critical vCenter Server RCE is confirmed actively exploited in the wild.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct compromise of virtualization infrastructure = lateral movement pivot into core systems, including critical banking workloads.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm patch level for all vCenter instances; if unable, treat as incident and review last 30 days of vCenter logs for anomalous admin actions and unknown IP access.  \n    - Intensify monitoring for new VMs, snapshots, and permission changes from unusual accounts/locations.\n\n- **Office zero‑day exploited in the wild + MoonPeak LNK malware**\n  - What happened: Microsoft pushed an emergency fix for an actively exploited Office zero‑day; separate campaigns use weaponized LNK files and Office-themed lures to drop RATs/ransomware.\n  - Why it matters operationally: High likelihood of email-delivered initial access to endpoints used for payments, trading, and admin operations.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Verify emergency Office updates are deployed to high-risk user groups (finance ops, executives, IT admins) and remote endpoints; escalate missing patches.  \n    - Tighten detections for Office/Explorer spawning script interpreters (PowerShell, WScript, cmd) and block LNK attachments at secure email gateway where feasible.\n\n- **Actively exploited Internet-facing services: telnetd, SmarterMail, Appsmith, Vite/Zimbra/Prettier, NetSupport 0‑day**\n  - What happened: PoCs and active exploitation published for GNU InetUtils telnetd RCE (~800K exposed), SmarterMail, Appsmith account hijack, Vitejs, Zimbra, Prettier, and NetSupport Manager 0‑day.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct unauthenticated or low-friction remote code execution and account takeover on exposed infrastructure/SaaS and dev tools.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Run immediate external attack surface check (including vendors/hosting providers) for: telnetd, SmarterMail, Zimbra, Appsmith, NetSupport Manager gateways, Vite-exposed dev servers; if found, isolate, restrict by IP/VPN, or take offline pending patching.  \n    - Hunt in web, mail, and app logs for new admin account creation, unexpected configuration changes, or shells spawned from these services.\n\n- **Phishing and malware campaigns: DPRK KONNI, Vercel-hosted RAT, tax-themed Blackmoon, Russia-targeted Amnesia RAT/ransomware**\n  - What happened: Multiple active phishing operations using fake interviews, fonts, VS Code/AI content, Vercel hosting, and tax lures to deliver KONNI, Blackmoon, Amnesia RAT, ransomware, and other loaders.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Increased likelihood of user compromise and credential theft around phishing themes (taxes, job offers, AI tools) frequently seen in corporate environments.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Tune email security to flag links to newly registered domains, Vercel-hosted apps, and suspicious file types (LNK, ISO, JS, HTA, password-protected archives); prioritize manual triage of such alerts.  \n    - Run a focused hunt on recent email-click telemetry and EDR for new remote access tools, anomalous outbound connections, and unusual persistence mechanisms on user workstations.\n\n- **Developer & supply-chain abuse: Malicious VS Code AI extensions + npm / Git dependency bypass**\n  - What happened: Popular VS Code AI extensions (1.5M installs) steal source code; attackers can bypass npm’s new “Shai-Hulud” defenses using Git dependencies.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Risk of source code exfiltration, credential theft (tokens, keys), and insertion of backdoors into internal and customer-facing financial applications.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - With DevSecOps/dev teams, identify installed VS Code extensions in managed environments; block/alert on non-approved extensions via EDR and MDM.  \n    - Monitor CI/CD and npm usage for Git-based dependencies pulled from personal or unknown repos; flag unusual token usage or registry changes from build servers.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Office / LNK malware & zero‑day abuse (MoonPeak, Office 0‑day)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows event logs, email gateway, O365 audit.  \n  - Hunt for: `winword.exe`, `excel.exe`, `powerpnt.exe`, or `explorer.exe` spawning `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `cscript.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe` (ATT&CK T1204, T1059, T1203); abnormal creation/execution of `.lnk` from email download paths.\n\n- **vCenter and virtualization compromise**  \n  - Log sources: vCenter/vSphere logs, hypervisor logs, firewall/VPN around management networks, privileged account logs.  \n  - Hunt for: logins to vCenter from non-admin IP ranges, off-hours privileged actions, new SSO users/roles, new VMs or snapshots from unusual accounts (T1078, T1098, T1136, T1105).\n\n- **Exposed telnetd / legacy services (GNU InetUtils)**  \n  - Log sources: Network flow, firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scan output.  \n  - Hunt for: inbound telnet (TCP/23) from the internet, especially to servers that should not run telnet; anomalous interactive sessions and brute-force behavior (T1021, T1078).\n\n- **Mail, web and SaaS services: SmarterMail, Appsmith, Zimbra, Vite-based apps**  \n  - Log sources: Web server logs, mail server logs, WAF, IAM/SSO logs.  \n  - Hunt for: spikes in failed logins followed by successful ones from new IPs, unusual API calls to admin endpoints, unexpected password or API-key resets (T1110, T1190, T1078).\n\n- **Phishing & RAT delivery via Vercel/other hosting**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, web proxy/DNS, EDR, browser logs.  \n  - Hunt for: clicks to `*.vercel.app` and other free hosting domains followed by downloads of executables, archives, or script files; new processes with network connections shortly after browser activity (T1566, T1105, T1059).\n\n- **DPRK KONNI & AI-generated PowerShell backdoor**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, PowerShell logs (Module & ScriptBlock logging), DNS/proxy.  \n  - Hunt for: encoded or obfuscated PowerShell, script execution from user profile or temp paths, outbound C2-like traffic to unknown domains/IPs from developer or high-privilege workstations (T1059.001, T1086, T1105).\n\n- **Developer toolchain / VS Code / npm abuse**  \n  - Log sources: EDR on dev workstations, VS Code extension telemetry if available, proxy logs from build servers, Git/npm logs.  \n  - Hunt for: new VS Code extensions installed outside standard images, extensions spawning shells or network connections; npm installs from Git URLs not in allowlist; anomalous outbound connections from CI/CD nodes (T1195, T1552, T1041).\n\n- **Ransomware precursor behavior (Amnesia, Nova, etc.)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, AD logs, file server logs, backup platform logs.  \n  - Hunt for: new local/domain admin accounts, credential harvesting tools, mass file rename/encrypt behavior, shadow copy deletions, and backup tampering (T1486, T1078, T1489, T1490).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Prioritize patching for KEV-listed and actively exploited CVEs**  \n  - Build/refresh a prioritized patch list: vCenter, telnetd (or removal), SmarterMail, Appsmith, Vite/Zimbra/Prettier, NetSupport Manager, Oracle WebLogic HTTP (CVE-2026-21962), Hadoop, Mjobtime app vulnerabilities; ensure exposure is minimized via network controls while patching.\n\n- **Office macro/script and attachment policy hardening**  \n  - Review policies to restrict macros, block LNK/ISO/HTA attachments where business allows, and enforce Protected View + Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules across the estate.\n\n- **Developer security & extension governance**  \n  - Define an approved list of IDE extensions and registries; implement technical control (GPO/MDM/EDR) to block unapproved extensions; roll out guidance for secure npm/Git dependency management and secret handling.\n\n- **Email and web security tuning for new phishing patterns**  \n  - Update URL/domain reputation policies to treat free hosting (Vercel, similar) and AI/job/tax themes as higher-risk; integrate new phishing templates into user awareness, focusing on developers, finance, HR, and executives.\n\n- **Third-party/vendor risk review**  \n  - Confirm key vendors (cloud providers, SaaS, payment processors, service integrators) have patched relevant KEV vulnerabilities (vCenter, Zimbra/SmarterMail, Appsmith, NetSupport, etc.) and request recent security advisories/attestations.\n\n- **Enhanced logging and retention for critical infrastructure**  \n  - Ensure comprehensive logging and sufficient retention for hypervisors, mail gateways, dev platforms, and admin tools to support retro-hunts when future exploitation details/IOCs are released.",
