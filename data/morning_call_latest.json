  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- MongoDB “MongoBleed” (CVE-2025-14847) is under active exploitation worldwide; ~70k instances exposed and PoC/tools released – confirm we have no exposed or unpatched instances.  \n- Multiple infrastructure‑level exploits are live: old Fortinet 2FA bypass is still abused, Adobe ColdFusion is heavily scanned, and a zero‑day in XSpeeder networking gear is unpatched by vendor.  \n- Active supply‑chain and APT activity (EmEditor website compromise, Chinese ToneShell/rootkit, Evasive Panda DNS poisoning) require reinforced EDR/hunting and DNS/SSL inspection focus.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **MongoDB MongoBleed – CVE-2025-14847 actively exploited, tools & PoC in the wild (items 2, 9, 19, 20, 34, 37, 50, 52, 60, 62)**\n  - What happened: Critical MongoDB memory leak bug exploited in the wild; governments and vendors issued alerts; detector tools and PoCs publicly released.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any exposed MongoDB (on‑prem or cloud IaaS) could leak sensitive data or be a stepping stone into our environment.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: 1) Ask infra/db owners to confirm inventory of MongoDB and patch/mitigation status; 2) Search firewall/WAF and cloud logs for direct access to MongoDB ports (default 27017/27018) from the internet and anomalous spikes since 23 Dec; 3) Add temporary high‑sensitivity alerts for external connections to MongoDB from non‑approved sources.\n\n- **Fortinet FortiOS 2FA bypass (5‑year‑old vuln still exploited) (items 36, 44, 42)**\n  - What happened: Fortinet warns that an old FortiOS/FortiProxy auth vulnerability enabling 2FA bypass continues to be actively exploited; CISA added a Fortinet issue to KEV.\n  - Why it matters operationally: If any legacy/edge Fortinet gear is in use (own or vendors/partners), it can give attackers direct VPN/admin access despite MFA.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: 1) Confirm with network/security ops whether any FortiOS/FortiProxy versions in KEV are present and unpatched; 2) Hunt VPN logs for impossible travel, unusual source countries, and successful logins without expected 2FA patterns to admin/VIP accounts; 3) Increase scrutiny of new VPN device fingerprints and admin logins.\n\n- **Adobe ColdFusion mass exploitation (items 21, 35)**\n  - What happened: >2.5M malicious requests observed targeting known ColdFusion vulnerabilities; broad internet‑scale scanning underway.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any exposed ColdFusion‑backed application (including third‑party services we depend on) could be a webshell or data exfil vector.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: 1) Validate whether we host any ColdFusion applications and if so, confirm they are patched/behind WAF; 2) Review WAF/web server logs for suspicious ColdFusion paths, RCE payloads, or spikes in 404/500 responses; 3) Enable or tighten WAF rules for CF‑related exploit signatures.\n\n- **XSpeeder networking device zero‑day RCE, vendor reportedly unresponsive (items 38, 39)**\n  - What happened: Critical remote code execution zero‑day in widely‑deployed XSpeeder networking devices exposed >70k hosts; no vendor fix yet.\n  - Why it matters operationally: If any such devices are in our perimeter or used by critical third parties, they are effectively open to takeover.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: 1) Ask network team to confirm whether any XSpeeder gear is in use (branch, ISP‑provided, or partner‑managed); 2) If present, insist on compensating controls (isolation, strict ACLs, VPN‑only management) and enhanced monitoring for config changes and anomalous inbound connections.\n\n- **Supply‑chain & APT activity – EmEditor compromise, Chinese ToneShell/rootkit, Evasive Panda DNS poisoning (items 1, 5, 43, 59)**\n  - What happened: EmEditor website used to deliver infostealers; Chinese state actors deploying a rootkit to hide ToneShell malware; Evasive Panda APT poisoning DNS to install MgBot backdoor.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Shows active use of legitimate software/update channels, DNS tampering, and stealth persistence that could bypass basic controls.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today: 1) Query EDR for EmEditor installations and recent installer executions; investigate any new installs/updates in last 30 days; 2) Review DNS logs for suspicious responses from non‑corporate resolvers and sudden resolver changes on endpoints; 3) Prioritize kernel‑mode/rootkit detection telemetry in EDR and investigate anomalous unsigned drivers or tampering with security tools.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **MongoDB/MongoBleed exposure**\n  - Log sources: Perimeter firewalls, cloud security groups, host firewalls, MongoDB logs.\n  - Hunt: New or unusual external IPs accessing MongoDB ports; authentication failures or unusual admin actions (T1078, T1021).\n\n- **VPN / Fortinet exploitation attempts**\n  - Log sources: VPN appliance logs, RADIUS/IdP, syslog from edge firewalls.\n  - Hunt: Logins without corresponding MFA events, unknown user agents, logins from atypical geos, rapid account enumeration or failed‑then‑success patterns (T1078, T1110).\n\n- **Web RCE (ColdFusion, React2Shell, other web stacks)**\n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs, application logs, EDR on web servers.\n  - Hunt: High rate of POSTs to CF or API endpoints, requests with serialized objects/OGNL/EL expressions, command‑injection strings (`;`, `&&`, `powershell`, `bash`) and sudden new processes spawned by web server user (T1190, T1059).\n\n- **Network devices / XSpeeder‑like appliances**\n  - Log sources: Network device syslog, NetFlow, firewall logs.\n  - Hunt: Management interface access from the internet, new admin accounts, config changes outside change windows, outbound connections from appliances to unfamiliar IPs (T1190, T1071).\n\n- **APT/rootkit/DNS poisoning (ToneShell, Evasive Panda)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, DNS logs, domain controllers, proxy.\n  - Hunt: Unsigned or newly installed kernel drivers; tampering with AV/EDR processes; endpoints switching to non‑corporate DNS; DNS responses from unexpected resolvers; unusual DNS queries preceding C2‑like HTTPS traffic (T1547.006, T1562, T1565, T1071).\n\n- **Email & phishing – Silver Fox and other lures (item 57)**\n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, mail server logs, proxy, endpoint browsers.\n  - Hunt: Phishing campaigns impersonating tax/financial authorities; links to credential harvesting pages; browser processes spawning script interpreters or Office opening from email with macro‑like behaviour (T1566.002, T1204).\n\n- **Windows LPE / kernel‑driver abuse (items 47, 64, 17)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Security/System logs, Sysmon if present.\n  - Hunt: Drivers loading from non‑standard paths, new services or scheduled tasks created by non‑admin processes, token manipulation, and privilege escalation chains following browser/email compromise (T1068, T1543, T1055).\n\n- **Third‑party breaches impacting financial clients (Marquis Software, law firm, Conde Nast, Coupang, Goldman Sachs items 13, 27, 28, 33, 40, 41, 53)**\n  - Log sources: IdP, VPN, CASB, email, DLP.\n  - Hunt: Credential‑stuffing patterns against our portals, spikes in password reset attempts, unusual logins from IPs associated with these breaches if available (T1110, T1078).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive exposed‑service review**\n  - Validate that business‑critical databases (MongoDB, SQL, others) and admin interfaces are not directly internet‑exposed; enforce strict network segmentation and MFA for all remote admin access.\n\n- **Legacy edge device risk program**\n  - Work with network/architecture teams to inventory and risk‑rank all edge appliances (Fortinet, XSpeeder, VPNs, load balancers); plan accelerated patching or replacement of models repeatedly targeted in KEV.\n\n- **Web app and ColdFusion hardening**\n  - Ensure WAF coverage and standard security baselines for any ColdFusion or legacy web frameworks; establish a recurring review of vendor advisories for these stacks.\n\n- **Supply‑chain and software provenance controls**\n  - Tighten controls on where installers/updates may be downloaded from (code‑signing validation, allow‑listed repositories); coordinate with dev/IT to adopt package‑integrity checks for npm and similar ecosystems.\n\n- **DNS and egress control strategy**\n  - Move toward centralized, logged, and filtered DNS resolvers for all endpoints and servers; standardize egress filtering to prevent arbitrary outbound C2 channels.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop and negotiation playbook refresh**\n  - In light of ongoing ransomware incidents (energy sector, Marquis), revisit our ransomware runbook, offline backups, and decision process for extortion scenarios involving our data or key third parties.",
