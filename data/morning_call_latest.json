  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active, large-scale exploitation of React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑55182) in Next.js/React Server Components is delivering multiple malware families (PCPcat, ZnDoor) with tens of thousands of servers compromised.\n- Multiple actively exploited vulnerabilities in Apple products and several new KEV‑listed issues (Apple, Gladinet/Triofox, GeoServer, Sierra routers) require expedited patch review, especially for remote-access and web-exposed services.\n- New and ongoing threat activity (Makop & “Gentlemen” ransomware, xHunt APT on Exchange/IIS, AWS report on npm supply chain campaigns) reinforces need to tighten email/web filtering, supply‑chain monitoring, and privilege escalation detection.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑55182) & related RSC vulns with mass exploitation (PCPcat, ZnDoor, 59k Next.js servers)**\n  - What happened: Critical RCE in React Server Components / Next.js is being mass-exploited by multiple groups and malware families; 59k+ servers reportedly compromised in ~48h, with fake “GitHub scanners” that are actually malware.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Any Internet-facing app using React RSC/Next.js in our stack or vendors’ stacks could be a foothold for full compromise, webshells, and data theft.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Coordinate with app/platform teams to (1) positively identify any RSC/Next.js use and confirm patch status/workarounds; (2) hunt in web/app logs for anomalous POSTs to RSC endpoints and sudden file writes/spawned shells; (3) block known malicious “React2Shell scanner” repos/tools if seen; (4) raise priority on any alerts from web front-ends and related app servers.\n\n- **Apple zero‑days (CVE‑2025‑14174, CVE‑2025‑43529) – actively exploited, on CISA KEV**\n  - What happened: Apple released updates for iOS/iPadOS/macOS for two actively exploited bugs, now added by CISA to KEV; linked to a separate exploited Chrome-related flaw.\n  - Why it matters operationally: At‑risk mobile endpoints (execs, traders, remote staff) and unmanaged BYOD may be already compromised and used as entry or exfiltration channels.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Confirm MDM is enforcing latest iOS/iPadOS/macOS versions for all managed devices; flag non‑compliant as high risk in access control; monitor mobile device VPN/IdP sign‑ins for anomalies; brief helpdesk to triage users with unexpected prompts, crashes, or browser redirections on Apple devices.\n\n- **New KEV items & Internet‑facing service vulns (GeoServer, Sierra routers, Gladinet CentreStack/Triofox, FreePBX, Plesk, pgAdmin)**\n  - What happened: CISA added multiple actively exploited issues (Apple, Sierra router, Gladinet) and several vendors pushed patches for high‑severity RCE/LPE in Internet‑facing or admin tools (GeoServer, FreePBX auth bypass + SQLi + file upload, Plesk root escalation, pgAdmin RCE).\n  - Why it matters operationally: Unpatched instances (on‑prem or in third‑party providers) are prime initial access paths; exploitation is already in the wild.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: With infra team, run quick CMDB/scan check for these product names and versions on perimeter and management networks; if any exposed, raise to incident/urgent patch level and increase monitoring of associated hosts and inbound traffic; verify critical vendors (hosting, MSPs, GIS, comms) have patched where they host our data.\n\n- **Ransomware activity: Makop, “Gentlemen” ransomware, Storm‑0249 EDR abuse**\n  - What happened: Makop campaigns using GuLoader and privilege escalation; new “Gentlemen” ransomware targeting corporate networks with exfil + encryption; Storm‑0249 abusing DLL sideloading in EDR processes to hide activity.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Techniques overlap with what we see in financial‑sector intrusions—email‑borne loaders, lateral movement, EDR evasion, double‑extortion.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Tighten review of loader/droppers (GuLoader‑like) and LOLBins in EDR; prioritize alerts about unexpected service installations, LSASS access, and EDR process anomalies; verify EDR integrity checks are enabled and not suppressed; highlight to L1 that suspicious “backup,” “sync,” or “update” tools on servers should be escalated.\n\n- **xHunt APT targeting Exchange & IIS to deploy custom backdoors**\n  - What happened: xHunt is reported exploiting Microsoft Exchange and IIS servers to drop bespoke backdoors.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Exchange/IIS remain high‑value targets in finance; compromise can yield email, credentials, and internal pivot.\n  - Recommended immediate actions: Confirm all Exchange/IIS instances are fully patched and not Internet‑exposed beyond design; hunt on those servers for unusual w3wp.exe children, new modules/virtual directories, and suspicious .aspx/.ashx files; review outbound connections from these servers to unknown IPs/domains and escalate any anomalies for rapid IR.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **React2Shell / Next.js exploitation (CVE‑2025‑55182/3/4)**\n  - Logs: Web server (NGINX/IIS/Apache), WAF, app logs, containers.\n  - Focus: Unusual POSTs/GETs to RSC/Next.js API or _next/ paths; spikes in 500 errors; web server spawning shells (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, /bin/sh); new files in app directories.  \n  - MITRE: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing App), T1059 (Command Shell).\n\n- **Malware delivery via loaders (GuLoader, PCPcat, ZnDoor, npm campaigns)**\n  - Logs: EDR, web proxy, email security, DNS, endpoint application install logs.\n  - Focus: Scripted downloads from file‑sharing/paste sites or unusual GitHub repos; compressed archives launching scripts; unsigned binaries launched from user profile or temp; persistence via Run keys, scheduled tasks.  \n  - MITRE: T1204, T1105, T1053, T1060/T1547.\n\n- **Ransomware and EDR sideloading (Storm‑0249, Makop, Gentlemen)**\n  - Logs: EDR, Windows Event Logs (Sysmon if deployed), application logs.\n  - Focus: DLL sideloading patterns (trusted EXEs loading unexpected DLLs from writable dirs), tampering with AV/EDR services, mass file access/encryption behavior, shadow copy deletion (vssadmin, wmic), abnormal backup deletion.  \n  - MITRE: T1574.002 (DLL Search Order Hijack), T1486, T1562 (Defense Evasion).\n\n- **Exchange / IIS backdoors (xHunt)**\n  - Logs: IIS logs, Exchange logs, EDR on servers, firewall.\n  - Focus: Rare user agents or odd URLs hitting Exchange/IIS; unusual outbound traffic from these servers; w3wp.exe spawning cmd/PowerShell; new/modified webshell‑like files within inetpub/ or OWA/ECP paths.  \n  - MITRE: T1505.003 (Web Shell), T1105.\n\n- **Apple / mobile compromise**\n  - Logs: MDM, VPN, IdP (Okta/AAD/etc.), email access logs.\n  - Focus: New mobile devices registering unexpectedly to high‑privilege accounts; logins from impossible travel locations tied to iOS/macOS; repeated MFA prompts or push fatigue signs; devices stuck on old OS versions.  \n  - MITRE: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1114 (Email Collection).\n\n- **KEV / edge devices and routers (Sierra routers, remote‑assist, Plesk, GeoServer)**\n  - Logs: Firewall, VPN, router logs, jump hosts, admin portals.\n  - Focus: Management interfaces accessed from the Internet or unfamiliar IPs; new admin users, config changes out of hours; unexpected outbound connections from network gear or management servers.  \n  - MITRE: T1190, T1090 (Proxy), T1078.\n\n- **npm / supply‑chain campaigns (per AWS report)**\n  - Logs: Developer endpoints (EDR), CI/CD logs, artifact registries, outbound web/DNS.\n  - Focus: npm installs of new or rarely used packages, especially typo‑squats; packages executed in build agents with network calls to unknown domains; scripts spawning shells or downloading payloads during builds.  \n  - MITRE: T1195 (Supply Chain), T1127 (Trusted Developer Utilities).\n\n- **Phishing & social engineering (Frogblight Android malware, Clickfix/finger.exe abuse, PayPal email issues)**\n  - Logs: Email security, secure web gateway, EDR.\n  - Focus: Messages purporting to be government portals, delivery services, or payment confirmations; links leading to APK downloads; finger.exe or other legacy tools invoked via Office or browser; users reporting odd PayPal or banking purchase notices.  \n  - MITRE: T1566 (Phishing), T1204.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **React/Next.js security posture**\n  - Inventory all internal and third‑party apps using React RSC/Next.js; ensure patch strategy, WAF rules, and secure coding guidelines are updated; include React2Shell checks in regular web app assessments.\n\n- **KEV alignment and patch governance**\n  - Cross‑check current KEV list (Apple, Sierra, Gladinet, GeoServer, etc.) against asset inventory; formalize a fast‑track process for KEV items affecting Internet‑facing or high‑privilege systems.\n\n- **Email/mobile security awareness**\n  - Update user training materials with examples of current scams (government‑spoofing APKs, fake employment scams, purchase notice fraud); emphasize verification for financial or credential‑related requests.\n\n- **Supply‑chain / dev environment hardening**\n  - With DevOps, enforce lockfiles, internal registries, and package allow‑lists for npm and other ecosystems; implement code signing and integrity checks for build artifacts; log and monitor all package downloads from public registries.\n\n- **EDR & logging coverage review**\n  - Validate that EDR is fully deployed and logging on Exchange/IIS, web front‑ends, and admin jump hosts; ensure Sysmon/advanced logging is enabled where allowed to better detect sideloading and ransomware precursors.\n\n- **Third‑party and vendor risk**\n  - Engage key service providers (cloud, comms, payment processors, GIS, hosting) for written assurance on recent critical vulnerabilities (React2Shell exposure, FreePBX/Plesk/GeoServer patches, Apple device hygiene of their operators).",
