  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active phishing and malware campaigns (LinkedIn DLL sideloading, PDFSider, Gootloader, regional spear‑phishing) are targeting enterprises and finance specifically, using low‑detection payloads and EDR evasion.\n- Multiple cloud/AI and infrastructure vulnerabilities (Anthropic MCP Git server, Chainlit, Azure Private Endpoints DoS, Java TLS AIA SSRF/DoS, Oracle CPU, TP‑Link VIGI/other TP‑Link flaws, ICS advisories) raise exposure across web, AI and OT/IoT surfaces.\n- Ransomware groups (Everest, NightSpire, RansomHub) continue to hit large brands and suppliers, underscoring the importance of initial access monitoring, third‑party risk, and rapid containment.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **LinkedIn phishing → DLL sideloading → RAT (enterprise exec targeting)**  \n  - What happened: Campaign abuses LinkedIn messages to deliver trojanized installers leveraging DLL sideloading for RAT deployment and potential ransomware staging.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Likely to bypass email filters (uses LinkedIn messaging, not mail) and abuse legitimate tools/loads, hitting high‑value users (execs, sales, recruiters).  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Enable/harden logging and alerting on new DLL loads by signed apps (Office, Teams, browsers, common enterprise tools) from user‑writable paths (T1574.002).  \n    - Add detections for processes spawned by LinkedIn‑delivered installers (browser → temp folder EXE → suspicious child processes like powershell/cmd, C2 beacons).  \n    - Brief helpdesk to escalate any “LinkedIn file” or “job/meeting invite installer” suspicion from staff.\n\n- **PDFSider & Gootloader: low‑detection loaders used by ransomware groups (finance targeted)**  \n  - What happened: New PDFSider malware (DLL sideloading, AV/EDR evasion) and updated Gootloader variants show low AV/EDR detection and are linked to ransomware operators and finance‑sector targeting.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: These families are often first‑stage loaders preceding hands‑on‑keyboard activity, AD recon and data exfil; detection gaps increase risk of late discovery.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Prioritize hunts for suspicious PDF‑related processes spawning script interpreters (wscript/cscript, powershell, rundll32, regsvr32) and unusual DLL loading paths on endpoints (EDR telemetry).  \n    - Tighten detections around new scheduled tasks/services created shortly after document opens or archive extraction (T1053, T1543).  \n    - Validate that high‑risk groups (treasury, trading, finance operations) are under stricter EDR policies and not in “monitor only” mode.\n\n- **Cloud & AI framework vulnerabilities (Anthropic Git MCP, Chainlit, Gemini prompt injection, Microsoft/Anthropic MCP RCE)**  \n  - What happened: Multiple vulnerabilities in Anthropic MCP Git server and Chainlit AI dev framework plus Gemini prompt‑injection issues enable file access, RCE and potential cloud takeover; vendors have released fixes.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Any internal use of these components as automation/orchestration backends or dev tools could be leveraged to pivot into our cloud tenants or source code.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Confirm with DevOps/AI teams TODAY whether Anthropic MCP Git server, Chainlit, or related MCP services are deployed; if yes, verify patch levels and internet exposure; restrict access via firewall/WAF immediately if unknown.  \n    - Increase monitoring on AI/dev infra: identity events (abnormal logins), cloud logs for unusual service principals, and repo activity (sudden token/secret access, mass clone, new webhooks).\n\n- **Azure Private Endpoint DNS DoS (“DNS overDoS”)**  \n  - What happened: Research highlights that certain Azure Private Endpoint deployments can be abused for DoS via DNS amplification/misconfiguration, potentially impacting internal/private services.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Misconfigured private endpoints or DNS forwarding rules could allow an attacker or misbehaving host to degrade availability of critical internal apps exposed via Azure PEs.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - Coordinate with cloud team to identify critical banking workloads using Azure Private Endpoints; monitor for high DNS query rates or anomalies from those subnets/log analytics (T1498).  \n    - Add temporary thresholds/alerts for spikes in DNS traffic to private zones/endpoints; ensure NSGs/firewalls block unnecessary external access paths to PE‑attached services.\n\n- **Java TLS AIA SSRF/DoS vulnerability (new Tenable research) + Oracle January CPU**  \n  - What happened: Tenable disclosed an SSRF/DoS issue in Java TLS AIA handling; Oracle CPU fixes 158 CVEs, including remotely exploitable issues in widely used components.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Any internet‑exposed Java‑based service or Oracle product could be targeted for availability attacks or footholds; exploitation is plausible once PoC spreads.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions:  \n    - With infra/app teams, identify externally exposed Java TLS services (Java‑based gateways, APIs, app servers) and Oracle systems; flag those for accelerated patching and stricter WAF/rate‑limiting.  \n    - Add monitoring for sudden spikes in failed TLS handshakes and anomalous outbound connections from Java processes during handshake (SSRF indicators), and ensure we log these at perimeter and host.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Social engineering & LinkedIn/phishing campaigns (LinkedIn DLL sideloading, Argentine court lure, Ledger‑style phishing)**  \n  - Email/security gateway & proxy logs, LinkedIn traffic where visible, EDR on browsers and Office; hunt for downloads of EXEs/ZIPs immediately preceded by LinkedIn or “legal notice” themed content (T1566.002, T1204).\n\n- **DLL sideloading & loader activity (LinkedIn RAT, PDFSider, Gootloader)**  \n  - EDR: alert on signed binaries loading DLLs from user/profile/temp paths, especially when followed by network connections to rare domains/IPs (T1574.002, T1105); watch rundll32/regsvr32 with non‑system DLL paths.\n\n- **Ransomware staging from loaders (PDFSider/Gootloader link to ransomware)**  \n  - EDR & AD logs: mass enumeration (net.exe, nltest, PowerShell AD modules), sudden creation of local admins, new service accounts, or mass share access (T1069, T1087, T1135); set low thresholds for lateral tool use from newly infected hosts.\n\n- **Cloud AI/dev infra abuse (Anthropic MCP, Chainlit, Gemini)**  \n  - Cloud logs (GCP/Azure/AWS), dev platform logs (Git, CI/CD): monitor for new/modified MCP endpoints, unusual service principal usage, or newly created API tokens; detect outbound connections from AI services to unexpected destinations (T1190, T1552).\n\n- **Java TLS & web app probing (Java AIA SSRF/DoS, WordPress/ACF, Airflow, AI frameworks)**  \n  - WAF, reverse proxy, and app logs: look for spikes in malformed TLS handshakes, unusual AIA/OCSP traffic, or mass requests to plugin/framework endpoints; tune rate‑limiting and identify IPs causing frequent 4xx/5xx during handshakes (T1498).\n\n- **IoT/Camera/OT devices (TP‑Link VIGI, TP‑Link password‑recovery flaw, ICS advisories for Schneider/Rockwell/Delta)**  \n  - Network & device logs: monitor for admin logins from unusual IPs and config changes on cameras/ICS gear; alert on outbound connections from these devices to internet (T1190, T1489).\n\n- **WSL2 and PowerShell abuse (WSL2 covert compromise, PowerShell.Exposed)**  \n  - EDR & Windows event logs: enable and monitor PowerShell Script Block Logging and WSL event visibility; hunt for creation of WSL binaries or scripts followed by lateral movement or credential access (T1059.001, T1059.004, T1569).\n\n- **Browser extension / fake extension attacks (CrashFix/ModelRAT)**  \n  - Proxy and endpoint logs: detect installation of non‑approved browser extensions and sudden connections to new CDNs/domains from browsers after crash events; compare against baseline allowed extensions list (T1176).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patch and exposure review for AI/dev tools and cloud components**  \n  - Inventory internal use of Anthropic MCP, Chainlit, Gemini integrations, and similar frameworks; ensure current versions, minimal privileges, network segmentation, and secure secret handling.\n\n- **Comprehensive Java & Oracle patch program**  \n  - Plan phased updates for Java runtimes, Java‑based gateways, and Oracle products prioritizing internet‑facing and critical banking services; incorporate SSRF/DoS protections into web architecture standards.\n\n- **Ransomware readiness and loader‑focused playbooks**  \n  - Update incident runbooks to explicitly cover loader‑first intrusions (PDFSider, Gootloader): early containment criteria, memory forensics, and data theft assessment; test EDR response for finance‑critical endpoints.\n\n- **Third‑party and supply‑chain risk (Luxshare, Hyatt, McDonald’s, Ledger third‑party leak)**  \n  - Review risk posture and monitoring for key vendors and SaaS providers; ensure we have contact paths, security questionnaires, and log/alert sharing where possible; confirm our customer notification and takedown processes around third‑party breaches.\n\n- **OT/IoT hardening (TP‑Link, Schneider, Rockwell, Delta ICS advisories)**  \n  - With facilities/OT, review deployment of cameras and ICS devices; schedule firmware/patch updates, enforce strong auth, disable remote access where not required, and ensure these networks are segmented from core banking systems.\n\n- **Awareness campaigns on social engineering and professional‑network lures**  \n  - Integrate LinkedIn/job‑offer style phishing and “legal/court notice” lures into next awareness wave and phishing simulations, focusing on executives, HR, legal, and front‑office staff.",
