  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- Active exploitation and PoCs for several critical RCEs (Veeam Backup, n8n workflow platform, jsPDF, D‑Link/TOTOLINK routers) raise risk of backup compromise, initial access and lateral movement.\n- Surge in advanced phishing leveraging email-routing misconfigurations and cloud services (Google Cloud abusing M365, internal-domain spoofing) increases likelihood of credential theft and business email compromise.\n- Ransomware ecosystem continues to evolve (LockBit 5.0, CrazyHunter, SEO poisoning and malvertising loaders), emphasizing need for hardened entry points and fast lateral-movement detection.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Veeam Backup & Replication critical RCE (CVSS ~9.0)**\n  - What happened: Multiple reports of critical Veeam backup vulnerabilities enabling RCE as root/admin on backup servers; patches released.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Backup servers are high-value targets for ransomware (encryption/tampering of backups, credential theft, lateral movement).\n  - Recommended immediate actions: \n    - Identify all Veeam instances (on-prem, virtual, cloud) and confirm patch level; raise any unpatched to HIGH priority ticket.\n    - Hunt last 30 days: anomalous logins to Veeam console, new/modified backup jobs or repositories, unexpected remote connections to Veeam servers.\n\n- **n8n “Ni8mare” CVSS 10.0 RCE (self-hosted & cloud)**\n  - What happened: Critical unauthenticated RCE in n8n workflow/AI automation platform (CVE-2026-21858, PoC widely circulated).\n  - Why it matters operationally: If we or vendors use n8n, compromise can give direct access to APIs, credentials, and business workflows (potential data exfil and transaction manipulation).\n  - Recommended immediate actions:\n    - Confirm with infra/app teams whether n8n is used (on-prem, containers, SaaS) and ensure emergency patching or temporary network isolation.\n    - If present, review n8n logs for new/unknown users, unexpected webhook activity, or arbitrary command execution patterns over last 14 days.\n\n- **Phishing via misconfigured email routing & internal domain spoofing**\n  - What happened: Microsoft and others report active campaigns abusing complex routing/misconfig to spoof internal domains and O365 tenants; internal-looking phishing.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Increases risk of high-trust phishing (appearing from “inside”), MFA fatigue, credential theft, and payment fraud.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:\n    - Tighten monitoring on email gateway/O365: flag messages with our domain in From: but external sending infrastructure; prioritize user reports of “internal” phishing.\n    - Run quick config check with email admins: SPF/DMARC/DKIM alignment, external relay rules, and third‑party routing paths; raise misconfig findings as P1 to messaging team.\n\n- **Backup, DLP & security tooling vulnerabilities (Veeam, Forcepoint DLP, Trend Micro Apex Central)**\n  - What happened: New advisories for Forcepoint DLP RCE/memory manipulation and multiple Trend Micro Apex Central flaws; these join Veeam as high-value security-tool targets.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Compromise of security/backup tools can blind monitoring, leak sensitive data, or be used to push malware across the estate.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:\n    - Confirm versions and patch status for Forcepoint DLP, Apex Central, and similar core security tools; escalate unpatched as HIGH.\n    - Hunt for unusual admin actions from these consoles (new policies, agents pushed, disabled rules) over last 30 days.\n\n- **Router/edge device exploits (legacy D‑Link DSL & TOTOLINK EX200, USB/consumer gear)**\n  - What happened: Active exploitation of command-injection/critical RCE flaws in discontinued D‑Link routers and serious TOTOLINK EX200 extender flaw.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Risk for small branches, third-party partners, and home offices used by VIPs; footholds for man‑in‑the‑middle or VPN credential capture.\n  - Recommended immediate actions:\n    - Work with network team to validate that unsupported D‑Link/TOTOLINK gear is not present in corporate or branch networks; if found, isolate and plan immediate replacement.\n    - For remote users, emphasize use of corporate VPN with device posture checks; flag inbound VPN connections from IPs associated with legacy SOHO devices for review.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Backup infrastructure (Veeam & other backup suites)**\n  - Log sources: Backup server logs, Windows/Linux security logs, admin consoles, network logs.\n  - Monitor for: New/modified backup jobs or repositories, changes to encryption settings, new admin accounts, unexpected outbound connections from backup servers (ATT&CK T1485/T1490/T1071).\n\n- **Workflow/automation platforms (n8n, Open WebUI, others)**\n  - Log sources: Container/orchestration logs (K8s, Docker), reverse proxies/WAFs, application logs.\n  - Monitor for: Requests to uncommon endpoints, high volume of failed/odd webhooks, commands executed via workflow “exec” nodes; treat as potential initial access (T1190) and execution (T1059).\n\n- **Phishing & email routing abuse**\n  - Log sources: Email gateway, O365/M365 audit logs, DMARC reports, IdP logs.\n  - Monitor for: Emails claiming to be from our domains but failing SPF/DKIM/DMARC, messages routed via unusual connectors or third-party routes, sign‑ins from new IPs/devices shortly after such emails (T1566.002, T1078).\n\n- **Cloud-based credential theft (Google Cloud abused to phish M365 creds)**\n  - Log sources: Email, web proxy/secure web gateway, CASB, IdP (Azure AD/Entra).\n  - Monitor for: OAuth consent to unknown apps, MFA prompts following visits to Google-hosted login pages, failed logins from Google Cloud IP ranges, password-spray-like patterns (T1110, T1556).\n\n- **SEO poisoning & malvertising loaders (BlackCat SEO, pkr_mtsi, fake Notepad++ sites)**\n  - Log sources: Web proxy/DNS, EDR, browser extension logs where available.\n  - Monitor for: Downloads of installers from non-official domains for popular tools, unsigned binaries launched from Downloads/Temp, child processes from browsers spawning script interpreters (T1189, T1204, T1105).\n\n- **Advanced ransomware families (LockBit 5.0, CrazyHunter, SafePay)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, AD logs, SMB/file server logs, backup logs.\n  - Monitor for: Mass file modifications and renames, bulk shadow copy deletions, use of known LOLBins for encryption, abnormal lateral movement using admin tools (PsExec/WMI/RDP) (T1021, T1486, T1490).\n\n- **IoT / camera and Android botnets (VStarcam backdoors, Kimwolf botnet)**\n  - Log sources: Network/IDS, firewall, DHCP, NAC.\n  - Monitor for: Unrecognized devices beaconing outbound on non-standard ports, sudden spikes in outbound traffic from cameras/IoT, Android devices communicating via residential proxy networks (T1071, T1090).\n\n- **Exchange/Email server exploitation (ToddyCat via ProxyLogon)**\n  - Log sources: Exchange/OWA logs, EDR on mail servers, IIS logs.\n  - Monitor for: Web shell patterns in Exchange paths, abnormal PowerShell/Command Shell spawned by IIS/Exchange processes, anomalous mailbox access (T1190, T1505.003, T1059).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive backup and restore hardening**\n  - Review architecture of backup/replication, ensure network segmentation, least-privilege service accounts, MFA on consoles, and regular restoration tests with ransomware scenarios.\n\n- **Email and domain security posture review**\n  - Full review of SPF/DMARC/DKIM, routing connectors, and third‑party relay rules; document and regularly audit to prevent internal-domain spoofing.\n\n- **Security tooling lifecycle management**\n  - Inventory all DLP, EDR, SIEM, backup, and management consoles; implement a process to track vendor advisories and enforce time-bound patch SLAs.\n\n- **Ransomware playbook update & exercises**\n  - Incorporate LockBit 5.0/CrazyHunter TTPs into IR runbooks; run at least one tabletop or technical exercise focusing on backup compromise and email-based initial access.\n\n- **Third-party and remote-user risk review**\n  - Ensure contracts/requirements for partners and small branches prohibit outdated SOHO equipment and mandate minimum security baselines; update VIP remote-working guidance.\n\n- **AI/LLM and shadow AI data leakage**\n  - Coordinate with risk/compliance to define policy on use of personal LLM accounts and AI tools; plan DLP rules/tuning to detect uploads of sensitive financial data to external AI services.",
