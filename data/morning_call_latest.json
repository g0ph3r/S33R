  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Actively exploited Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) pre-auth RCE zero-days (CVE-2026-1281, CVE-2026-1340) with public exploit details and CISA KEV listing – treat as ongoing perimeter compromise risk.  \n- OpenSSL released patches for 12 vulnerabilities including a high-severity RCE; potential broad impact on internet-facing and internal crypto-dependent services.  \n- Multiple campaigns abusing widely used platforms (Hugging Face infra, Magento e‑commerce, education-themed malicious domains, IIS/TAMECAT backdoors) underline rising risk from third-party/SaaS and web app exposure.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) actively exploited pre-auth RCEs (CVE-2026-1281, CVE-2026-1340)**  \n  - What happened: Multiple vendors, CISA, and researchers report in-the-wild exploitation of critical pre-auth RCE bugs in Ivanti EPMM, with PoC and exploit write-ups released.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: High-likelihood path to full device/controller compromise on internet-exposed MDM, ideal for credential theft and lateral movement into core environments.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify any Ivanti EPMM instances (external and internal) and verify patch/mitigation status with infra teams; if unpatched & exposed, treat as suspected compromised and request IR-led triage.  \n    - Hunt last 30–60 days for unusual access to EPMM URLs, spikes in 4xx/5xx, new admin accounts, config changes, and outbound connections from EPMM servers.\n\n- **OpenSSL multiple vulnerabilities including high-severity RCE**  \n  - What happened: OpenSSL released security updates fixing 12 flaws, one being high-severity RCE affecting commonly deployed versions.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: OpenSSL is embedded across appliances, servers, and applications; lagging patching may leave externally facing financial services endpoints vulnerable to remote compromise or DoS.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Coordinate with platform teams to identify high-risk, internet-facing systems using affected OpenSSL builds and confirm a patching/maintenance window.  \n    - For key web/TLS endpoints, monitor for anomalies around TLS handshakes, error spikes, or crash/restart patterns in web/proxy/load-balancer logs.\n\n- **SmarterMail unauthenticated RCE (CVSS 9.3) – patched but exploitable**  \n  - What happened: SmarterTools disclosed and patched a critical unauthenticated RCE in SmarterMail; active scanning is expected.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: If used by subsidiaries or SaaS/external partners, compromise of mail can lead directly to BEC, lateral phishing, and data theft.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm whether any entities under our umbrella or key service providers run SmarterMail; if so, validate patching or enforce emergency isolation from the internet.  \n    - Monitor inbound connections to any SmarterMail endpoints (if present) for exploit-like patterns (unusual long URIs, malformed headers) and trigger IR if suspicious.\n\n- **Active exploitation of web-facing apps & infrastructure (Magento zero-day rootkits, IIS/UAT‑8099, Fortinet exposure)**  \n  - What happened: Reports of 200+ Magento stores compromised via suspected zero-day to gain root, UAT‑8099 targeting vulnerable IIS with web shells and PowerShell, and >3M Fortinet devices exposed on the internet.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: These show active mass-scanning and exploitation of web servers and network appliances, with strong overlap to typical financial attack surfaces (IIS, Fortinet, e‑commerce-like portals).  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Prioritize review of public-facing IIS, Fortinet, and any e-commerce or customer portals: confirm they’re on supported, patched versions and behind WAF where possible.  \n    - Hunt for indicators of web shell use and abnormal PowerShell on web servers (new .aspx/.ashx/.php files, w3wp spawning powershell.exe, unusual outbound connections).\n\n- **SaaS / AI ecosystems abused (Hugging Face Android RAT, ShinyHunters SaaS data theft)**  \n  - What happened: Hugging Face repos abused to deliver Android RAT; Google TI highlights ShinyHunters-branded campaigns targeting SaaS via vishing and OAuth abuse.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Increased risk from supply-chain and SaaS data theft – attacker access via developer AI tooling and social engineering of staff into granting OAuth or SSO access.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Intensify monitoring on IdP/OAuth logs for new third-party app consents, unusual token grants, and off-hours sign-in attempts; quickly revoke suspicious consents.  \n    - Flag unusual access to AI/model-hosting platforms or code repositories from corporate endpoints (especially new domains or unsigned binaries) for review.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Ivanti EPMM exploitation / perimeter devices**  \n  - Log sources: WAF, VPN/firewall, EPMM app logs, OS logs on EPMM hosts; EDR where available.  \n  - Hunt for: Anomalous POSTs to EPMM APIs, unexpected file writes or bash execution from web processes (T1190, T1059.004).\n\n- **Web shells and PowerShell backdoors (IIS/UAT‑8099, TAMECAT)**  \n  - Log sources: IIS logs, Windows Event Logs (Sysmon/EDR), PowerShell logs (Module/Script Block), proxy.  \n  - Hunt for: w3wp.exe or other web processes spawning powershell.exe/cmd.exe, encoded command lines, new or modified web content outside change windows (T1505.003, T1059.001/003).\n\n- **Credential theft from browsers (TAMECAT targeting Edge/Chrome)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows security logs, application logs on endpoints.  \n  - Hunt for: Unsigned/unknown PowerShell scripts accessing browser profile directories, LSASS or DPAPI access, unusual exfil to rare external IPs (T1555.003, T1041).\n\n- **SaaS/OAuth abuse and ShinyHunters-style campaigns**  \n  - Log sources: IdP (Azure AD/Okta), SaaS audit logs (M365, Google Workspace, code repos), email and voice-phishing reporting channels.  \n  - Hunt for: New OAuth app registrations or consents by non-admins, impossible travel, logins from atypical ASNs, mass access/download from SaaS (T1078, T1528).\n\n- **Hugging Face / AI tooling abuse & supply chain**  \n  - Log sources: Web proxy, EDR, developer workstation logs, code repository access logs.  \n  - Hunt for: Downloads of Android packages, scripts, or binaries from AI/model-hosting domains outside normal dev patterns; unsigned tools launched shortly after such downloads (T1195, T1204).\n\n- **OpenSSL, SmarterMail, Fortinet anomalous behavior**  \n  - Log sources: Web servers, TLS terminators, mail server logs, appliance syslog, NDR.  \n  - Hunt for: Sudden service crashes/restarts, spikes in malformed TLS handshakes, or unusual protocol errors that may indicate exploit attempts (T1499).\n\n- **Malicious domains with education-themed lures / phishing**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, DNS logs, proxy, endpoint URL filters.  \n  - Hunt for: Education-themed domains newly seen in environment, users clicking such links, attachments delivering scripts or RATs (T1566.002, T1204.002).\n\n- **Ransomware & lateral movement precursors (general hardening context)**  \n  - Log sources: AD, EDR, Windows logs, network flows.  \n  - Hunt for: New local admins, DC reconnaissance, mass SMB connections, shadow copy deletion, and suspicious use of built-in tools (T1087, T1021.002, T1486, T1105).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive Ivanti/Perimeter device risk review**  \n  - Inventory all Ivanti, Fortinet, and similar management/VPN appliances; confirm patch cadence, backup/restore readiness, and logging coverage into SIEM.\n\n- **OpenSSL & third-party component governance**  \n  - Work with platform and application owners to ensure SBOM visibility and a process to quickly map new OpenSSL/Crypto CVEs to affected services.\n\n- **SaaS and AI usage governance**  \n  - Establish/update policies for use of AI platforms (Hugging Face, OpenClaw-like tools, model hubs) and enforce least-privilege OAuth consent and app review.\n\n- **Web application & e‑commerce exposure reduction**  \n  - Schedule in-depth assessments of any customer-facing portals (IIS, e‑commerce-like, Magento-derivatives) including WAF rules tuning and regular virtual patching.\n\n- **Endpoint hardening against PowerShell/backdoor misuse**  \n  - Align with engineering to enforce PowerShell Constrained Language Mode where feasible, script signing, and ensure enhanced logging (Module, ScriptBlock, Transcription) is standardized.\n\n- **AD/Identity hardening**  \n  - Leverage Microsoft’s AD hardening guidance (e.g., NTLM reduction) to plan phased rollout in test then production, focusing on reducing credential theft and relay risks tied to ransomware operations.",
