  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of a new Cisco HTTP service zero‑day plus probing of a Cisco RCE flaw raises immediate risk to perimeter/branch infrastructure.\n- A recently disclosed 2024 VMware vulnerability is now being actively targeted; hypervisor/virtualization security requires priority review.\n- Continued reports of fully patched FortiGate firewalls being compromised underscore likely misconfig or unknown vectors; perimeter device telemetry and config integrity are key.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cisco HTTP web services zero‑day (CVE‑2026‑20045) – active exploitation**\n  - What happened: Cisco confirmed in-the-wild exploitation of a new zero‑day in its HTTP web services plus wider probing of a related Cisco RCE flaw.\n  - Why it matters operationally: High risk of perimeter device takeover, traffic inspection/bypass, and credential theft if we run affected Cisco gear.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Identify all Cisco devices with HTTP/HTTPS management exposed; ensure mgmt is restricted to admin networks/VPN only.  \n    • Increase monitoring of Cisco device logs for config changes, new users, unexpected reloads, and interactive web logins from unusual IPs.\n\n- **VMware 2024 vulnerability now actively targeted**\n  - What happened: A serious VMware flaw disclosed in 2024 now has exploits in the wild and is being targeted by attackers.\n  - Why it matters operationally: If we use vulnerable VMware components (ESXi/vCenter/Workstation/Cloud), this is a potential for hypervisor escape, lateral movement, or management plane compromise.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Confirm with infra which VMware products/versions are in use and whether the 2024 flaw is patched; treat unpatched as at-risk assets.  \n    • Hunt for suspicious activity from management subnets: unusual logins to vCenter, new ESXi datastore mounts, snapshot abuse, or new administrative accounts.\n\n- **FortiGate: compromises reported even on fully patched devices**\n  - What happened: Recent summary notes incidents where fully patched FortiGate firewalls are being compromised; details indicate misconfig, credential theft, or unknown vectors.\n  - Why it matters operationally: We may have a false sense of security from patching alone; exposed VPN/SSL portals and weak/absent MFA are prime initial access points.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Verify FortiGate admin/VPN access is MFA‑protected and not exposed broadly to the internet; flag any internet‑exposed admin interfaces to network team.  \n    • Review logs for anomalous SSL‑VPN logins (impossible travel, new devices, brute force patterns) and unexpected policy/config changes.\n\n- **General increase in exploit PoCs and attack how‑tos (Wi‑Fi, NFC, Linux SELinux tooling, web/API)**\n  - What happened: Multiple PoC/exploit and “cheatsheet” releases (Wi‑Fi hacking, NFC crypto weaknesses, SELinux policy auditor, web/API exploitation) are circulating.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Lowers skill barrier for internal attackers and external opportunists, likely driving more noisy scanning/brute forcing and misconfig exploitation.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Tighten anomaly detection thresholds on perimeter (web/API, Wi‑Fi controller, VPN) for a spike in scanning or auth failures.  \n    • Watch for privilege escalation or policy manipulation on Linux servers (SELinux changes, new capabilities, T1068).\n\n- **Malware activity roundups & agentic‑AI abuse discussions**\n  - What happened: Latest malware newsletter plus AI‑abuse writeups highlight evolving delivery, persistence, and social‑engineering techniques (including AI‑assisted phishing and remote-control “agents”).\n  - Why it matters operationally: Expect more convincing phishing, rapid adaptation of malware to our defenses, and use of legit tooling for C2 and automation.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Pay extra attention to suspicious but “clean-looking” email with financial lures, QR codes, or links to cloud storage.  \n    • Prioritize investigation of living‑off‑the‑land style activity (PowerShell, WMI, LOLBins) with unusual parent/child relationships on endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Cisco / perimeter appliances (Cisco, FortiGate, other firewalls & VPNs)**  \n  - Log sources: Device syslog, NetFlow, VPN logs, management-plane HTTP/HTTPS logs.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • New local admin accounts or privilege changes (T1098).  \n    • Config changes outside change windows; unexpected restarts.  \n    • Authentication from foreign/rare ASN IPs to admin/VPN interfaces (T1078).\n\n- **VMware and virtualization infrastructure**  \n  - Log sources: vCenter/ESXi logs, hypervisor management, admin bastion/Jump host logs.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • New or modified SSO/IdP integrations; new vCenter roles or permissions.  \n    • Sudden increase in snapshot operations, datastore mounts, and ISO uploads (T1059, T1105).\n\n- **Endpoint (EDR) – exploit and PoC tooling use**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, OS logs on Linux and Windows.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • Unexpected use of compilers, network scanners, packet capture tools on servers (T1046, T1040).  \n    • SELinux policy file edits, `setenforce 0`, or loading of new SELinux modules on critical Linux hosts.\n\n- **Web/API front ends and WAF**  \n  - Log sources: Web server logs, API gateway, WAF, reverse proxies.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • Spikes in 400/401/403/500 errors from single IP ranges (recon/brute-force).  \n    • Suspicious query patterns suggesting injection or auth bypass attempts (T1190).\n\n- **Wi‑Fi / NAC / internal network edge**  \n  - Log sources: Wireless controller, RADIUS/NAC, DHCP.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • New/unknown device MACs associated with staff SSIDs; rapid reassociation events.  \n    • Auth failures followed by success from same device (possible password spraying or stolen creds).\n\n- **Email and collaboration platforms**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, M365/Google Workspace logs, messaging apps.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • Financial lures, approval-of-payment themes, urgent account changes, QR-code based login prompts (T1566).  \n    • OAuth consent grants to new third‑party apps; unusual mailbox rules (T1098.003, T1114).\n\n- **Identity & access (IdP, PAM, AD)**  \n  - Log sources: IdP audit logs, AD security logs, PAM solutions.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • New MFA enrollments, especially for privileged accounts, and push-bombing patterns.  \n    • Lateral movement indicators: Kerberos delegation abuse, abnormal use of `PsExec`, RDP, or SSH between servers (T1021).\n\n- **Network – C2 & data exfil**  \n  - Log sources: Proxy, DNS, NetFlow, DLP.  \n  - Focus:  \n    • Long-lived outbound connections to rare domains/IPs, especially over non-standard ports (T1071).  \n    • Data volume anomalies from servers that normally have low outbound traffic (T1041).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Cisco zero‑day & VMware 2024 vuln – patching and hardening**  \n  - Coordinate with infra to confirm product/version mapping, patch status, and compensating controls (network ACLs, VPN-only management, strong auth).\n\n- **Perimeter device baseline & hardening review**  \n  - Establish/refresh gold-standard configurations for FortiGate, Cisco, and other firewalls/VPNs; include MFA everywhere, strict admin ACLs, and logging to SIEM by default.\n\n- **Virtualization & backup resilience**  \n  - Review access model for vCenter/ESXi and backup systems; minimize admin accounts, segment management networks, and test restore from offline/immutable backups.\n\n- **Playbooks for network device compromise**  \n  - Update/validate incident response runbooks for suspected firewall/VPN/router compromise (containment, key/credential rotation, configuration integrity checks).\n\n- **Enhanced phishing & fraud awareness for business units**  \n  - Run targeted awareness focused on payment fraud, deepfake/AI‑assisted social engineering, and updated internal processes for verifying high‑value transactions.\n\n- **AI/automation governance for security and IT tooling**  \n  - Work with risk/GRC to define guidelines for AI/agent use (no direct production access without oversight, logging of automated actions, review of prompts for sensitive data).",
