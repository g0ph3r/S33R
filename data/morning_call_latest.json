(MITRE: T1190, T1068, T1078)\n\n- **Ransomware/BYOVD & destructive behaviors (Osiris, DynoWiper)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, file server logs.  \n  - Focus: new/unknown drivers installed (`Service Control Manager` events), termination of security processes, `vssadmin delete shadows`, `wmic shadowcopy delete`, spikes in file renames/deletes. (T1068, T1489, T1485, T1562.001)\n\n- **Phishing to RAT/ransomware (Marriott typo, Amnesia RAT)**\n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, EDR, DNS/proxy, browser logs.  \n  - Focus: messages from newly registered domains, brand impersonation, Office/PDF → script → network connection patterns, new persistence (scheduled tasks, Run keys) after email clicks. (T1566, T1204, T1059, T1053)\n\n- **SSO / IdP abuse (ShinyHunters claims)**\n  - Log sources: IdP/SSO (Okta, Entra ID, etc.), VPN, CASB, SaaS audit logs.  \n  - Focus: new devices/locations for admins, failed MFA followed by success from different IP, new OAuth apps with high‑priv scopes, unusual token refresh patterns. (T1078, T1550, T1552.004)\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS account data theft**\n  - Log sources: Cloud storage (O365, GDrive, S3), data egress gateways, proxy.  \n  - Focus: large downloads/exports from SSO-integrated apps, API key usage from atypical regions, mass access to user lists or profile endpoints. (T1530, T1114, T1567)\n\n- **Potential AI‑assisted / LLM prompt‑injection abuse (early trend)**\n  - Log sources: Any internal AI/LLM gateway logs, application logs using LLMs for automation.  \n  - Focus: prompts containing “ignore previous instructions,” attempts to exfiltrate secrets/configs, abnormal automated actions triggered by LLM outputs. (T1608.005, T1552)\n\n- **General credential & encryption‑related issues (BitLocker / key handling)**\n  - Log sources: Endpoint management, BitLocker logs, HSM/KMS logs.  \n  - Focus: unexpected BitLocker recovery key access, mass key export attempts, changes in disk encryption policies on user or server segments. (T1555, T1552)\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Urgent VMware vCenter patch & hardening program**\n  - Coordinate with infrastructure to patch all affected vCenter builds; restrict management planes to admin networks/VPN; review role assignments and service accounts.\n\n- **BYOVD exposure assessment**\n  - Work with endpoint/security engineering to ensure kernel driver blocklists are enabled (e.g., Windows vulnerable driver blocklist, EDR custom blocklists); remove obsolete drivers commonly abused in BYOVD attacks.\n\n- **SSO / IdP security posture review**\n  - Enforce strong MFA for all accounts (especially admin); implement risk‑based and device‑based conditional access; review and prune unused SAML/OIDC integrations and OAuth consents.\n\n- **Phishing resilience & user awareness**\n  - Refresh training with focus on brand impersonation and subtle domain typos; reinforce “report suspicious email” process; run a targeted simulation around lookalike domains.\n\n- **Backup, recovery, and wiper‑resilience testing**\n  - Validate RPO/RTO and test restores for key systems; ensure at least one offline/immutable backup tier; document and rehearse response runbooks for destructive attacks and mass encryption.\n\n- **Third‑party and data‑sharing risk (in light of breaches & key disclosure news)**\n  - Review critical vendors handling customer data and encryption keys; confirm contractual and technical controls on key management, law enforcement access, and incident notification SLAs.",
