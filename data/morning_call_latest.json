  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Fortinet FortiGate/FortiWeb SSO/auth bypass flaws are under active exploitation days after patch release; edge devices are being used for credential theft and initial access.\n- React2Shell in React Server Components and a new Apple WebKit zero‑day are being exploited in the wild to deploy backdoors and run arbitrary code.\n- Malicious browser/extension and NuGet packages are exfiltrating AI chat inputs and crypto wallet data, highlighting growing client‑side and supply‑chain abuse.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Fortinet FortiGate/FortiWeb SSO / auth bypass actively exploited**\n  - What happened: Multiple FortiGate SAML SSO/auth bypass and FortiWeb admin takeover vulnerabilities (incl. CVE-2025-64446 and related) are being weaponized in the wild for full admin access and credential theft.\n  - Why it matters: Edge firewalls/WAFs are high-value for VPN access, east‑west visibility bypass and staging ransomware; compromise may bypass MFA and network segmentation.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with infra which Fortinet products/versions we run; verify latest Fortinet advisories/patches applied.  \n    - Threat hunt last 14–30 days: unusual logins to FortiGate admin/SSO, config changes, new admin users, unknown IPs; review VPN logs for anomalous geos/devices directly after SSO events.  \n\n- **React2Shell RCE in React Server Components – active exploitation for Linux backdoors**\n  - What happened: The React2Shell RCE is being actively exploited to compromise React Server Components and deploy Linux backdoors; Microsoft has published mitigations.\n  - Why it matters: Any customer‑facing or internal web app built with affected React server components on Linux could be a stealthy web‑tier entry point for data theft or lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Coordinate with app owners to identify any Internet‑exposed React server workloads; confirm whether vendor mitigations/patches are applied.  \n    - Monitor WAF/NGFW and Linux EDR for unexpected shell spawns from Node/React processes, outbound C2 from web servers, and anomalous modifications to app directories.\n\n- **Apple WebKit zero‑day (CVE-2025-14174) exploited in targeted attacks**\n  - What happened: CISA and others report an Apple WebKit memory corruption 0‑day being actively used in targeted campaigns (likely via malicious web content).\n  - Why it matters: Staff using Safari/iOS/macOS to access internal portals, email or privileged apps could be compromised via drive‑by attacks, bypassing traditional email controls.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with IT that latest iOS/iPadOS/macOS/Safari security updates are being urgently deployed, prioritizing high‑risk users (execs, traders, admins).  \n    - Increase monitoring for suspicious connections from Apple devices to newly observed domains; review EDR telemetry where available for browser‑spawned processes or persistence post‑browsing.\n\n- **Malicious browser extensions & VPN app harvesting AI chats and other data**\n  - What happened: A widely used Chrome extension (~6M installs) and the Urban VPN browser extension were caught capturing user inputs to AI chatbots and stealing private AI chats.\n  - Why it matters: If installed on corporate endpoints, they can exfiltrate sensitive prompts, internal code, credentials and confidential financial data pasted into AI tools, bypassing normal DLP.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Query EDR/endpoint management for presence of Urban VPN and the flagged Chrome extension (or any unapproved VPN/AI helper extensions); coordinate immediate removal.  \n    - Enhance proxy/secure web gateway blocks for known extension update URLs/domains if available, and monitor for unusual outbound traffic from browsers with many extensions.\n\n- **Malicious NuGet package stealing cryptocurrency wallet data**\n  - What happened: A malicious NuGet package masquerading as a .NET logging tool is stealing cryptocurrency wallet information and exfiltrating data.\n  - Why it matters: Indicates ongoing supply‑chain risk in developer ecosystems; any dev workstation or build agent pulling unvetted NuGet packages could be a pivot into banking back‑end code or secrets.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Ask dev/security engineering for a quick check of recent NuGet additions to CI/CD and developer projects; flag any match with the reported malicious package family for workstation/build host review.  \n    - Monitor developer endpoints for abnormal outbound connections from build tools/IDE processes and unusual PowerShell / .NET processes starting shortly after package restores.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Fortinet edge device abuse (APT & random attackers) – SSO/auth bypass**\n  - Logs: FortiGate/FortiWeb admin logs, VPN/SSL VPN logs, IdP SAML logs, perimeter firewall.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Logins to admin or SSO endpoints from atypical geos/ASNs or outside business hours (ATT&CK T1133 – External Remote Services, T1078 – Valid Accounts).  \n    - Sudden config exports, policy changes, or creation of new SSO/LDAP/OAuth configurations.\n\n- **Web application RCE (React2Shell)**\n  - Logs: WAF/NGFW, web server (Nginx/Apache), application logs, Linux EDR.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Requests with anomalous headers/payload patterns, followed by shell/child processes from Node/React users (T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application, T1059 – Command Shell).  \n    - New binaries or scripts appearing in web app directories; unexpected outbound traffic from web servers to rare destinations.\n\n- **Apple/WebKit exploitation**\n  - Logs: EDR on macOS, DNS/proxy logs, MDM telemetry.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Safari/WebKit spawning unusual processes (curl, bash, Python), new LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons shortly after browsing (T1204 – User Execution, T1547 – Boot or Logon Autostart).  \n    - Clusters of connections from Apple devices to domains first seen in last 24–48h.\n\n- **Malicious browser extensions / VPN extensions**\n  - Logs: Browser extension inventory (if available), EDR, proxy/DNS logs.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - HTTP(S) POSTs with large payloads to extension backends from browsers, especially to domains not associated with our approved SaaS (T1119 – Data from Information Repositories, T1041 – Exfiltration over C2 Channel).  \n    - Endpoints with many non‑standard extensions installed, especially VPNs or AI helpers.\n\n- **Supply-chain malware via NuGet / dev tools**\n  - Logs: Developer workstation EDR, build server logs, package manager logs, outbound proxy.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Execution of unknown .NET binaries or PowerShell launched from NuGet cache or project folders (T1059.001 – PowerShell, T1203 – Exploitation for Client Execution).  \n    - New outbound connections from build agents/IDEs to domains not in our dev allowlist.\n\n- **Ransomware preparation (LLM‑driven automation, Windows 10 risk)**\n  - Logs: EDR, Windows event logs, backup/DR systems, admin tooling.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Mass discovery and archiving activity, shadow copy deletion, disabling AV, or scripted triage of file servers from admin accounts (T1486 – Data Encrypted, T1489 – Service Stop).  \n    - On legacy Windows 10/older systems, look for lateral movement tools (PsExec, WMI, RDP) and new scheduled tasks.\n\n- **VoIP/FreePBX exploitation**\n  - Logs: FreePBX logs, SIP firewall, Linux EDR.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Anonymous or unusual IPs invoking admin or provisioning endpoints, followed by OS command execution or new web shells on PBX servers (T1190, T1505 – Server‑Side Components).\n\n- **Messaging account hijack (GhostPairing for WhatsApp) – user risk**\n  - Logs: Mobile device management, DNS/proxy, identity logs.  \n  - Focus/hunt:  \n    - Unusual WhatsApp Web usage from corporate browsers, especially immediately after password reset or new device pairings (T1078 – Valid Accounts, T1098 – Account Manipulation).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Fortinet hardening and segmentation**\n  - Complete full patching and hardening of all Fortinet appliances; ensure management interfaces are not Internet‑exposed and 2FA is enforced for all admin/VPN accounts.  \n  - Implement regular backup and integrity checks of Fortinet configs and enable detailed logging to central SIEM.\n\n- **Web application and open‑source dependency hygiene**\n  - Conduct a targeted review of React‑based and other Internet‑facing apps for dependency versions and WAF rules; integrate SCA (software composition analysis) into CI/CD.  \n  - Validate that WAF signatures for recent CVEs (React2Shell, FreePBX, ScreenConnect, etc.) are enabled and tuned.\n\n- **Browser and extension policy tightening**\n  - Enforce a strict browser extension allowlist (especially for VPNs, AI helpers, crypto tools) and remove Urban VPN and similar from any approved channels.  \n  - Update security awareness: do not paste sensitive data into AI web UIs from unmanaged devices or via unvetted extensions.\n\n- **Apple/macOS/iOS fleet management**\n  - Ensure all corporate Apple devices are enrolled in MDM with enforced timely OS/browser patching SLAs and telemetry to SIEM.  \n  - Define incident playbooks for suspected mobile/browser 0‑day exploitation (triage, containment, re‑imaging).\n\n- **Developer and CI/CD supply-chain controls**\n  - Establish/refresh policies for allowed NuGet/NPM/PyPI sources; implement signed/verified packages and repository allowlists.  \n  - Add specific detections and regular hunts for anomalous behavior on build agents and high‑privilege dev workstations.\n\n- **Ransomware playbook and legacy OS risk reduction**\n  - Review/update our ransomware playbook using latest guidance; run a table‑top focused on firewall edge compromise plus rapid ransomware deployment.  \n  - Work with infra to accelerate decommissioning or isolation of legacy Windows (10 and older) systems that cannot be fully secured.",
