  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Multiple perimeter security products (Cisco Secure Email, FortiGate, SonicWall, Cisco & Palo Alto VPNs) are under active exploitation; assume widespread scanning and opportunistic compromise.\n- New Windows Desktop Window Manager local privilege escalation and evolving ransomware tooling increase impact if initial access is gained.\n- Phishing campaigns (DarkGate “Word Online” lure, Chrome zero‑day, browser extensions, malicious QR codes/mobile apps) continue to be key vectors; strengthen email/web/mobile monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cisco Secure Email (AsyncOS) 0‑day – appliances being rooted and backdoored**  \n  - What happened: Unpatched 0‑day in Cisco AsyncOS email security is being actively exploited for system-level command execution and persistent backdoors.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct compromise of mail relays/filters enables interception/tampering of email (BEC), credential theft, and pivoting into internal networks.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify if we run Cisco Secure Email / ESA; if yes, pull current config and logs off-box, and coordinate emergency review with infra team.  \n    - Hunt on ESA and internal network for unusual admin logins, config changes, outbound connections from ESA to unknown IPs/domains, and new local accounts/scripts; be prepared to recommend isolation if compromise indicators are found.\n\n- **Actively exploited VPN / firewall flaws (Fortinet, SonicWall SMA 100, Cisco & Palo Alto VPN gateways)**  \n  - What happened: CISA and vendors report active exploitation of auth-bypass / signature-verification issues in FortiGate, SonicWall SMA 100, Gladinet CentreStack/Triofox, plus mass login attacks on Cisco & Palo Alto VPNs.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: These are common perimeter gateways; compromise leads to direct network access, credential theft, and staging for ransomware or APT operations.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with infra which versions/models we run; ensure latest patches are applied or compensating controls (e.g., geofencing, MFA enforcement, admin interface not exposed).  \n    - Review last 14 days of VPN/firewall logs for: new source countries, password-spray patterns, abnormal admin logins, config changes, and new VPN users/devices; escalate any anomalies to IR.\n\n- **Windows Desktop Window Manager (DWM) LPE (CVE-2025-55681) – viable post-exploitation booster**  \n  - What happened: New DWM out-of-bounds / LPE vulnerability publicly documented, enabling elevation from user to SYSTEM on Windows.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Once attackers gain a foothold (phish/VPN), this bug can be used to disable AV/EDR, dump creds, and persist with high privileges.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - In EDR, hunt for suspicious use of `dwm.exe`, abnormal token-manipulation, or unsigned binaries spawning from user context to SYSTEM shortly after initial infection indicators.  \n    - Coordinate with patch management to prioritize test & deployment of Microsoft’s fix once available; treat any suspected compromise as potentially SYSTEM-level.\n\n- **Phishing/malware waves: DarkGate “ClickFix Word Online”, Chrome 0‑day campaigns, GhostPoster & mobile RATs**  \n  - What happened: Multiple campaigns: DarkGate via fake “Word Online” update messages, operations exploiting Chrome 0‑days, malicious Firefox PNG-icon extension (GhostPoster), and cheap Cellik Android RAT / Kimsuky QR-based malicious apps.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Higher chance of user-driven initial access from email/web/mobile; potential credential theft and lateral movement from BYOD or poorly managed endpoints.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Tighten email/web proxy detections: flag links to fake “Word/Office Online” portals, unexpected browser extension installs, and executables from cloud storage/file-sharing sites.  \n    - Watch MDM/endpoint telemetry for new/unknown Android apps on corporate-managed devices and push an advisory to helpdesk about “Word Online / browser update” phishing themes.\n\n- **ShadowPad / “Ink Dragon” APT targeting IIS to build stealthy C2 networks**  \n  - What happened: Chinese-linked actors are deploying ShadowPad via a custom IIS listener module (“Ink Dragon”) turning compromised IIS servers into relay nodes.  \n  - Why it matters operationally: Internet-facing IIS apps (including OWA/legacy apps) can become stealth C2 hubs, bypassing usual perimeter monitoring and serving as staging points into internal networks and partner connections.  \n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify all IIS servers; check for unexpected modules, edits to `applicationHost.config`, or recently modified DLLs in IIS module paths; compare against approved baseline.  \n    - Monitor for IIS worker processes (`w3wp.exe`) making outbound connections to unfamiliar IPs/ports and serving atypical traffic volumes; escalate any suspicious servers for forensic review.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Perimeter devices (Cisco ESA, FortiGate, SonicWall, Cisco/PAN VPNs, CentreStack/Triofox)**  \n  - Log sources: VPN/firewall logs, device syslog, admin audit logs.  \n  - Hunts: Repeated failed logins (T1110), login from new geos/ASNs, sudden config/firmware changes, creation of new admin accounts, unexpected outbound connections from those appliances (T1105).\n\n- **Windows LPE & ransomware staging (DWM LPE, RansomHouse evolution)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Security logs, Sysmon.  \n  - Hunts: Rapid sequence of user->SYSTEM privilege change without standard tools (T1068), `lsass.exe` access (T1003), shadow copy deletion, mass encryption behavior, or abnormal use of `vssadmin`, `wbadmin`, `bcdedit`.\n\n- **Email & web phishing (DarkGate ClickFix, Chrome 0‑day lures, Kimsuky QR, GhostPoster)**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, web proxy, DNS, browser extension inventories.  \n  - Hunts: Links to newly registered domains in Office-themed messages (T1566.002), downloads of EXE/ISO/JS/LOLBINs from cloud drives, sudden spikes in browser extension installs or extension updates (T1176).\n\n- **IIS / web server compromise (Ink Dragon / ShadowPad modules)**  \n  - Log sources: IIS logs, Windows Event Logs, file integrity monitoring on web roots and `inetsrv`/module directories.  \n  - Hunts: `w3wp.exe` spawning cmd/PowerShell (T1059), unusual HTTP verbs/paths, large outbound connections from web servers to rare IPs (T1071).\n\n- **VPN identity abuse & lateral movement**  \n  - Log sources: VPN, IdP/SSO, AD, NetFlow/Zeek.  \n  - Hunts: Valid accounts from unexpected locations/devices (T1078), impossible travel, off-hours admin access, sudden increase in SMB/RDP from VPN concentrators or user subnets (T1021).\n\n- **Browser and extension-based attacks (GhostPoster, Chrome 0‑day, ShadyPanda-like browser takeover)**  \n  - Log sources: Endpoint/browser management, EDR, web proxy.  \n  - Hunts: New browser processes with unusual command-lines, injection into browser processes (T1055), unknown extensions with high permissions, or browser making outbound C2-like beacon patterns (small, regular, encrypted).\n\n- **Mobile malware (Cellik RAT, malicious QR-based apps)**  \n  - Log sources: MDM, mobile AV, VPN client logs.  \n  - Hunts: Unapproved app installs, new VPN profiles from mobile, unusual DNS/HTTP patterns from mobile subnets to rare domains (T1430 / T1432 in mobile MITRE).\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS abuse (APT vs Western critical infrastructure, CASB focus)**  \n  - Log sources: Cloud audit logs (O365, GCP/AWS/Azure), CASB if deployed, IdP logs.  \n  - Hunts: Creation of new OAuth apps, consent grants, mailbox rules for auto-forward (T1114.003), API tokens created from unusual IPs, or privilege escalations inside cloud consoles.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Comprehensive perimeter review & hardening**  \n  - Inventory all VPNs, email gateways, firewalls, file-sharing portals; ensure patch cadence, MFA, IP allow-listing, and removal of direct internet-exposed admin interfaces.\n\n- **Patch management uplift for high-impact Windows & web-facing vulnerabilities**  \n  - Prioritize Windows LPEs (including DWM), browser zero-days, and key third-party apps (Nagios XI, NVIDIA Isaac Lab) into the normal patch pipeline with defined SLAs.\n\n- **IIS and legacy web application security program**  \n  - Establish/refresh baseline of modules, configs, and file hashes; deploy regular integrity checks and consider segmenting or replacing legacy IIS apps used for critical banking services.\n\n- **Phishing/awareness campaign refresh**  \n  - Update training and internal comms highlighting “Word Online update”, browser update prompts, QR-code lures, and mobile app risks; align with email gateway rulesets.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop & runbook refinement**  \n  - Incorporate latest TTPs from RansomHouse and similar groups into playbooks (data exfil, double extortion, faster encryption); validate backup isolation and restore times.\n\n- **LLM/AI and agentic tools governance**  \n  - In light of research that LLMs can be exploited and new “offensive AI” tooling, ensure policies for AI usage, prompt/response logging, and review controls for any AI integrated into customer-facing or internal systems.",
