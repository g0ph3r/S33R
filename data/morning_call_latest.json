  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of Fortinet FortiCloud/FortiOS SSO auth bypass (CVE‑2026‑24858 & related) and new guidance from CISA/Fortinet; high risk for perimeter and SSO-integrated assets.\n- Ongoing mass exploitation of WinRAR (CVE‑2025‑8088) in phishing and malware campaigns; remains a common initial access vector on Windows endpoints.\n- New critical RCEs in SolarWinds Web Help Desk, vm2 / n8n Node.js sandbox environments increase supply‑chain and internal app compromise risk.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Fortinet FortiCloud / FortiOS SSO auth bypass zero‑day (CVE‑2026‑24858 & related) – actively exploited**\n  - What happened: Critical auth bypass in multiple Fortinet products (FortiCloud SSO, FortiOS SSO) is under active exploitation; CISA added to KEV, Fortinet/CISA issued emergency guidance.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Direct bypass of authentication on edge and management services → potential full device control and pivot into internal network.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify all Fortinet devices (FortiCloud, FortiOS, FortiGate, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer) and confirm patch/mitigation status; raise to incident if unknown or unpatched.  \n    - Hunt last 30–60 days for anomalous SSO logins, logins from unusual IPs/ASNs, new admin accounts, and config changes on Fortinet gear; escalate any unexplained access.  \n\n- **WinRAR CVE‑2025‑8088 – broad, ongoing exploitation via phishing**\n  - What happened: Multiple reports (Google/Mandiant, others) confirm widespread exploitation of a previously patched WinRAR vulnerability to drop RATs and other malware via archive files.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Endpoints with outdated WinRAR can be compromised by opening a crafted archive from email/web, enabling initial access for ransomware and data theft.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Add/verify detection for suspicious archive extraction spawning scripting tools or LOLBins (cmd/powershell/wscript/mshta) from user context; block where possible.  \n    - Coordinate with IT to quickly inventory WinRAR versions; flag hosts with vulnerable versions as high-risk and increase EDR scrutiny (blocking mode, isolation-on-suspicion).  \n\n- **SolarWinds Web Help Desk critical RCE / auth bypass**\n  - What happened: SolarWinds disclosed critical Web Help Desk RCE and auth bypass flaws; PoC and deep-dive writeups are public.\n  - Why it matters operationally: If exposed to the internet (or even internal but reachable by low-priv users), attackers can achieve server-level code execution and pivot to AD/databases.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm whether we run Web Help Desk; if yes, verify patch level and whether any instances are internet-facing; if unpatched and exposed, treat as potential compromise and initiate scoped review.  \n    - Review web server and system logs for unusual inbound requests to WHD paths, unexpected child processes from the WHD service, and anomalous admin account changes since disclosure.  \n\n- **Node.js sandbox escapes – vm2 and n8n RCE**\n  - What happened: Critical vm2 sandbox escape and two high-severity n8n sandbox flaws allow authenticated RCE; exploits and chaining techniques are public.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Affects internal automation / workflow platforms and any SaaS/self-hosted tools using vm2; compromise here can lead to code execution in CI/CD or integration hubs.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify any internally hosted n8n, vm2-based apps, or third-party services with privileged access (Git, cloud, ticketing) and check patch/upgrade status; if internet-facing and unpatched, raise risk.  \n    - Increase monitoring on these hosts for new outbound connections, credential access, and unusual process execution (node, shell, curl/wget launched from app containers).  \n\n- **Ransomware ecosystem updates – RAMP forum seizure, new tools (Tsundere Bot, Sicarii)**\n  - What happened: FBI seized RAMP ransomware forum; reports of initial access brokers switching to “Tsundere Bot” for ransomware delivery and Sicarii ransomware with no decryption possible.\n  - Why it matters operationally: Short‑term disruption may push actors to new forums and tooling; IABs and ransomware affiliates may change infrastructure and TTPs but activity volume is unlikely to drop.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Maintain heightened vigilance for early-stage ransomware patterns (malicious docs/archives, new remote tools, mass encryption behavior); ensure rapid isolation runbooks are ready and tested.  \n    - Review recent alerts for C2-ish bot activity or newly observed bots/loaders on endpoints, even if not yet clearly tagged; prioritize triage for anything with credential theft or lateral movement indicators.  \n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Fortinet auth bypass & edge devices**  \n  - Log sources: Fortinet device logs, VPN/SSO logs, firewall, NetFlow.  \n  - Hunt for: Successful logins without prior failed attempts from new IPs/ASNs, logins with unusual user-agents, new/modified admin accounts or policies, unexpected config backups or firmware changes.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application).\n\n- **WinRAR / phishing-based initial access**  \n  - Log sources: Email security, EDR, proxy/DNS, Windows event logs.  \n  - Hunt for:  \n    - User-launched unarchivers spawning cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, mshta.exe, regsvr32.exe or unknown binaries shortly after file download/open.  \n    - Archives from newly registered domains or mismatched sender/display name with attachment type.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1566 (Phishing), T1204 (User Execution), T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).\n\n- **Web apps & Node.js sandbox RCE (SolarWinds WHD, n8n, vm2-based apps)**  \n  - Log sources: Web server logs (HTTP), app logs, WAF, EDR on app servers, container logs.  \n  - Hunt for: 500 errors followed by new processes (bash/sh/cmd, curl/wget, powershell) owned by web/app service accounts; new outbound connections from these servers to unfamiliar IPs.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1190, T1059 (Command Shell/Scripting), T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).\n\n- **New/updated APT malware (Mustang Panda CoolClient, PeckBirdy, residential proxy botnets)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, DNS/proxy, firewall, TLS inspection where available.  \n  - Hunt for: Long-lived C2 connections, small/regular beacon intervals to rare domains or IPs, unusual TLS JA3 from user or server endpoints; processes invoking system info and archiving/network tools.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1071 (Web/HTTPS C2), T1082 (System Information Discovery).\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS & IdP abuse (FortiCloud SSO, Cal.com broken access, leaked credentials)**  \n  - Log sources: IdP (SSO), CASB, SaaS audit logs (O365, ticketing, calendaring), VPN.  \n  - Hunt for: Impossible travel, new OAuth apps/grants, mass access to calendars/meeting data, access from TOR/residential proxies, sudden role escalations for service accounts.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1550 (Use of Web Session Cookie), T1528 (Steal Application Access Token).\n\n- **Ransomware precursors & privileged access abuse**  \n  - Log sources: AD/SIEM, EDR, PAM, Windows Security logs.  \n  - Hunt for:  \n    - New local admins, GPO changes, service installs (especially remote admin tools and backup software tampering).  \n    - Large numbers of file modifications/renames by a single process, shadow copy deletions, and use of vssadmin/wbadmin.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact), T1068 (Privilege Escalation).\n\n- **Mobile & social engineering (Android spyware, WhatsApp protections, romance scams, ad‑fraud apps)**  \n  - Log sources: MDM/MAM, email/web, HR/awareness channels.  \n  - Hunt for: Corporate email used to register suspicious mobile apps/services, spikes in MFA push fatigue events, users reporting unsolicited OTP/MFA prompts or unknown mobile management prompts.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1204, T1566, T1185 (Browser/Mobile Exploit where relevant).\n\n- **GPU/AI infrastructure abuse (hijacked GPU clusters, AI infra resale)**  \n  - Log sources: Cloud provider logs, Kubernetes/GKE, hypervisor, GPU job schedulers.  \n  - Hunt for: Unexpected long‑running GPU jobs from non‑ML teams, unusual outbound traffic from GPU nodes, containers with crypto‑mining processes (xmrig, etc.) or high CPU/GPU with low I/O.  \n  - ATT&CK: T1496 (Resource Hijacking), T1578 (Cloud Infrastructure).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Fortinet & other edge appliance hygiene**\n  - Ensure all Fortinet advisories (FortiCloud, FortiOS, legacy auth bypass CVEs) are in our vulnerability management queue with clear deadlines and compensating controls for any delayed patches.\n  - Validate backup, configuration, and incident-response playbooks specific to firewall/VPN/edge device compromise.\n\n- **Application security & third-party tools**\n  - Work with app/dev teams to inventory use of vm2, n8n, Web Help Desk, Cal.com, IDIS cameras, TP-Link routers, and similar; schedule upgrades, network segmentation, and WAF rules where necessary.\n  - Establish an internal process to flag and review “no-code/low-code” and workflow platforms for security posture before broad adoption.\n\n- **Endpoint hardening and software inventory**\n  - Phase out or tightly control third‑party archivers like WinRAR; consider standardizing on centrally managed, updated tools.\n  - Review application allowlisting and EDR prevention policies to better constrain LOLBins and script interpreters frequently abused post-exploitation.\n\n- **Ransomware preparedness**\n  - Rehearse rapid isolation and ransom response runbooks (including decision paths when data is non‑decryptable as with Sicarii); validate backups and restore times for key financial systems.\n  - Accelerate AD hardening activities (e.g., reduce always-on privileged access, follow guidance such as disabling NTLM where feasible).\n\n- **Supply chain & open-source risk**\n  - Review our exposure to malicious open-source packages (esp. JavaScript/Node, Python) by ensuring scanning (SCA) is enforced in CI/CD and that alerts are being triaged.\n  - Engage with key SaaS vendors (ticketing, help desk, AI “assistants”) to confirm patching of recent vulnerabilities and to obtain security attestations where needed.\n\n- **User awareness for social engineering and mobile threats**\n  - Update awareness materials to cover archive-based malware, romance/WhatsApp scams, and malicious Android apps, emphasizing not to install non-corporate apps on BYOD that access corporate data.\n  - Encourage prompt reporting of suspicious DMs, unexpected archives, and mobile prompts to enable faster containment.",
