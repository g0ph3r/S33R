  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n\n- Active exploitation and PoC code around **Fortinet FortiSIEM**, **Palo Alto GlobalProtect**, and **Azure Windows Admin Center** significantly increase exposure on perimeter and management planes.\n- New **AI-assistant “Reprompt” data exfiltration attacks** and **ServiceNow AI platform impersonation** show concrete risk from AI-assistant integrations into enterprise data.\n- Ongoing **ransomware & data‑theft operations** (Sicarii RaaS, DeadLock, deVixor) continue to target exposed RDP, Fortinet gear, and crypto/Android ecosystems – watch for initial access and data staging.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Fortinet FortiSIEM critical RCE – actively exploited (CVE‑2025‑64155)**\n  - What: Critical FortiSIEM vulnerability with public PoC and reports of active exploitation.\n  - Why it matters: Direct path to root on SIEM appliance = potential log tampering, pivot into core network, and stealthy persistence.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm whether any FortiSIEM instances exist and their version; if present, verify emergency patching / mitigations with infra team.  \n    - Hunt last 14 days: unusual log deletions, config changes, new admin users, unexpected outbound connections from SIEM to internet.\n\n- **Palo Alto GlobalProtect firewall DoS flaw with PoC**\n  - What: Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN/firewall DoS vulnerability patched; PoC publicly available.\n  - Why it matters: Low‑effort unauthenticated DoS can knock out VPN/firewall, impacting availability and potentially used as cover for parallel intrusions.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Verify versions/patch status of any Palo Alto firewalls; if unpatched, raise to critical and ensure maintenance window is scheduled ASAP.  \n    - Add monitoring for repeated malformed/abnormal GlobalProtect connections from single IPs; prepare playbook for rapid failover if perimeter devices go down.\n\n- **Azure Windows Admin Center token flaw – tenant‑wide compromise (CVE‑2026‑20965)**\n  - What: Token validation vulnerability in Windows Admin Center for Azure enabling tenant‑wide RCE/compromise.\n  - Why it matters: Direct impact on our Azure tenant if WAC is in use; attacker can control Windows servers and potentially domain infra via cloud management.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with cloud/Windows teams whether Azure WAC is in use; if so, ensure patching/update status is known and recent.  \n    - Review Azure sign‑in / WAC logs for suspicious admin operations, unfamiliar IPs, and token anomalies over last 14 days; tighten conditional access/MFA on admin roles.\n\n- **AI platforms & Copilot: ‘Reprompt’ data exfil + ServiceNow AI agent vuln**\n  - What: New “Reprompt” technique abusing Microsoft Copilot for silent data exfil, and a critical ServiceNow AI Platform bug enabling user impersonation.\n  - Why it matters: We increasingly integrate AI with sensitive data; prompt‑injection and agent impersonation can bypass traditional DLP and access controls.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Identify any production use of Microsoft Copilot / ServiceNow AI; validate that latest security updates/controls are applied.  \n    - Coordinate with platform owners to log and retain AI assistant activity where possible; flag anomalous large data access/exports initiated via AI features.\n\n- **New Sicarii RaaS + Fortinet targeting & exposed RDP**\n  - What: New Sicarii ransomware‑as‑a‑service targeting exposed RDP and Fortinet devices; other campaigns (DeadLock, deVixor) emphasize data‑theft‑first behavior.\n  - Why it matters: RDP exposure and unpatched perimeter devices remain primary entry points for financial orgs; trend continues toward pure exfiltration/extortion.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Re‑check that no RDP is directly exposed to the internet; aggressively alert on external RDP attempts and anomalous VPN logins.  \n    - Hunt for early‑stage ransomware activity: new scheduled tasks, shadow copy deletions, abnormal archiving and outbound data flows from servers.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Perimeter appliances (Fortinet, Palo Alto, other VPNs)**  \n  - Log sources: Firewall/VPN logs, syslog from appliances, NetFlow.  \n  - Hunt for unusual admin logins, config changes, unexpected restarts/DoS events, and outbound connections from appliances (ATT&CK: T1078, T1565.001, T1499).\n\n- **Azure / cloud management (Windows Admin Center, CodeBuild, ServiceNow)**  \n  - Log sources: Azure AD sign‑ins, Azure Activity, WAC logs, AWS CloudTrail/CodeBuild, ServiceNow audit logs.  \n  - Look for new OAuth apps, unusual service principals, new API tokens, mass project or pipeline modifications, and cross‑account access patterns (T1098, T1090, T1078.004).\n\n- **AI assistant and SaaS data access (Copilot, AI agents)**  \n  - Log sources: M365 audit logs (Search, SharePoint, OneDrive), application audit logs for AI features.  \n  - Monitor for atypical bulk file reads/searches by user accounts via AI interfaces, and sudden spikes in export/download actions (T1114, T1020).\n\n- **RDP and remote admin channels (Sicarii, general ransomware initial access)**  \n  - Log sources: Windows Security logs, EDR, VPN logs, remote access gateways.  \n  - Alert on failed RDP bursts, RDP from unusual geos, lateral RDP within network, and new local admin creations post‑login (T1133, T1075/T1021.001).\n\n- **Web & app layer (WordPress Modular DS, Cal.com, n8n, npm, c‑ares DLL side‑loading)**  \n  - Log sources: WAF, web server logs, container/app logs, EDR on web servers.  \n  - Watch for new admin sessions from unfamiliar IPs, plugin admin actions without prior interactive login, unusual child processes from web server processes (T1190, T1059, T1574.002).\n\n- **Endpoint exploitation & privilege escalation (WinBoat, MSSQL/SCCM, Windows Desktop Manager 0‑day)**  \n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Security/Sysmon, SQL/SCCM logs.  \n  - Detect browser/sandbox escapes, new services, token manipulation, or odd MSSQL/SCCM‑spawned processes (T1068, T1060, T1055).\n\n- **Email & identity (RedVDS BEC infra, internal email spoofing, phishing)**  \n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, M365/Exchange logs, IdP logs.  \n  - Focus on lookalike domains, anomalous inbox rules, OAuth consent grants, and internal‑looking mail coming from external IPs (SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail) (T1566, T1114.003, T1071.003).\n\n- **Data exfiltration and extortion (ransomware, Pax8/other breaches)**  \n  - Log sources: DLP, proxy, CASB, S3/Blob storage logs.  \n  - Hunt for large, atypical uploads to cloud storage, encrypted archives leaving the network, and mass access to file shares preceding such transfers (T1041, T1567.002).\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patching & hardening program updates**\n  - Ensure Fortinet, Palo Alto, Firefox, Windows (January Patch Tuesday), and any HPE Aruba / Bluetooth stack in use are tracked in patch SLAs and validated by vulnerability management.\n\n- **Inventory & exposure review**\n  - Refresh inventory of exposed admin surfaces: VPN portals, RDP, Windows Admin Center, SIEM, ServiceNow, n8n, Cal.com, WordPress; ensure WAF and strong auth are consistently enforced.\n\n- **AI & SaaS security governance**\n  - Formalize security requirements for AI assistants (Copilot, ServiceNow AI, Cursor): prompt‑injection awareness, data‑access scoping, logging standards, and approval process for new integrations.\n\n- **Identity & NTLM/NTLMv1 deprecation**\n  - Align with Microsoft and Google guidance on disabling NTLM/Net‑NTLMv1; plan phased rollout with test domains and monitoring for breakage, plus corresponding detection updates.\n\n- **Ransomware/data‑theft playbook refresh**\n  - Update IR runbooks to reflect data‑extortion‑only cases (no encryption), including legal/communications workflows and specific hunts for data staging rather than file encryption.\n\n- **Supply chain and CI/CD security**\n  - Review security controls for CodeBuild, npm, and internal CI/CD (secrets scanning, least‑privilege roles, artifact integrity checks); coordinate with dev teams for improved monitoring and SBOM usage.",
