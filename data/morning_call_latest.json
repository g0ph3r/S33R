  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Active exploitation of a WatchGuard Firebox zero-day RCE (CVE-2025-14733) with PoC publicly discussed; perimeter devices are at immediate risk.\n- Multiple identity-focused threats: Microsoft OAuth device-code abuse, new MFA-bypassing phishing kit, .onmicrosoft.com-based scams, and insider-access campaigns explicitly targeting banks.\n- Fresh PoCs and tooling (Linux kernel privilege-escalation bug, Nezha abused for C2, malicious npm package, Rust DDoS botnet) increase likelihood of rapid weaponization and follow-on ransomware or data theft.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **WatchGuard Firebox zero-day RCE (CVE-2025-14733) actively exploited**\n  - What happened: WatchGuard patched a Firebox RCE previously exploited in the wild; ~125k Internet-exposed devices reported vulnerable.\n  - Why it matters: If we or critical third parties use Firebox, compromise = full network foothold at the perimeter (VPN, routing, inspection bypass).\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Confirm with network team if any Firebox/WatchGuard gear is in use (including subsidiaries/third parties); if yes, verify firmware/patch level and emergency patch/mitigation status.  \n    - Increase monitoring for anomalous admin/API access, config changes, and unusual traffic patterns through any Firebox; request retro hunt in firewall logs for suspicious access to Firebox management interfaces.\n\n- **Microsoft OAuth device-code abuse & MFA-bypassing phishing (BlackForce kit, .onmicrosoft.com TOAD scams)**\n  - What happened: Reports describe attackers hijacking Microsoft cloud accounts via OAuth device codes, MFA-bypass phishing kits, and abuse of .onmicrosoft.com domains for TOAD-style credential and payment fraud.\n  - Why it matters: Direct impact on O365/Azure AD tenants, with realistic paths to bypass MFA and gain persistent access to email and cloud resources.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Hunt in Microsoft 365/Azure AD logs for anomalous device code sign-ins, consent grants, and sign-ins from new devices/locations, especially for privileged or finance-related accounts.  \n    - Tighten detections for suspicious inbound mail: “Your session expired / re-authenticate” themes, URLs using *.onmicrosoft.com* plus re-directors; coordinate with email team to quarantine similar campaigns and raise to phishing response.\n\n- **Nezha monitoring tool abused as stealth post-exploitation backdoor**\n  - What happened: Nezha, an open-source monitoring/probing tool, is being repurposed as a stealth Trojan for persistent C2/post-exploitation.\n  - Why it matters: Nezha may appear as benign monitoring traffic or agents while actually providing remote control on compromised servers.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Search EDR, ESM, and proxy logs for Nezha binaries/process names and unusual outbound traffic to Nezha-like control servers (non-standard monitoring destinations, odd ports).  \n    - If Nezha-like activity is found and not approved by infra/DevOps, treat as potential C2: isolate host, preserve memory/disk, and escalate to IR.\n\n- **Linux kernel POSIX CPU timers use-after-free PoC & Microsoft Brokering File System LPE (CVE-2025-29970)**\n  - What happened: Public PoC released for a Linux kernel use‑after‑free in POSIX CPU timers; separate disclosure of a Windows Brokering File System local privilege-escalation bug.\n  - Why it matters: Both enable attackers (or malware already inside) to escalate to root/SYSTEM; expect rapid integration into EDR-evasion, ransomware, and cloud workload compromise.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Prioritize monitoring for unusual kernel-level crashes, new kernel modules, and privilege escalation attempts on Linux servers and containers; verify critical Linux systems are on patched kernels where available.  \n    - On Windows, hunt for suspicious use of brokered file system paths or unapproved services gaining SYSTEM quickly after low-priv compromise; ensure EDR is deployed/enabled on all servers and jump hosts.\n\n- **Insider access campaigns specifically targeting banks & Rust DDoS botnet activity**\n  - What happened: Threat actors are openly recruiting insiders in banks and telecoms for paid access/data; separate analysis surfaced a Rust-based DDoS botnet actively targeting multiple services.\n  - Why it matters: Increased risk of malicious insider activity in financial orgs and potential DDoS against web/mobile banking and APIs around holiday peaks.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    - Increase scrutiny of privileged user behavior: unusual access to high-value datasets, off-hours activity, large exports, and atypical use of admin tools; alert on anomalous access from new locations/devices for staff with payment/ledger access.  \n    - Review DDoS protections and alerting on Internet-facing banking/portal/API endpoints; coordinate with network/ISP/CDN to ensure rate-limiting and traffic scrubbing plans are ready if volumetric anomalies appear.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Identity & OAuth abuse (device codes, MFA bypass, TOAD scams) – T1078, T1556, T1566**\n  - Log sources: Azure AD / Entra ID sign-in logs, OAuth audit logs, O365 unified audit, email security gateway.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Multiple device code auth attempts from unfamiliar IPs, “impossible travel” sign-ins, suspicious consent to new apps.  \n    - Inbound emails with login/Re-auth themes and links to *.onmicrosoft.com* or unusual third-party auth pages.\n\n- **Perimeter appliance exploitation (WatchGuard Firebox RCE) – T1190**\n  - Log sources: Firewall/VPN logs, appliance admin logs, perimeter IDS/IPS.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Access to management interfaces from the Internet, new or changed admin accounts, unexpected configuration exports, sudden VPN user enumeration or mass session creation.\n\n- **Post-exploitation C2 and dual-use tools (Nezha, Rust botnet) – T1071, T1105**\n  - Log sources: EDR, netflow, proxy logs, DNS.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Long-lived outbound connections from servers to low-reputation IPs/hosts posing as “monitoring” or “metrics,” unusual ports, or custom protocols.  \n    - Hosts initiating many outbound connections to different IPs in short intervals (DDoS-like patterns).\n\n- **Privilege escalation on Linux and Windows – T1068, T1548**\n  - Log sources: Sysmon, Linux auditd/journald, EDR.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Low-priv users spawning privileged shells, new SUID binaries, unexpected kernel panics or crashes.  \n    - On Windows, processes started as low-priv shortly followed by SYSTEM processes of non-standard binaries or services.\n\n- **Malicious packages / supply chain (fake WhatsApp npm package, Docker images) – T1195, T1554**\n  - Log sources: Developer workstation EDR, proxy logs, internal artifact registries.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - npm installs from public registry of new or rarely used packages in sensitive projects; scripts executing network calls or exfiltrating tokens/contacts.  \n    - Docker pulls of unapproved base images; execution of containers with outbound connections to unknown domains.\n\n- **Phishing & credential theft kits (BlackForce, TOAD) – T1566, T1110**\n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, web proxy, endpoint browser telemetry.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Repeated failed logins followed by successful login from different IP/device; browser-based password manager access shortly after visiting suspect URLs.  \n    - HTML attachments, QR-code based login flows, or look‑alike login pages in user-reported emails.\n\n- **Insider and data exfiltration – T1537, T1041**\n  - Log sources: DLP, database logs, file shares, VPN, CASB.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - Large exports of transactional or customer data, especially by users who don’t normally perform bulk extracts.  \n    - Sudden use of personal cloud storage, personal email, or unusual uploads from endpoints with privileged access.\n\n- **Ransomware ecosystem watch (Nefilim sentencing, RansomHouse tactics) – multiple ATT&CK (initial access to impact)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, AD logs, backup systems, network.\n  - Hunt for:  \n    - “Living off the land” execution (PsExec, PowerShell, WMI) from admin accounts, rapid file renames/encryption patterns, disabled AV/EDR services.  \n    - Unauthorized access or deletion of backup repositories and snapshot operations.\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Inventory & patch Firewalls/VPNs and other edge devices**\n  - Complete asset inventory of all perimeter appliances (including subsidiaries/critical vendors), confirm firmware patch status for Firebox and similar gear, and enable dedicated security logging.\n\n- **Cloud identity hardening**\n  - Work with IAM to tighten conditional access policies, reduce device-code auth exposure, require phishing-resistant MFA for privileged and finance-related accounts, and restrict app consent to admins.\n\n- **Developer and CI/CD security**\n  - Enforce allowlisting for npm and container images; adopt/expand use of hardened Docker base images; integrate SCA and malware scanning into CI pipelines.\n\n- **Insider risk program reinforcement**\n  - Review monitoring coverage for privileged users; coordinate with HR/Legal on awareness around recruitment by cybercriminals and clear reporting channels for suspected approaches.\n\n- **Linux and Windows kernel/LPE patch management**\n  - Prioritize scheduling kernel and OS updates for Internet-facing and critical systems; include LPE and kernel vulns in risk-based patch SLAs and regression-testing plans.\n\n- **C2 & “dual-use tool” baseline**\n  - Document and approve all legitimate remote monitoring and management tools (including Nezha-like platforms if any); block or tightly monitor anything not on the allowlist and tune detections accordingly.",
