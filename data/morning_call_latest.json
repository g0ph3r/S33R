  "morning_call_markdown": "### Executive Summary\n- Actively exploited Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) zero‑day (CVE‑2026‑20045) and related CISA KEV additions require immediate version‑specific verification and log review for unified comms/VoIP infrastructure.\n- Critical unauthenticated remote access issues (SmarterMail admin auth bypass, GNU Inetutils telnetd root bypass, Vivotek camera RCE, FortiGate config theft) increase external exposure risk, especially for internet‑facing services and network gear.\n- New Osiris ransomware and other campaigns heavily abusing LOLBins, RMM/proxyware tools, and cloud/SaaS integrations highlight the need to refine detections for “legitimate tools used maliciously” in Windows and cloud environments.\n\n---\n\n### High-priority items (immediate attention)\n\n- **Cisco Unified CM zero‑day RCE actively exploited (CVE‑2026‑20045 / CISA KEV)**\n  - What happened: CISA and multiple reports confirm active exploitation of a zero‑day RCE in Cisco Unified Communications Manager/UC components.\n  - Why it matters: High‑value VoIP/UC systems often sit in semi‑trusted network zones; compromise gives lateral movement, persistence and voice interception potential.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Identify all Cisco UC / Unified CM versions in use and confirm against Cisco/CISA guidance; ensure compensating controls if not patchable today.  \n    • Review last 30 days of UC logs, WAF/firewall, and NetFlow for anomalous requests to admin/API interfaces from the internet or unusual source IPs; elevate any suspicious activity for IR.\n\n- **SmarterMail critical auth bypass under active exploitation (no CVE yet)**\n  - What happened: A SmarterMail authentication bypass bug (patch recently issued, no CVE yet) is being exploited in the wild to hijack admin accounts; attackers already reversed the patch.\n  - Why it matters: If we (or third‑party suppliers) run SmarterMail exposed to the internet, attackers can gain admin, read mail, hijack accounts, or pivot into internal networks.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Confirm whether any SmarterMail instances are in our or key vendor environments; if present, verify latest version and restrict external access (VPN/admin network only).  \n    • Hunt for unusual SmarterMail admin logins (new IPs, odd geo, disabled 2FA, new accounts), config changes, or mass mailbox exports; treat as potential compromise.\n\n- **GNU Inetutils telnetd root bypass (CVE‑2026‑24061) + legacy Telnet risk**\n  - What happened: A critical flaw in GNU Inetutils telnetd allows trivial login bypass to gain root; advisory notes likely exploitation paths.\n  - Why it matters: Any exposed telnetd (especially on legacy Linux/Unix or embedded devices) is essentially unauthenticated root access from the network.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Use existing asset/scan data to identify any Telnet services (port 23) in corp, DMZ, or OT; prioritize those running inetutils.  \n    • Immediately block external Telnet at perimeter, alert on any Telnet use internally, and flag hosts running telnetd for urgent remediation/segmentation.\n\n- **FortiGate firewalls targeted to steal configuration data**\n  - What happened: Automated attacks against FortiGate firewalls are stealing configuration files from vulnerable devices (details suggest known Fortinet issues are being weaponized).\n  - Why it matters: Config theft exposes VPN users, internal IPs, credentials, and policy structure—prime data for follow‑on access and lateral movement.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Verify FortiGate firmware against latest Fortinet advisories; confirm admin GUI/API is not exposed to the internet and that strong MFA is enforced for admin accounts.  \n    • Hunt on FortiGate logs for suspicious downloads/“backup” actions of config, large responses to unusual IPs, new admin accounts, or log tampering.\n\n- **New Osiris ransomware + abuse of LOLBins, drivers, proxyware/RMM tools**\n  - What happened: New Osiris ransomware strain uses a bring‑your‑own‑vulnerable‑driver (POORTRY) plus extensive use of living‑off‑the‑land tools and dual‑use utilities; separate reporting notes proxyware malware disguised as Notepad++ tools and ongoing RMM abuse.\n  - Why it matters: These operations blend into normal admin activity, can evade basic AV, and are highly relevant to our Windows endpoints and privileged admin accounts.\n  - Recommended immediate actions for the SOC today:  \n    • Enhance hunts on EDR for: driver loading from unusual paths, unsigned/known‑vulnerable drivers, mass process termination, VSS shadow deletion, and atypical use of PowerShell/cmd/wmic/certutil/mshta (T1059/T1105/T1068/T1562).  \n    • Tighten monitoring and approvals for installation/use of RMM, proxy/VPN “helpers” and developer tools; escalate any unapproved Notepad++ plugins, “performance boosters,” or new RMM agents observed in the environment.\n\n---\n\n### Monitoring & detection recommendations\n\n- **Cisco UC / VoIP exploitation**\n  - Log sources: Cisco UC/CallManager logs, perimeter firewalls/WAF, NetFlow.  \n  - Monitor for: spikes in 443/8443/8080 to UC interfaces from unfamiliar IPs, login failures followed by success from new geos, unusual administrative API calls. (T1190, T1078)\n\n- **Auth bypass & email/portal compromises (SmarterMail, Zendesk abuse)**\n  - Log sources: Web server/email server logs, IdP/SSO, SaaS admin logs (e.g., Zendesk).  \n  - Monitor for: logins without expected MFA challenges, new API tokens, mass ticket/mail creation or forwarding rules, new or modified admin roles. (T1078, T1098, T1530)\n\n- **Legacy Telnet / network devices / Vivotek & other appliances**\n  - Log sources: NDR/NetFlow, firewall logs, device syslog (cameras, OT/IoT, firewalls).  \n  - Monitor for: inbound Telnet or HTTP/HTTPS to camera/IoT management ports from internet; sudden config changes or reboots; command execution logs from management interfaces. (T1046, T1190)\n\n- **Ransomware and LOLBins / driver abuse (Osiris, BYOVD, VoidLink AI‑generated malware)**\n  - Log sources: EDR, Windows Event Logs (Sysmon), AD, backup systems.  \n  - Monitor for:  \n    • Unexpected driver loads from temp/user directories; unsigned driver installation.  \n    • Massive file opens/writes, encryption‑like rename patterns, VSS deletion (vssadmin, wbadmin), backup job failures. (T1486, T1068, T1489, T1562)\n\n- **Abuse of RMM, proxyware, and dual‑use tools**\n  - Log sources: EDR, proxy logs, DNS, software inventory/MDM.  \n  - Monitor for: new or unusual RMM agents, “proxy” or “bandwidth sharing” apps, sustained outbound connections to unknown cloud/VPS, processes injecting into explorer.exe or browsers. (T1219, T1105, T1055)\n\n- **Phishing and social engineering (LinkedIn DMs + fake payment gateways & verification pages)**\n  - Log sources: Secure email gateway, web proxy, DNS, EDR on browsers.  \n  - Monitor for: clicks to newly registered domains mimicking payment brands, LinkedIn‑style lures delivering PDFs/archives, credential postings to external hosts, unusual UPI/financial redirects on endpoints. (T1566, T1204, T1556)\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS & AI tooling flaws (Chainlit AI cloud hijack, Zoom/GitLab RCE & 2FA bypass)**\n  - Log sources: Cloud provider audit logs, SaaS security tools (CASB, SSPM), IdP.  \n  - Monitor for: new OAuth app integrations, unusual token grants, new service accounts, admin‑level actions from atypical IPs; 2FA disabled/bypassed for high‑value accounts. (T1550, T1528, T1098)\n\n- **Infrastructure & DNS weaknesses (BIND 9 crash, Snap domain abuse, CISA ICS advisories)**\n  - Log sources: DNS server logs, package management logs, OT/ICS syslog where applicable.  \n  - Monitor for: malformed DNS queries causing BIND crashes/restarts, unexpected Snap package sources or repo overrides, outbound connections from ICS/OT beyond approved ranges. (T1499, T1195, T1565)\n\n---\n\n### Medium-term follow-ups\n\n- **Patching & exposure reduction for network/edge services**\n  - Ensure timely patching of Cisco UC, FortiGate, SmarterMail, Vivotek cameras, BIND, GitLab, Zoom, NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, and any exposed web/admin portals; enforce admin access via VPN only.\n\n- **Legacy protocol decommissioning**\n  - Plan phased removal or full isolation of Telnet and other legacy plaintext management (FTP, rsh); update hardening baselines to explicitly forbid inetutils telnetd in managed environments.\n\n- **Strengthen monitoring and governance of “legitimate” tools**\n  - Formalize policies for RMM, proxyware, automation tools, and browser extensions; maintain approved tool lists and EDR rules to alert/block unapproved variants.\n\n- **Ransomware tabletop and IR playbook updates**\n  - Incorporate Osiris‑style BYOVD and heavy LOLBin use into ransomware playbooks; test ability to quickly block driver installation, isolate endpoints, and preserve forensic artifacts.\n\n- **Cloud/SaaS and AI tool security review**\n  - Work with cloud and dev teams to review usage of AI/ML dev frameworks (e.g., Chainlit) and SaaS integrations (Zendesk, Appsmith, etc.); enable least‑privilege for tokens and central logging.\n\n- **Third‑party and supply‑chain oversight**\n  - Confirm key vendors (especially those handling email ticketing, customer portals, and call centers) are addressing SmarterMail, Cisco UC, and SaaS security issues; integrate security clauses and breach notification expectations where missing.",
