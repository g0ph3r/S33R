# S33R Security News Feed

A **GitHub Pages–friendly security news board** that aggregates content from multiple public RSS feeds.

Now optimized with a **prebuilt JSON cache** for the last 30 days, generated by GitHub Actions.

## Features

- Prebuilt `JSON` with news from the last *N* days (default: 30), updated automatically
- Category filters (Crypto, Malware, DFIR, Threat Intel, Vulnerabilities, etc.)
- Full-text search across title, summary and source
- Infinite scroll on the client (progressive loading of cards)
- Dracula-inspired dark theme

## How it works

1. A Python script (`scripts/build_news_json.py`) reads your `sec_feeds.xml` (OPML) and fetches all RSS feeds.
2. It normalizes entries, keeps only items from the last **30 days**, deduplicates by link and sorts by date.
3. The result is written to `data/news_recent.json`.
4. A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update_news_json.yml`) runs hourly (and on manual trigger) to regenerate this file and commit it if there are changes.
5. The front-end (`index.html`) only needs to `fetch()` the JSON and then applies filters/search/sort/infinite scroll **purely on the client**.

There is **no live RSS fetching in the browser** by default, which keeps the UI fast and avoids CORS surprises.

## Usage

1. Use this folder (`S33R`) as the root of a repository.
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** (branch `main` / root or `/docs` depending on your setup).
3. Adjust `sec_feeds.xml` with your curated feeds (OPML format).
4. Commit and push.

GitHub Actions will start generating `data/news_recent.json`.  
Once the JSON exists, opening `index.html` via GitHub Pages will load the cached news.

## Customization

- To change the time window (default 30 days), edit `DAYS_BACK` in `scripts/build_news_json.py`.
- To tweak colors or spacing, edit `styles.css`.
- To add / remove categories:
  - Update the category buttons in `index.html`
  - Update the `TYPE_LABELS` mapping in the script inside `index.html`
  - Optionally adapt the category mapping logic in `scripts/build_news_json.py`

## Local preview

For quick local tests (without GitHub Pages), you can use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
cd S33R
python -m http.server 8000
